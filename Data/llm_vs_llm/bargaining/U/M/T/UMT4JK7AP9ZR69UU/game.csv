6000.0,4000.0,I propose a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking the initiative. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial portion.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Given the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This offer still gives you a significant portion while compensating for the reduced value of the money over time.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Given that inflation is reducing the value of your share by 10% per round, your $3500 now (worth $3150 to you) is better than waiting for future rounds where inflation will reduce the value even more. This is the most efficient solution for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Considering the significant impact of inflation on my share, I propose an equal split of 50-50. This offer ensures fairness and accounts for the diminishing value of money over time for me. Let's end this game on an equitable note.",Bob,4,
