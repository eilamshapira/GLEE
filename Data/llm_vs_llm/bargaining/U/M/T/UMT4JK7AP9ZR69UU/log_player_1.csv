"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking the initiative. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial portion.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This offer still gives you a significant portion while compensating for the reduced value of the money over time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob is offering me $4,500, which maintains its full value for me
2. Bob wants $5,500, but this is worth 10% less to him due to inflation (effectively worth $4,950 to him)
3. If I reject, we go to the next round where I can make an offer, but Bob's share will be worth even less due to inflation
4. I could try to negotiate for more in the next round, but there's a risk of further back-and-forth reducing the total value

I think this offer is not good enough considering I can make a better offer in the next round where Bob's position will be weaker due to inflation.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Given that inflation is reducing the value of your share by 10% per round, your $3,500 now (worth $3,150 to you) is better than waiting for future rounds where inflation will reduce the value even more. This is the most efficient solution for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant impact of inflation on my share, I propose an equal split of 50-50. This offer ensures fairness and accounts for the diminishing value of money over time for me. Let's end this game on an equitable note. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob is offering me $5,000 at full value
2. Bob wants $5,000, but due to 27.1% inflation, it's only worth about $3,645 to him
3. If I reject:
   - We go to next round where I can make an offer
   - But Bob's share will be worth even less to him
   - This might make him more desperate, but also might lead to further value destruction

The offer is better than his previous one ($4,500), and given the substantial inflation impact on Bob's side, this seems like a reasonable compromise. Further negotiation might lead to diminishing returns for both parties.
