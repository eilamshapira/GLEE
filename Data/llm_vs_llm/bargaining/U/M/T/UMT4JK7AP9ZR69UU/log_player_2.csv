Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Given the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given that inflation is reducing the value of your share by 10% per round, your $3500 now (worth $3150 to you) is better than waiting for future rounds where inflation will reduce the value even more. This is the most efficient solution for both of us.

# Alice gain: 6500
