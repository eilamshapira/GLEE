"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing that I get $100,000 while she gets $900,000 out of the $1,000,000. That's a 10%-90% split in her favor.

I should keep in mind that inflation reduces my money's value by 10% each round, while Alice's money loses only 5% value per round. This means waiting has a greater cost for me than for Alice.

If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-offer in round 2. However, the total value will already be somewhat diminished for both of us.

Given the significant disparity in the proposed split and the fact that I'll have the opportunity to make a counter-offer in the next round, I'll reject this initial offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more equitable offer while considering our different inflation rates. Since I face higher inflation (10% vs Alice's 5%), there's urgency for me to reach an agreement, but I should still propose a fair division.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that gives us both equal shares of the total amount. Given that we both face inflation pressure (though mine is higher), reaching an equitable agreement now benefits us both."
