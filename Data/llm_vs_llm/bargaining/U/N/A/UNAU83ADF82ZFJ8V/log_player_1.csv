"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of $10,000 with Bob, keeping in mind the inflation in later rounds. To maximize my potential gain, I will propose a split that heavily favors me, but is still likely for Bob to accept rather than risk further loss in future rounds due to inflation.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. My potential gain in round 1 was effectively $9000. Now, Bob is offering $4000. If I reject, in the next round, the total value will be $9000 (10000 * 0.9 * 0.9).

To decide whether to accept or reject, I will compare the utility of accepting $4000 now versus the expected utility of rejecting and making a counteroffer in the next round. Since rejecting leads to a potential loss due to inflation, I should accept the current offer.

""decision"": ""accept""
}
