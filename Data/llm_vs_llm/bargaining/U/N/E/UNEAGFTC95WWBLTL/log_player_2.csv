"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both get an equal share and can finish the game immediately without losing value to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll carefully consider Alice's offer for a 50-50 split.

The offer would give me $50 and Alice $50, which is a fair equal division. If I reject and we go to the next round, the total amount will decrease by 20% to $80 total. Even if I proposed a split heavily in my favor next round, the maximum I could get (if Alice accepts) would be less than $80.

Since this is a fair offer that maximizes our collective outcome, and any delay will reduce the total amount available, I'll accept.
