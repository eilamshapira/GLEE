Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 as $60 for me and $40 for you. This way, we avoid losing value in future rounds due to inflation. Let me know if this works for you!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose we split the $100 evenly as $50 each. This way, we can both benefit equally without any loss from inflation in future rounds. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
