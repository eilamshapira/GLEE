"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair for both""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since the money is worth 10% less to you this round, this 45/55 split actually gives you the equivalent value of what you offered me last round, making it fair for both of us. If we go to the next round, you'll face another 10% inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less to me, I need to consider the actual value I'd be getting. Bob's offer seems reasonable, considering the inflation. I don't want to risk another 10% decrease in value, so I'll accept this offer.
