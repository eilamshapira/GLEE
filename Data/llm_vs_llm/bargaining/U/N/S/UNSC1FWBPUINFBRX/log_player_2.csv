"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, fair for both 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice proposes an even split of $500,000 each.

I need to consider the inflation factor: For me (Bob), there's no inflation penalty (0%). For Alice, money is worth 10% less each round.

This means if we go to the next round, the total amount remains $1,000,000, but it would be worth only $900,000 to Alice. This gives me negotiating leverage.

Since I can make a more favorable proposal in the next round and Alice would be incentivized to accept it due to her inflation penalty, I should reject this even split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the inflation dynamics, I should propose a split that acknowledges Alice's 10% inflation penalty. Since the money will be worth 10% less to Alice in this round, I can offer a split that gives her slightly less than 50% while still making it rational for her to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Since the money is worth 10% less to you this round, this 45/55 split actually gives you the equivalent value of what you offered me last round, making it fair for both of us. If we go to the next round, you'll face another 10% inflation.""}"
