"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. This offer is fair and benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is fair, given the inflation effect on my gains in future rounds.

If I reject, next round I can propose a division, but the money will be worth 20% less to me. So instead of potentially gaining $40 now, I'd need to secure at least $50 in the next round to make the same value ($50 Ã— 0.8 = $40).

Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, which is less than half but still a substantial amount. Given the inflation penalty I face if I reject, accepting now seems better than risking a negotiation where the total value decreases for me.
