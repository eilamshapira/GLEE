"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the money is now worth 10% less to me, so the total amount I'm considering is $100 * 0.9 = $90. I'll make an offer that gives me a bit more than half of this reduced amount.
