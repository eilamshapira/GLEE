"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe I deserve a larger share given the impact of inflation on my portion. This offer is still quite generous for you. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation impact on Bob is higher than on me, so waiting works in my favor. I'll make a new proposal in the next round that takes this into account."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Consider this carefully, Bob. Due to the 20% inflation penalty you face each round, your $350,000 now is worth more than a larger amount in the next round. This is a fair offer given our different inflation rates.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. Inflation is really eating into my potential gains, and this split is still very favorable to you. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With the current inflation rates, my $450,000 is still worth about 386,000 of original value, while Bob's $550,000 is only worth about 282,000 of original value. Continuing further would reduce both our gains significantly, and this split gives me a better real value than Bob, even though the nominal amount is lower."
