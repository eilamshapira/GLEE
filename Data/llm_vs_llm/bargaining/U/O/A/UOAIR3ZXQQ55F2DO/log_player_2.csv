Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Consider this carefully, Bob. Due to the 20% inflation penalty you face each round, your $350000 now is worth more than a larger amount in the next round. This is a fair offer given our different inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000
