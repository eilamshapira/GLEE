6000.0,4000.0,I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering that waiting will cost you more than it costs me due to higher inflation on your side (20% vs 10%).,Alice,1,

5500.0,4500.0,"Due to the 20% inflation penalty you face, this $4500 is now worth only $3600 to you, while my $5500 is worth $4950 with my 10% penalty. If you reject this, the next round will reduce your value even more significantly. This is your best option.",Alice,3,
