Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the inflation impact on both sides. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): With Bob's 20% inflation penalty, his $6000 is only worth $4800 to him now. My $4000 with 10% inflation is worth $3600 to me. I can make a better counter-offer in the next round that accounts for the increasing inflation pressure on Bob's side."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Due to the 20% inflation penalty you face, this $4500 is now worth only $3600 to you, while my $5500 is worth $4950 with my 10% penalty. If you reject this, the next round will reduce your value even more significantly. This is your best option.""}"
