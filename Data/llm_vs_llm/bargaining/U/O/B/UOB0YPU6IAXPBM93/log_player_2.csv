Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering that waiting will cost you more than it costs me due to higher inflation on your side (20% vs 10%).

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Due to the 20% inflation penalty you face, this $4500 is now worth only $3600 to you, while my $5500 is worth $4950 with my 10% penalty. If you reject this, the next round will reduce your value even more significantly. This is your best option. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
