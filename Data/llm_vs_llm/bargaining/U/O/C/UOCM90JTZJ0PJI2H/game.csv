600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, your offer was insulting.  While I value efficiency, I won't be taken advantage of.  I propose a 60/40 split, with me getting the larger share. This is a more fair and reasonable compromise that acknowledges the value of my negotiating skills. Let's reach an agreement before the money depreciates further.",Alice,3,

I'm proposing a 65/35 split, which is a generous offer considering the circumstances. Let's be practical and close this deal.",Bob,4,
