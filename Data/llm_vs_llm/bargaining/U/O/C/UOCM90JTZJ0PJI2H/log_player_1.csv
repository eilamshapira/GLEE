# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value yourself as a tough negotiator. However, time is money, and it's depreciating faster for you than for me. Let's be reasonable: I propose a 75/25 split in my favor.  This offer won't last forever.

I'm proposing a 65/35 split, which is a generous offer considering the circumstances. Let's be practical and close this deal.
