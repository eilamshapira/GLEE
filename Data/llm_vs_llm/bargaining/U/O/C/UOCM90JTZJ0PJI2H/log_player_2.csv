Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was insulting.  While I value efficiency, I won't be taken advantage of.  I propose a 60/40 split, with me getting the larger share. This is a more fair and reasonable compromise that acknowledges the value of my negotiating skills. Let's reach an agreement before the money depreciates further.
