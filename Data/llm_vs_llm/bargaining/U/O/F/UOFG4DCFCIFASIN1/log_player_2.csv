Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the inflation, the money is now worth 51.2% of its original value to me. To account for this, I will propose a division that considers this loss in value.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether to accept or reject the offer, I need to consider the value of the money after inflation.

Alice's offer in real value (considering 59.04% less):
Bob's gain: 420000 * (1 - 0.5904) = 420000 * 0.4096 = 172032

Since the value of the money is significantly decreasing with each round due to inflation, it might be strategic to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in the next round.
