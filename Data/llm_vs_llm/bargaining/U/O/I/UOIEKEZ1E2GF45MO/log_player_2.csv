Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 2, taking into account the inflation effect on my potential earnings:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000

I am proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, anticipating further depreciation in value in later rounds."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, considering the further depreciation (now 9.75%) and the increasing risk of losing everything, here's my offer for Round 4:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm lowering my ask slightly to increase the chances of acceptance."
