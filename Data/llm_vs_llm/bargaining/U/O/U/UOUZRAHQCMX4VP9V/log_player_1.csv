I'm starting with a generous offer, keeping 90% for myself and giving Bob 10%. This is a good starting point, and if he rejects it, I know he wants more, giving me a better understanding of his preferences for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to counter Bob's offer. He proposed a 60/40 split in his favor. This round, I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor, keeping in mind the inflation impact on both of us. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as such."
