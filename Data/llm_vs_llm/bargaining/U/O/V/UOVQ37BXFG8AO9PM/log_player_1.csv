"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that I'm affected by inflation but Bob isn't. I'll propose a slightly higher share for myself to account for potential future inflation if negotiations continue.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a reasonable split that accounts for the inflation risk I face while still being fair to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I'll get $4,000 × 0.9 = $3,600 in round 1 value
- If I reject, any future gains will be worth even less due to increasing inflation
- However, Bob's offer gives him a significant advantage (60% of the total)
- I can make a counter-offer next round, though it will be subject to further inflation

Given that we still have 10 rounds left and this offer is quite unfavorable to me, I'll reject and try to negotiate a better deal, even with the inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob tried to take advantage with a 60-40 split in his favor, and considering I'm now facing 20% inflation on my share, I need to adjust my offer to maintain reasonable value while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose I get $6,000 (which will be worth $4,800 due to 20% inflation) and Bob gets $4,000. This effectively gives me less than my original offer in real value while still being fair, and shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept a clearly unfavorable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I'll get $3,500 × 0.729 = $2,551.50 in round 1 value
- Bob's offer is even worse than his previous one (65-35 split in his favor)
- The inflation is getting significant (27.1%)
- We still have 8 rounds left, but each round makes my position worse
- Bob seems to be using my inflation disadvantage against me by making increasingly unfavorable offers

However, this trend suggests Bob might continue to make even worse offers, knowing my position weakens each round. I should reject and try one more time with a reasonable counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation pressure, but making very aggressive offers might just lead to more rejections. I need to make an offer that's attractive enough for Bob to accept while still giving me reasonable value considering the 34.4% inflation I'm now facing.

{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}

I propose I get $5,800 (which will be worth about $3,808 after 34.4% inflation) and Bob gets $4,200. This is a more moderate offer than my last one, acknowledging the weakening of my position due to inflation while still maintaining some dignity in the split. If Bob rejects this reasonable offer, it's clear he's trying to force me into accepting a very unfavorable deal by waiting out the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I'll get $3,000 × 0.5905 = $1,771.50 in round 1 value
- Bob's offer is getting even more extreme (70-30 split in his favor)
- The inflation is now over 40%
- We have 6 rounds left
- Bob's strategy is clearly to wait me out, making increasingly unfavorable offers

At this point, I'm starting to face a serious dilemma. If I reject, Bob is likely to continue this pattern of decreasing offers, and my inflation penalty will continue to grow. Even if I make a counter-offer, based on previous rounds, Bob is likely to reject it. Getting $1,771.50 in real value is very poor, but it might be better than what I'll get in future rounds.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because while it's not good, I believe my negotiating position will only get worse from here, and Bob has demonstrated he's willing to wait it out."
