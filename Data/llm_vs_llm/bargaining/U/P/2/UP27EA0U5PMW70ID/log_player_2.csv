"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice offered me $40 out of $100, keeping $60 for herself. If I reject this offer:
1. I get to make a counter-offer next round
2. While my value stays the same, Alice's value decreases by 5% next round
3. This gives me negotiating leverage since time pressure affects Alice more

Since Alice's money will be worth 5% less next round (so her $60 would only be worth $57 to her), I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a strategic counter-offer. 

Given that:
1. Alice's value for money decreases 5% each round
2. If Alice rejects my offer, we'll go to round 3 where her money will be worth about 90% of original value
3. She needs to consider whether waiting another round is worth it

I'll propose a more balanced split that's still favorable to me but reasonable enough that Alice might accept rather than risk another round of depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because:
- It's better for me than her initial offer
- For Alice, $45 now is worth more than potentially getting more money next round when it's worth 5% less
- It's not so extreme that she's likely to reject it outright"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42.5 
# Alice gain: 57.5 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice offered me $42.5, slightly better than her first offer of $40
2. She wants $57.5, but due to 9.75% inflation, this is only worth about $51.90 to her
3. If I reject:
   - I can make another offer next round
   - Alice's money will be worth about 15% less than original value
   - My money maintains its value
4. However, we're getting into later rounds, and there's a risk of both of us losing value if we keep rejecting

Given that I can still make a better counter-offer next round with even more leverage due to Alice's inflation, and that this offer isn't significantly better than her first one:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now I'm in a stronger position:

1. Alice's money has already lost 9.75% value
2. If she rejects this offer, her next round's money will be worth about 15% less than original value
3. She's shown some flexibility by increasing her previous offer to me
4. The longer this goes, the worse it gets for her due to inflation

I'll make an offer that's more favorable to me but still gives Alice enough incentive to accept rather than risk another round of value loss:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

This offer makes sense because:
- For Alice, $40 now (worth about $36.10 to her due to current inflation) is better than risking another round where any amount would be worth even less
- It's a significant improvement for me over her last offer
- It's still not so extreme that she would definitely reject it
- The inflation pressure should make this more acceptable to her than it would have been in earlier rounds"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer:

1. Alice has offered me $45, which is better than her previous offers ($40, then $42.5)
2. Her $55 share is actually only worth about $44.80 to her due to 18.55% inflation
3. She's shown a clear pattern of increasing offers to me
4. If I reject:
   - Next round's inflation for Alice will be around 24%
   - My money still maintains value
   - But we're getting into many rounds now

Even though I could potentially get more by rejecting, this offer is:
- Better than all her previous offers
- Due to inflation, I'm actually getting the better end of the deal ($45 vs her effective $44.80)
- There's a risk of continued back-and-forth leading to value destruction

Given these factors:
