60.0,40.0,Let's be fair and split it 60-40. It's a reasonable offer considering the inflation affects me more.,Alice,1,

31.0,69.0,"Alice, I understand your focus on fairness. However, if you reject this proposal, you'll have to wait another round, further reducing your share's worth due to inflation. Accepting 31 dollars now (worth 90% of its face value) is equivalent to what you’d expect to get if you waited, but without risking additional loss. I’m proposing 69 for me and 31 for you as a fair outcome based on our respective discount rates. Looking forward to a swift agreement!",Bob,2,

54.0,46.0,"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I think this split is more equitable given the inflation rates affecting both of us. Let's settle on this.",Alice,3,

31.0,69.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for an equitable split, but by waiting one more round you risk further losses—your money’s value will drop from 72.9% to 65.6% of its original worth. In equilibrium terms, 31 dollars for you now is as good as what you could secure later. Accepting this offer ensures that we both mitigate the effects of inflation. Let's settle on this division and move forward.",Bob,4,
