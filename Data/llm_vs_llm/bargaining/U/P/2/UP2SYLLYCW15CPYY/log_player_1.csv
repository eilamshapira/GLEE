Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your focus on fairness. However, if you reject this proposal, you'll have to wait another round, further reducing your share's worth due to inflation. Accepting 31 dollars now (worth 90% of its face value) is equivalent to what you’d expect to get if you waited, but without risking additional loss. I’m proposing 69 for me and 31 for you as a fair outcome based on our respective discount rates. Looking forward to a swift agreement! 
# Alice gain: 31 
# Bob gain: 69

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for an equitable split, but by waiting one more round you risk further losses—your money’s value will drop from 72.9% to 65.6% of its original worth. In equilibrium terms, 31 dollars for you now is as good as what you could secure later. Accepting this offer ensures that we both mitigate the effects of inflation. Let's settle on this division and move forward. 
# Alice gain: 31 
# Bob gain: 69
