"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair split. I'm offering $55 for me and $45 for you. This gives us both a good amount of money right away, and we avoid losing value due to inflation. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $45 out of $100
2. If I reject, the next round's money will be worth 10% less to me, so my $45 would become worth $40.50
3. I would need to propose a significantly better deal to make up for this loss
4. The split is relatively fair, though slightly in Alice's favor
5. There's risk in prolonging negotiations due to the inflation effect

Given these factors, it's better to accept a reasonable offer now rather than risk getting less value in future rounds.
