"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects our positions in this game. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""My turn now, let's make it a bit more interesting, shall we?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like you overestimate your position a bit. This is my counter-offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is 4500 * 0.9025 = 4061.25. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round, and then another 5% less, so it's 0.9025 * 0.95 = 0.857375. The money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round, and then another 5% less, so it's 0.64 * 0.95 = 0.608.

Considering this, I'll make my next offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5800, 
""alice_gain"": 4200, 
""message"": ""Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement before the money loses more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Let's end this before the money becomes worthless. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is 5000 * 0.8145 = 4072.50. 

Given the significant decrease in value and Alice's message, it seems like a 50/50 split might be the best option at this point.
