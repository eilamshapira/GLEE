"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a much more equitable division. You still get the larger share, but this is fair to both of us. Keep in mind that if we don't reach an agreement soon, inflation will reduce the value for me, and we both risk getting nothing if we drag this out for all 12 rounds. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
