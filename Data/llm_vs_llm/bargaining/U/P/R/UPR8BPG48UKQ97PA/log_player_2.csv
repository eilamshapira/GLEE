"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob.  Take this small piece, but I'm sure you'll be happy with it!   
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's offering me $10,000 while keeping $990,000 for herself, which is only 1% of the total amount for me. 

Given that inflation reduces the money's value by 20% for me each round, I should calculate if waiting might yield a better outcome. If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-proposal in the next round.

This offer seems quite unbalanced, and I believe I can propose a more equitable division in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, taking into account that we both need to reach an agreement and that inflation affects me each round.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a much more equitable division. You still get the larger share, but this is fair to both of us. Keep in mind that if we don't reach an agreement soon, inflation will reduce the value for me, and we both risk getting nothing if we drag this out for all 12 rounds.""}"
