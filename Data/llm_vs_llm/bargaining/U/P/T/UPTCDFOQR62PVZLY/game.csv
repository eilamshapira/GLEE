5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split of $10000: $5000 for each of us. Given that the money I receive loses 5% value with each round, it makes sense to settle now. I believe a fair, immediate agreement benefits us both. Looking forward to your acceptance!",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Given the inflation impact on my side, I'm proposing that I receive $6000 and you receive $4000. I hope we can reach an agreement quickly to minimize the loss from inflation. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",Bob,2,

4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Bob, I understand that inflation is eating away at our funds. To avoid further loss, I'd like to propose settling now: I get $4500 and you get $5500. This split reflects our current positionsâ€”especially considering that waiting another round will cost me an extra 5% in value and likely affect you as well. I believe this is a fair and pragmatic compromise that minimizes our mutual losses. Looking forward to your agreement!",Alice,3,
