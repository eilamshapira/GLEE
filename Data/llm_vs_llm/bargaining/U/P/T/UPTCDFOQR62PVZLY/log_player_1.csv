"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split of $10,000: $5,000 for each of us. Given that the money I receive loses 5% value with each round, it makes sense to settle now. I believe a fair, immediate agreement benefits us both. Looking forward to your acceptance!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Given the inflation impact on my side, I'm proposing that I receive $6000 and you receive $4000. I hope we can reach an agreement quickly to minimize the loss from inflation. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that inflation is eating away at our funds. To avoid further loss, I'd like to propose settling now: I get $4,500 and you get $5,500. This split reflects our current positionsâ€”especially considering that waiting another round will cost me an extra 5% in value and likely affect you as well. I believe this is a fair and pragmatic compromise that minimizes our mutual losses. Looking forward to your agreement!""}"
