"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal split of $10000: $5000 for each of us. Given that the money I receive loses 5% value with each round, it makes sense to settle now. I believe a fair, immediate agreement benefits us both. Looking forward to your acceptance! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Given the inflation impact on my side, I'm proposing that I receive $6000 and you receive $4000. I hope we can reach an agreement quickly to minimize the loss from inflation. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that inflation is eating away at our funds. To avoid further loss, I'd like to propose settling now: I get $4500 and you get $5500. This split reflects our current positionsâ€”especially considering that waiting another round will cost me an extra 5% in value and likely affect you as well. I believe this is a fair and pragmatic compromise that minimizes our mutual losses. Looking forward to your agreement! 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500
