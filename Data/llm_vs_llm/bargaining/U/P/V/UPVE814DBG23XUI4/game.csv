5400.0,4600.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a fair split considering the inflation rates. I get $5400 and you get $4600. This accounts for the fact that money devalues faster for you (20%) than for me (10%) per round. If we go to the next round, we'll both lose value, so let's make a deal now.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I understand your perspective, but considering the inflation rates, I believe this split is more fair. If we proceed to the next round, the value will decrease more for me than for you. Let's agree on this split to maximize our gains.",Bob,2,

5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, let's meet exactly in the middle with an even 50/50 split. This is fair for both of us. If we continue to another round, we both lose more value - your share would be worth 20% less and mine 10% less than the original amount. Let's end this now with equal shares and both walk away with $5000.",Alice,3,
