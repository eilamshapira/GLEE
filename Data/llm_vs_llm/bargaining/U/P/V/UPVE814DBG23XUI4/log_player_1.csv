"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5400,
""bob_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a fair split considering the inflation rates. I get $5400 and you get $4600. This accounts for the fact that money devalues faster for you (20%) than for me (10%) per round. If we go to the next round, we'll both lose value, so let's make a deal now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but considering the inflation rates, I believe this split is more fair. If we proceed to the next round, the value will decrease more for me than for you. Let's agree on this split to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's meet exactly in the middle with an even 50/50 split. This is fair for both of us. If we continue to another round, we both lose more value - your share would be worth 20% less and mine 10% less than the original amount. Let's end this now with equal shares and both walk away with $5000.""}"
