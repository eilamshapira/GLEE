"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a fair split considering the inflation rates. I get $5400 and you get $4600. This accounts for the fact that money devalues faster for you (20%) than for me (10%) per round. If we go to the next round, we'll both lose value, so let's make a deal now. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your consideration of the inflation rates. However, I think a fair split should account for the fact that the money devalues faster for me. How about I get $5500 and you get $4500? This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation rates. Let's make a deal now, so we don't lose value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but considering the inflation rates, I believe this split is more fair. If we proceed to the next round, the value will decrease more for me than for you. Let's agree on this split to maximize our gains.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's meet exactly in the middle with an even 50/50 split. This is fair for both of us. If we continue to another round, we both lose more value - your share would be worth 20% less and mine 10% less than the original amount. Let's end this now with equal shares and both walk away with $5000. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
