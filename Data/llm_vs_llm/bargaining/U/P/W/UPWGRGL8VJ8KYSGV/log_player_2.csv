"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 60/40. I'm aware that there's a 5% inflation for me each round, and I'm not sure if you face the same inflation. Let's avoid dragging this out and agree now, so we both win a significant amount. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing a 60/40 split in her favor, giving me $400,000 and herself $600,000. 

She mentioned she faces 5% inflation per round, but my instructions state I face 20% inflation per round. This means if I reject now and we go to the next round, the total value to me will be reduced significantly.

If I reject and propose a better split next round, the $1,000,000 will only be worth $800,000 to me due to my 20% inflation. Even if I got 100% of that amount (which Alice would likely reject), I'd only get $800,000 - already less valuable than accepting $400,000 now.

Given my high inflation rate, accepting now is my best option rather than risking further devaluation.
