"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- A 50-50 split seems fair at first glance
- However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round
- But with 5% inflation per round, my $5000 would become $4750 in the next round
- Making a counter-offer might lead to back-and-forth negotiation, further reducing value
- This is a reasonable first offer that gives me half the money without inflation loss
