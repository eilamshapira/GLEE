"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal: I take $3458 and you get $6542. Given that each delay costs us—10% depreciation for me and 5% for you—this offer reflects our best interests if we settle now. Looking forward to your acceptance so we can both avoid further value loss! 
# Bob gain: 6542 
# Alice gain: 3458 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the potential future value of the money if we proceed to the next round. 

In the current round, I would get $6542. 

If I reject this offer and make a proposal in the next round, the total amount of money would be worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice. Thus, the new total amount would be:
$10,000 * 0.95 (for me) = $9,500
$10,000 * 0.90 (for Alice) = $9,000

However, since the actual amount of money doesn't change, just its value to us, we still have $10,000 to divide. 

Considering Alice's offer, it seems reasonable, but I should think about what I could offer in the next round to maximize my gain, taking into account the depreciation.

For now, I will reject the offer to see if I can get a better deal in the next round.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Now it's my turn to make an offer. 

Considering the depreciation, I want to make an offer that is reasonable but also takes into account the fact that the money is worth less to both of us now.

In the previous round, the total value of the money to me was $10,000, and to Alice was $10,000. Now, the value to me is $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500, and to Alice is $10,000 * 0.90 = $9,000.

I'll make an offer that gives me a bit more than half of the original amount, considering the depreciation.

Let's say I offer myself $5,500 and Alice $4,500.

Here's my offer in JSON format:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the depreciation, I think this offer is fair. If you reject, the money will be worth even less to both of us. Let's settle now and avoid further losses.""}"
