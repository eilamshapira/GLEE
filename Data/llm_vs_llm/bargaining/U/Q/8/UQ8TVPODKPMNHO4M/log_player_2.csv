"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 100$ total, Alice is offering me 40$ and keeping 60$ for herself. This is not a perfectly equal split, but it's not terribly unfair either.

If I reject and move to the next round:
- I can make a counter-offer
- But the money will be worth 5% less to me (so the $100 pot is effectively worth $95 to me)
- I don't know how inflation affects Alice
- There's no guarantee Alice will accept my counter-offer

A guaranteed $40 now is better than risking a lower value in future rounds due to inflation. While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes accepting now more attractive.
