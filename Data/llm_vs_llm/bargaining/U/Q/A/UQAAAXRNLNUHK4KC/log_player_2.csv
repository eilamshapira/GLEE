"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice is offering me $40 out of the $100, while she takes $60. If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject, the $100 would be worth $80 to me in the next round. Even if I propose a more favorable split for myself in the next round, the declining value means I need to consider this carefully.

$40 now is better than potentially getting a larger percentage of a smaller pie. While the split isn't perfectly even, it's a reasonable offer.
