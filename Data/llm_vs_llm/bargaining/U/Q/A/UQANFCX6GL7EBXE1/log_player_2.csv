"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. We both walk away with substantial money, and it prevents us from losing value to inflation if we keep negotiating. This even split respects both of our contributions equally. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
