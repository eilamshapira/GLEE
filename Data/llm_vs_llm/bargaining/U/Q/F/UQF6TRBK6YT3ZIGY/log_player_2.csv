"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me 20% ($200,000) and keeping 80% ($800,000)
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less to me next round
3. In the next round, $1M would effectively be worth $800K to me
4. However, I would get to make the proposal
5. Given that Alice's money devalues more slowly (5%), I have more leverage to negotiate

Since this first offer is quite unfavorable and I still have many rounds left, I'll reject it. I can make a more balanced proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, considering our different inflation rates:

1. Alice's money devalues at 5% per round, while mine at 20%
2. I need to make an attractive enough offer to avoid prolonged negotiations
3. A more equitable split would be better than Alice's initial 20-80 split
4. Given that I'm at a disadvantage with higher inflation, I should still offer a decent amount to Alice

I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

This gives me a good portion while still being fair enough that Alice might accept, considering she faces less severe inflation pressure."
