"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it equally, it's fair for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of my first offer and equal split 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation, Alice's offer of 43 for me is actually worth 38.74 in round 1 terms.
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle of the previous offers, considering inflation it's a good deal for both.""}

My calculation:
45 in round 4 is actually worth 40.70, which is very close to Alice's first offer, and 55 for Alice is worth 44.85, which is close to my equal split offer."
