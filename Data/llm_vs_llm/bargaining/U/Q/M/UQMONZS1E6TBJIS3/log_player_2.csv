"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for herself. Let me think about this strategically.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. However, due to inflation, the total value will be worth 5% less to me (and 20% less to Alice). 

This means in the next round, the $1,000,000 is effectively worth $950,000 to me, and only $800,000 to Alice. Given Alice's higher inflation rate, I should be able to make a better offer for myself in the next round that Alice would still accept.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I now need to make a counter-offer. Let me think strategically:

The $1,000,000 is now worth only $950,000 to me due to 5% inflation, and only $800,000 to Alice due to 20% inflation.

Alice faces a much higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), which gives me leverage. If we go to a third round, Alice will face another 20% reduction, making the money worth only $640,000 to her.

Given this asymmetric inflation, I can offer Alice a deal that gives her more than what she would effectively get if she rejects and we go to another round.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering Alice $450,000, which is more than 56% of what the total amount is currently worth to her ($800,000). This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates, and it should be attractive enough for her to accept rather than risk another round of severe inflation on her side."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has now offered me $450,000 while taking $550,000 for herself. Let me analyze this carefully.

Due to inflation, the $1,000,000 pot is now worth:
- For me (Bob): 9.75% less than the first round, so effectively worth $902,500
- For Alice: 36% less than the first round, so effectively worth $640,000

If I reject this offer, we go to round 4, where:
- I'll face another 5% inflation (total ~14.75% from original)
- Alice will face another 20% inflation (total ~56% from original)

My $450,000 offer represents about 49.9% of the current effective value to me ($902,500), which isn't terrible. If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice might reject again, and we'd both lose significant value.

Given Alice's higher inflation rate, this offer of $450,000 is actually reasonable considering our relative positions and the risk of continued inflation.
