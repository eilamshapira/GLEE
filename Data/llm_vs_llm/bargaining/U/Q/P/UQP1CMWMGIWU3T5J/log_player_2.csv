"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000, while she would take $6,000. This means I would get 40% of the total.

If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. However, due to the 20% inflation, the total amount would decrease to $8,000. This means even if I proposed a 50-50 split in the next round, I would get $4,000 - exactly the same as Alice's current offer.

Since I wouldn't gain anything by rejecting and making a counter-offer (and could potentially lose if Alice rejects my next offer), I should accept this offer.
