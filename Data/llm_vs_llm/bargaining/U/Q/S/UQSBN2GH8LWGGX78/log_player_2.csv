"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split.  Let's get this done quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me only 10% ($100,000) while keeping 90% ($900,000)
2. This is clearly not a fair split despite her message
3. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less to me next round, but:
   - I can make a counter-proposal
   - The money will be worth 10% less to Alice next round
4. I have plenty of rounds left, and Alice's money devalues faster than mine
5. This gives me negotiating leverage for a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a more reasonable offer:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's do a fair 50-50 split. This way we both walk away with a good deal, and we avoid losing value through inflation.""}

Reasoning:
1. A 50-50 split is genuinely fair and hard to argue against
2. Alice's money devalues faster (10% vs my 5%), so she has more incentive to accept quickly
3. If she rejects, we both lose value, but she loses more
4. The message emphasizes fairness and the mutual benefit of reaching an agreement quickly
5. Starting with a reasonable offer builds goodwill for potential future negotiations"
