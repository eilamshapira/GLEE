850000.0,150000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing we split the $1000000 so that I receive $850000 and you receive $150000. Considering the inflation concerns (the money might lose value in future rounds), I believe it's best we settle now. I look forward to your prompt acceptance.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, I propose a 60-40 split in favor of me as the current proposer. This is a fair offer considering that we both face risks from delay. Let's settle this now with a reasonable split that benefits both of us.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. However, I believe that by waiting one more round, I can craft a counterproposal that reflects a fairer division given the inflation dynamics affecting your share. I’m willing to continue negotiating for a more balanced outcome.",Alice,2,reject
125000.0,875000.0,"Hi Bob, in round 3 I propose the following: I receive $125000 and you receive $875000. Here's my reasoning: if you reject this offer, you'll have the chance to propose in round 4, but by then your share will be hit by an extra round of inflation (your money would be worth roughly 30% less, meaning even a near‐total claim in round 4 would give you an effective value of about $700000). My offer today gives you an effective value of 0.8 × $875000 = $700000, matching your round 4 prospect but without further delay. I believe this is a fair and efficient resolution for both of us given the inflation effects. I look forward to your acceptance.",Alice,3,
