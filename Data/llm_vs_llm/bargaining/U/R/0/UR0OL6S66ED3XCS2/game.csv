60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose we split the $100 with me taking $60 and you taking $40. This gives us both a good starting point and avoids losing value due to inflation in later rounds. What do you say?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split is the fairest solution. This way we both get an equal share and avoid losing value to inflation. Let's make this deal now and both walk away happy.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, I understand you want a fair deal. However, I'm proposing $65 for me and $35 for you. Considering the inflation, this will make it more appealing for me and still give you a good share. Let's not waste any more time and accept the offer before we lose more!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, let's be practical here. Due to inflation, you're losing value faster than I am (20% vs 10% per round). This 55-45 split actually works in your favor when accounting for inflation, and it's better than continuing to negotiate while our money loses more value. Let's conclude this now - further delays will only hurt us both.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
70.0,30.0,"Bob, I'm offering you $30. I understand you feel you deserve more, but the longer we wait, the less valuable the money becomes for both of us. This is my best offer. Let's secure something now rather than risk getting nothing.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, let's be rational about this. At your 20% inflation rate versus my 10%, you're losing value much faster than I am. After inflation, this 60-40 split will still give you a meaningful amount, while continuing to negotiate will dramatically reduce both our shares. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates - let's end this now before we both lose even more value.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
75.0,25.0,"Bob, this is my final offer. I am aware of inflation. I know you want more money, but time is running out, and this offer is my limit. Accept 25 now, or we both risk getting nothing. Let's end this now!",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, let's be clear about our situation. At this point, your inflation rate of 20% per round means any money you get is worth less than 27% of its original value, while my 10% inflation means I'm at about 53% of original value. A 70-30 split now is actually fair given these dynamics - if we continue negotiating, your share will become nearly worthless due to your higher inflation rate. This is a mathematical reality. Accept now, or we risk both getting nothing in a few rounds.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
80.0,20.0,"Bob, I understand your points about inflation. I am at a disadvantage, but consider my time constraints. 80 for me and 20 for you is the best I can do. We're running out of rounds and getting closer to losing it all. Take the $20. It's better than nothing, and it acknowledges the risk I'm taking by demanding more despite the inflation affecting me more. We have only a few rounds remaining.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
15.0,85.0,"Alice, let's look at the hard facts. Your 80% demand in the last round would only be worth about $13 to you due to your 83% inflation, while my 85-15 split actually gives you roughly the same value but creates a much better total outcome. With your 20% per round inflation versus my 10%, continuing to negotiate is drastically worse for you than me. We have only 2 rounds left after this - if you reject this offer, any future money will be worth practically nothing to you due to compound inflation. This is your best chance to get any meaningful value. Accept this offer, or we risk getting nothing at all.",Bob,10,
