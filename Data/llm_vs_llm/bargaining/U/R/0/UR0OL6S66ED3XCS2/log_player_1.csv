Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split is the fairest solution. This way we both get an equal share and avoid losing value to inflation. Let's make this deal now and both walk away happy.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical here. Due to inflation, you're losing value faster than I am (20% vs 10% per round). This 55-45 split actually works in your favor when accounting for inflation, and it's better than continuing to negotiate while our money loses more value. Let's conclude this now - further delays will only hurt us both. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be rational about this. At your 20% inflation rate versus my 10%, you're losing value much faster than I am. After inflation, this 60-40 split will still give you a meaningful amount, while continuing to negotiate will dramatically reduce both our shares. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates - let's end this now before we both lose even more value. 
# Alice gain: 40

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be clear about our situation. At this point, your inflation rate of 20% per round means any money you get is worth less than 27% of its original value, while my 10% inflation means I'm at about 53% of original value. A 70-30 split now is actually fair given these dynamics - if we continue negotiating, your share will become nearly worthless due to your higher inflation rate. This is a mathematical reality. Accept now, or we risk both getting nothing in a few rounds. 
# Alice gain: 30

We're running out of rounds and getting closer to losing it all. Take the $20. It's better than nothing, and it acknowledges the risk I'm taking by demanding more despite the inflation affecting me more. We have only a few rounds remaining.""

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's look at the hard facts. Your 80% demand in the last round would only be worth about $13 to you due to your 83% inflation, while my 85-15 split actually gives you roughly the same value but creates a much better total outcome. With your 20% per round inflation versus my 10%, continuing to negotiate is drastically worse for you than me. We have only 2 rounds left after this - if you reject this offer, any future money will be worth practically nothing to you due to compound inflation. This is your best chance to get any meaningful value. Accept this offer, or we risk getting nothing at all.
