"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose we split the $100 with me taking $60 and you taking $40. This gives us both a good starting point and avoids losing value due to inflation in later rounds. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60 for herself. 
If I reject, the next round I can make a proposal, but:
- My $40 would be worth 10% less ($36)
- Her $60 would be worth 20% less ($48)

While her initial offer isn't exactly 50-50, accepting now would give me a solid $40. If I reject, the decreasing value due to inflation puts pressure on both of us, but especially on Alice. I could try to negotiate for a better deal, but there's also risk in prolonging the game.

Given that this is the first round and I have bargaining power with future rounds, I'll reject this offer to try for a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, considering that prolonging negotiations hurts both of us due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split is the fairest solution. This way we both get an equal share and avoid losing value to inflation. Let's make this deal now and both walk away happy.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a fair deal. However, I'm proposing $65 for me and $35 for you. Considering the inflation, this will make it more appealing for me and still give you a good share. Let's not waste any more time and accept the offer before we lose more! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this...

With 19% inflation for me and 36% inflation for Alice:
- Her offered $35 to me is worth $28.35 (after 19% reduction)
- Her $65 share would be worth $41.60 (after 36% reduction)

This is actually a worse offer than her first one, and she's trying to take advantage while the money is losing value. If I reject:
- Next round I can make an offer
- But my money will be worth 28% less
- Her money will be worth 48% less

The inflation is starting to seriously impact both of us, but her more than me. I still have leverage to negotiate a better deal, and this offer is worse than the initial one.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since we're now in round 4 and inflation is significantly impacting both of us, I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for the inflation difference between us.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical here. Due to inflation, you're losing value faster than I am (20% vs 10% per round). This 55-45 split actually works in your favor when accounting for inflation, and it's better than continuing to negotiate while our money loses more value. Let's conclude this now - further delays will only hurt us both.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you $30. I understand you feel you deserve more, but the longer we wait, the less valuable the money becomes for both of us. This is my best offer. Let's secure something now rather than risk getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation...

With current inflation rates:
- Her offered $30 to me is worth $19.68 (after 34.39% reduction)
- Her $70 share would be worth $28.67 (after 59.04% reduction)

This is an even worse offer than before! She's actually offering me less while trying to take more for herself, even though the money is worth significantly less to her due to her higher inflation rate.

We're in round 5 of 12, so there's still time to negotiate, but the inflation is becoming very serious. However, Alice's money is losing value much faster than mine (20% vs 10% per round), which means her bargaining position is actually getting weaker.

This offer is too low, and given the inflation asymmetry, I still have leverage to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","The inflation is getting serious now, and Alice's higher inflation rate means she's losing more value than I am. I'll use this leverage but make a reasonable offer to try to conclude this.

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be rational about this. At your 20% inflation rate versus my 10%, you're losing value much faster than I am. After inflation, this 60-40 split will still give you a meaningful amount, while continuing to negotiate will dramatically reduce both our shares. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates - let's end this now before we both lose even more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. I am aware of inflation. I know you want more money, but time is running out, and this offer is my limit. Accept 25 now, or we both risk getting nothing. Let's end this now! 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation...

With current inflation rates:
- Her offered $25 to me is worth $13.29 (after 46.86% reduction)
- Her $75 share would be worth $19.65 (after 73.79% reduction)

This is an extremely poor offer - she's actually offering me even less than before! While we're in round 7 of 12 and the inflation is severe, her strategy doesn't make sense because:
1. She's losing value much faster than I am (73.79% vs 46.86% so far)
2. She's asking for more money while her share is worth less
3. She's trying to pressure me by mentioning ""final offer"" but we still have 5 rounds left

Given that her money is losing value so much faster than mine, her bargaining position is actually quite weak. Rejecting this poor offer is still the rational choice.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","With the severe inflation impact, especially on Alice's side, I'll make a strong offer that emphasizes our current reality.

{""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be clear about our situation. At this point, your inflation rate of 20% per round means any money you get is worth less than 27% of its original value, while my 10% inflation means I'm at about 53% of original value. A 70-30 split now is actually fair given these dynamics - if we continue negotiating, your share will become nearly worthless due to your higher inflation rate. This is a mathematical reality. Accept now, or we risk both getting nothing in a few rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your points about inflation. I am at a disadvantage, but consider my time constraints. 80 for me and 20 for you is the best I can do. We're running out of rounds and getting closer to losing it all. Take the $20. It's better than nothing, and it acknowledges the risk I'm taking by demanding more despite the inflation affecting me more. We have only a few rounds remaining. 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this critical situation...

With current inflation rates:
- Her offered $20 to me is worth $8.61 (after 56.95% reduction)
- Her $80 share would be worth $13.42 (after 83.22% reduction)

This is an even worse offer than before! Let's consider the facts:
1. We're in round 9 of 12, so we have 3 rounds left
2. Alice's share is now worth only 16.78% of its original value
3. My share is still worth 43.05% of its original value
4. She's actually offering me less while asking for more

Her offer is irrational - she's demanding more money even though her inflation rate makes it worth very little to her. Her $80 is worth only $13.42 to her, while even a smaller amount would be worth more to me due to my lower inflation rate.

She's trying to pressure me with the remaining rounds, but her bargaining position is extremely weak due to her severe inflation. I'll reject this poor offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","With only a few rounds left and the severe inflation impact, I'll make a very strong offer that reflects our economic reality.

{""bob_gain"": 85,
""alice_gain"": 15,
""message"": ""Alice, let's look at the hard facts. Your 80% demand in the last round would only be worth about $13 to you due to your 83% inflation, while my 85-15 split actually gives you roughly the same value but creates a much better total outcome. With your 20% per round inflation versus my 10%, continuing to negotiate is drastically worse for you than me. We have only 2 rounds left after this - if you reject this offer, any future money will be worth practically nothing to you due to compound inflation. This is your best chance to get any meaningful value. Accept this offer, or we risk getting nothing at all.""}"
