"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest we split the money equally - a fair 50/50 division that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice offers a 50/50 split ($5000 each)
2. If I reject and move to next round:
   * I can make a counter-offer
   * But the money will be worth 5% less to me
   * $5000 now > $4750 next round (after 5% inflation)
   * I'm not sure how inflation affects Alice

A 50/50 split is generally considered fair, and with the inflation penalty for delaying, accepting now would be better than trying to negotiate for a slightly better deal in subsequent rounds where my share would be worth less.
