"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get $55 and you get $45. This gives us both a good portion, and if we haggle over multiple rounds, inflation will eat into our total. Let's settle quickly!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose an equal split of $50 each. This way, we both benefit equally without losing value to inflation over more rounds. Let's agree and finish the game! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
