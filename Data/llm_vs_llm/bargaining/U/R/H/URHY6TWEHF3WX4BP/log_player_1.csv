"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis of the game—and taking into account that although Alice’s money is not “inflated” over rounds, Bob’s available dollars lose 10% of their real value with each delay—we can work from the final round back to round 1.

Let the “nominal” dollars always add to 100. (In our analysis, we allow fractional dollars.)

• In round 12 Bob is the proposer. Knowing that if Alice rejects both get nothing, he can offer her 0 and keep 100.

• In round 11 Alice proposes. If Bob rejects, then in round 12 he would get 100 but its real (discounted) value would be 100×0.9 = 90 for him. Thus, to induce acceptance, Alice must give Bob at least 90. Her equilibrium proposal is:
  { ""alice_gain"": 10, ""bob_gain"": 90 }.

• In round 10 Bob proposes. If Alice rejects now, she will become the proposer in round 11 and secure 10 (since her share is not discounted). Thus her “reservation” is 10. Bob can then offer her exactly 10 and keep 90:
  { ""alice_gain"": 10, ""bob_gain"": 90 }.
But note that if Bob waits another round, the money he would later receive is effectively lower (90 later is worth 0.9×90 = 81 now). So an immediate 90 is preferable.

• In round 9 (Alice’s turn) Bob’s continuation value would be what he gets in round 10 (90 nominal), but waiting one round costs him 10% so his effective value is 0.9×90 = 81. Therefore, to get Bob’s acceptance in round 9 she must offer Bob at least 81, leaving her 19:
  { ""alice_gain"": 19, ""bob_gain"": 81 }.

• In round 8 Bob (as proposer) gives Alice her next-round guarantee. In round 9, Alice would secure 19 (without discount). So Bob offers her 19 and keeps 81:
  { ""alice_gain"": 19, ""bob_gain"": 81 }.

• In round 7 (Alice’s turn) Bob’s continuation would be the round‐8 outcome (81 nominal), but waiting makes it worth 0.9×81 = 72.9 to him. Therefore, Alice offers Bob 72.9, keeping 27.1:
  { ""alice_gain"": 27.1, ""bob_gain"": 72.9 }.

• In round 6 Bob similarly offers Alice her continuation (27.1) and keeps 72.9:
  { ""alice_gain"": 27.1, ""bob_gain"": 72.9 }.

• In round 5 (Alice’s turn) Bob’s continuation value (from round 6) of 72.9, discounted one round (×0.9), is 65.61. So Alice proposes:
  { ""alice_gain"": 34.39, ""bob_gain"": 65.61 }.

• In round 4 Bob offers Alice her round‐5 share of 34.39 and keeps 65.61:
  { ""alice_gain"": 34.39, ""bob_gain"": 65.61 }.

• In round 3 (Alice’s turn) Bob’s continuation (from round 4) is 65.61 nominal, worth 0.9×65.61 = 59.05 if he waits a round. Hence Alice proposes:
  { ""alice_gain"": 40.95, ""bob_gain"": 59.05 }.

• In round 2 Bob offers Alice her round‐3 share of 40.95 and keeps 59.05:
  { ""alice_gain"": 40.95, ""bob_gain"": 59.05 }.

Finally, in Round 1 (our current round, with Alice as proposer) Bob’s continuation value if he rejects is the round‐2 outcome of 59.05 nominal; but waiting one round reduces its value to 0.9×59.05 ≈ 53.14 for him. Therefore, to ensure Bob’s acceptance now, Alice should offer Bob at least about 53.14 dollars. That leaves her with 100 − 53.14 = 46.86.

Thus, the equilibrium proposal for Round 1 is:
{
  ""alice_gain"": 46.86,
  ""bob_gain"": 53.14
}

Let’s send that as our round 1 offer."
