"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for herself. This is a 40%-60% split in her favor. 

I need to consider:
1) The offer is asymmetric in Alice's favor
2) If I reject, we go to round 2 where I can make a counter-offer
3) However, in round 2, the total money will be worth 10% less (so $900,000 total)
4) If we keep disagreeing, we risk getting nothing

While I could counter-offer, the 10% decay per round creates pressure to reach agreement. My $400,000 now is better than potentially getting nothing later.
