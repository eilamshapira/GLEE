"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which means she would get $600,000. This isn't an even split, but I need to consider that inflation affects Alice more than me - her money loses 5% value each round, while mine doesn't depreciate.

If I reject and we go another round, I can make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it as well. Since we have 12 rounds maximum and Alice's money depreciates each round, I could potentially get a better deal by rejecting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a counter-offer that takes into account the inflation that affects Alice. The money is worth 5% less to Alice each round, so waiting is more costly for her than for me.

I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor given that I have the leverage of time.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, giving me $550,000 and Alice $450,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has slightly improved her offer to me from $400,000 to $420,000, which is a step in the right direction but still gives her a larger share ($580,000).

I need to consider that Alice's money is now worth 9.75% less to her due to inflation, so her $580,000 is effectively worth about $523,450 to her. Meanwhile, my $420,000 doesn't depreciate.

Given that I can make another counter-offer in the next round, and Alice's money will depreciate further (by 5% more), I think I can still get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice rejected my previous offer of a 55-45 split, I'll adjust my proposal. Considering that Alice's money is now worth 9.75% less to her due to inflation, and will continue to depreciate by 5% each round, I'll make an offer that's still favorable to me but more appealing to Alice than waiting further.

{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000}

I propose a 52-48 split, giving me $520,000 and Alice $480,000. This is a more balanced split than my previous offer, and given the inflation pressure on Alice, it should be more attractive for her to accept now rather than wait for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer again, now offering me $440,000 (up from $420,000 previously).

Due to inflation, Alice's share of $560,000 is now worth about 18.55% less to her, making it equivalent to roughly $456,120 in original value. My share doesn't depreciate.

Alice seems to be slowly increasing her offers to me, but we still have 7 more potential rounds, and her money will continue to depreciate by 5% each round. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer that might be more favorable to me.

However, we're also getting closer to the 12-round limit where we both get nothing. I'll reject this offer and make a slightly more generous counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice has rejected my previous offers and we're now in round 6, I need to be more strategic. Alice's money has already depreciated by 18.55% due to inflation, and will continue to depreciate by 5% each round. We're halfway through our maximum of 12 rounds, so the risk of getting nothing is becoming more significant.

I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for the depreciation Alice faces while still being favorable to me:

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose an even 50-50 split, giving each of us $500,000. This is a fair division that should be appealing to Alice given the inflation pressure she faces. It shows I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement before we reach the 12-round limit where we both get nothing."
