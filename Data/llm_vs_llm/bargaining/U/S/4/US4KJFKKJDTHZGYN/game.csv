900000.0,100000.0,Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. This is a good start for both of us.,Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Let's meet in the middle, 60% for me and 40% for you is more than fair.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 40%.  Let's split it 80/20 this time.  We're both taking a hit from inflation, so let's make this work.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I'm willing to compromise too. 55% for me and 45% for you is a fair deal, considering I'm losing value each round.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
700000.0,300000.0,We're both losing out with each round. Let's be reasonable. I'll go down to 70% and you can have 30%.  We need to make a deal soon or we'll both lose everything.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"We're running out of time. I'm willing to split it 50/50, even though I'm losing nearly 20% of the value. Let's end this and walk away with something.",Bob,6,
