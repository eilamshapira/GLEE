"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a high offer to maximize my potential gains, recognizing the pressure of inflation in later rounds. I'm hoping Bob will accept this advantageous offer early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Reasoning: Even with the inflation penalty of 10% for this round, getting only $100,000 is unacceptable. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds, especially considering Bob's revealed preference for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, considering Bob rejected my initial offer and countered with an extremely selfish one, I need to adjust my strategy. I'm still aiming for a significant portion, but I need to be realistic about the decreasing value of the money for me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```

Reasoning: I'm reducing my demand significantly from Round 1, offering Bob a more substantial piece of the pie. This is still a favorable deal for me, especially when considering the 20% inflation penalty I'll face if we go to Round 4. Hopefully, this will be enough to entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Reasoning: This is still a bad deal for me. The money I get is not worth that much if I get only 250000. I think I can get a better offer by round 5."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's clear Bob is playing hardball. I need to consider the increasing inflation penalty more seriously. If we go to round 6, my gains will be worth ~41% less than round 1. I still want a reasonable profit, so I'll try a more conciliatory offer, but with a floor.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

Reasoning: I'm offering a much more significant chunk to Bob this time. $600,000, even with the inflation hit, is still a worthwhile amount for me at this stage. This represents a considerable compromise on my part, and I hope it signals to Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement before the value diminishes further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Reasoning: Okay, this is getting close to the wire. While I'm still losing a significant amount of value to inflation (40.95%!), $400,000 is still a decent amount to walk away with. Given Bob's consistent desire for the larger share and the rapidly approaching deadline, it's the most rational decision to accept this offer now rather than risk getting nothing in the remaining rounds."
