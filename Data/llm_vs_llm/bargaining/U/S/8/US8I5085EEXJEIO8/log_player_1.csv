"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept, given that inflation will hurt my gains if we go to another round.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a slight advantage as the first mover
2. It's fair enough that Bob might accept rather than risk the next round
3. If Bob rejects, my next potential gain will be reduced by 20% due to inflation, so I'm motivated to make a reasonable first offer"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $500,000, but due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $400,000 to me
   * This is less than what I could have gotten if Bob accepted my first offer

2. If I reject:
   * I can make another offer next round
   * But the money will be worth even less (another 20% less)
   * My next round's money would be worth only 64% of original value

3. Bob's offer is completely equal split, which is fair in nominal terms
   * But due to different inflation rates, it's actually advantageous for Bob

Given that rejecting would lead to even more severe inflation penalties for me, and the current offer is still substantial, I should accept.
