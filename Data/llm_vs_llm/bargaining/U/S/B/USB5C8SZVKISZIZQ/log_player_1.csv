"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to factor in the inflation rates for both myself and Bob. Since this is round 1, I'll aim for a fair division, but slightly in my favor considering I'm the one making the initial offer and facing higher inflation.

Here's my proposal:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

Explanation: I'm offering myself $5500 and Bob $4500. This gives me a slightly larger share, but hopefully not so much that Bob rejects it outright, forcing us into further rounds where inflation will eat into both our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my initial offer and now he's proposing $4000 for me and $6000 for himself. I need to calculate the current value of his offer, taking into account the inflation.

*   **My Inflation:** The money is worth 20% less to me than in the first round. So, $4000 now is worth $4000 * (1 - 0.20) = $3200 in round 1 terms.
*   **Bob's Inflation:** The money is worth 5% less to Bob than in the first round.

Considering that the money is worth so much less to me now and Bob is getting a larger share to compensate for his lower inflation rate, I think it's reasonable to accept the offer.
