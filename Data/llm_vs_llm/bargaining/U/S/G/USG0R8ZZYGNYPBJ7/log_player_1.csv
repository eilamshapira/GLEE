"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 10, ""bob_gain"": 90, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I take $10 and you get $90. If you reject and become the proposer in round 2, you'll face a 10% discount on the full $100—effectively reducing your gain to about $90 in terms of today's value. Accept this offer now and secure the full value for your share. Looking forward to your prompt agreement!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the 10% discount I'm already facing, I think this is a fair offer. If you reject, I'll face another discount, but you'll risk getting less in the next round. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, I'll decline this proposal. As my share’s value remains constant over rounds while yours gets discounted further as the game continues, I believe I can secure a better outcome in the next round if I become the proposer. Let's keep negotiating!""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 12, ""bob_gain"": 88, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in round 3 I propose the following: I take $12 and you get $88. Remember that in this round your money’s face value is worth only 80% of its nominal value, so your effective value is 0.8 × 88 = $70.4. If you reject and get to propose in round 4, you'll face an even steeper discount, making your potential outcome lower. I believe this offer reflects a fair compromise given the inflation penalty you incur each round. Let’s avoid further losses—please accept this offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, despite the inflation penalty, I still think I deserve a larger share. Considering the discount I'm facing, my effective gain would be around $68. I'm willing to take that risk and propose this offer. If you reject, the discount will only increase, but you'll also risk getting a lower offer in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. However, I must decline. While your share is understandably affected by inflation, my share remains at full value. By waiting until round 5, I anticipate having the flexibility to propose a division that better reflects these dynamics before the discount deepens further on your side. Let's continue negotiating for an outcome that works for both of us.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 9.5, ""bob_gain"": 90.5, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, for round 5 my proposal is as follows: I take $9.50 (which retains its full value for me), and you get $90.50. Remember that in this round, your money is discounted by 0.9⁴ (approximately 65.61% of its nominal value), so your effective gain would be 90.5 × 0.6561 ≈ $59.39. By accepting this offer, you secure slightly more effective value than the fallback you’d have if you waited until round 6—with the discount worsening to about 59.05% of the nominal amount. I believe this deal respects our respective discount schedules and minimizes further losses. Looking forward to your agreement!""}"
