Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your previous offer was simple, but I'm taking inflation into account. I'm offering a more equitable split considering the diminishing value of the money for me. This is a fair offer given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
