"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the offer from Alice of an equal split ($5000 for each of us), I'll evaluate this decision carefully.

This is a fair 50-50 split, which represents an equitable division of the money. While I might be able to negotiate for more in future rounds, there are several factors to consider:

1. Each rejection leads to another round, and we only have 12 rounds total
2. I'm told there's no inflation for me (0%), but I don't know Alice's inflation rate
3. If we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing

Since this is round 1 and the offer is perfectly fair, I'll accept this proposal.
