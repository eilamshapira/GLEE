"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether it's better to accept Alice's offer of $400,000 for me and $600,000 for her, or to reject and make a counter-offer knowing that the total value will decrease by 5% for me and 10% for Alice.

If I reject, the $1,000,000 will be worth $950,000 to me and $900,000 to Alice in the next round. This difference in inflation rates gives me some leverage.

Given that Alice faces a steeper inflation penalty, I believe I can propose a more favorable split in the next round. The current offer gives me 40% of the pot, which isn't particularly fair.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make a counter-proposal that accounts for our different inflation rates. Alice faces higher inflation (10% per round) than I do (5% per round), which gives me some negotiating leverage.

I'll propose a more balanced split that's still advantageous to Alice but closer to equal than her initial offer.

{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000}

I'm proposing a 48%-52% split in Alice's favor. This is significantly more balanced than the initial 40%-60% split she proposed, while still giving her the larger share. Given that she faces 10% inflation if she rejects this offer, while I only face 5%, this should be an attractive proposition for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Current offer: $450,000 for me, $550,000 for Alice

Due to inflation so far:
- My $450,000 is worth about $406,125 (9.75% reduction)
- Alice's $550,000 is worth about $445,500 (19% reduction)

If I reject and we go to round 4:
- I'll face additional 5% inflation (total ~14.75%)
- Alice will face additional 10% inflation (total ~29%)
- This means the $1,000,000 pie would be worth around $852,500 to me and $710,000 to Alice

Alice has improved her offer from the initial 60-40 split to a 55-45 split, which shows she's willing to negotiate. Given the inflation penalties we're both facing and the improvement in the offer terms, accepting appears to be the rational choice.
