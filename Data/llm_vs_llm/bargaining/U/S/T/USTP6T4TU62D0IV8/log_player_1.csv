Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be generous, but 60/40 is too far off. How about we go with 55/45? 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Okay, time to adjust my strategy. Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I need to make a proposal that's more appealing while still accounting for my loss of value.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Okay Bob, I'm meeting you in the middle, close to your 55/45. How about 52/48? Remember inflation is hurting us both!""
