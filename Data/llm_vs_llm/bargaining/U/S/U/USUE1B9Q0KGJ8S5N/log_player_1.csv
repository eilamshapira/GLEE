"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 52/48 split is fairer, considering the inflation risk.  It's still a good deal for you, and gives me a little more security. Let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
