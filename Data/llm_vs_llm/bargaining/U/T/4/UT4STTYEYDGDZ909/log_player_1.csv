"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering that inflation will affect my gains in future rounds if Bob declines.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division because it's close to equal but gives me a slight advantage as the first mover. It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting it, especially since delaying would mean we both risk losing value due to inflation."
