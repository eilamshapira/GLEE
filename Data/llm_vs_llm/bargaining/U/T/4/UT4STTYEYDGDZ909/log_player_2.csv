"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is for me (Bob) to receive $450,000 while she takes $550,000. 

If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, but due to inflation, the total value will be worth 10% less to me. So the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $900,000 to me in the next round.

Given that Alice's current offer gives me $450,000, which is 45% of the total, and inflation will reduce my potential gain in future rounds, I'll accept this offer.
