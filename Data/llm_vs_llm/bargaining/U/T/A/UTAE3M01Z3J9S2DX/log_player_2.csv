"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I’m offering you $655173 and I’ll take $344827. Considering that further rounds will erode our amounts (my share by 10% and yours by 5% per round), accepting this offer now is in both our best interests. Let’s avoid unnecessary loss of value—please accept the offer. 
# Bob gain: 655173 
# Alice gain: 344827 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully, considering the inflation rates.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value decreases by 5% for me and 10% for Alice. This gives me some leverage, but I also lose absolute value.

Alice is offering me $655,173 (65.5%) of the money, which is already significantly more than half. This is a generous first offer that accounts for our different inflation rates.

If I reject, I could potentially get a higher percentage in the next round, but the total pie would be smaller. Since I'm already being offered well over half the money, and further negotiations would reduce the absolute amount I receive, accepting now seems optimal.
