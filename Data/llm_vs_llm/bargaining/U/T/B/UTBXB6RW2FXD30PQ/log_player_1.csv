"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Since we both want to maximize our share, but also need to consider the time pressure and Bob's 20% inflation penalty per round, I'll propose a division that gives me a significant portion but is still fair enough that Bob might accept it.

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I propose that I receive $800,000 and Bob receives $200,000. This is a substantial offer for me, but Bob should consider that with each passing round, his money will be worth 20% less, so accepting a smaller amount now might be better than waiting for a potentially larger amount later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to consider the inflation effect on Bob more carefully. By round 3, Bob's inflation penalty means each dollar is worth about 64% of its original value to him (after two 20% reductions). I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for this.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

I propose that I receive $650,000 and Bob receives $350,000. This gives Bob a more substantial portion than my first offer, acknowledging that we both need to reach an agreement. Since Bob faces a 20% inflation penalty per round, this $350,000 now is worth more to him than potentially waiting for more in future rounds when his purchasing power will be further reduced."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
