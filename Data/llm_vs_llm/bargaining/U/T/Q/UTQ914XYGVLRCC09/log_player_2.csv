"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me, $600,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   * My money will be worth 10% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 20% less
3. This means in the next round:
   * $1 will be worth $0.90 for me
   * $1 will be worth $0.80 for Alice

The current offer gives me $400,000, which is a bit low considering it's a 40/60 split. Since Alice's money devalues faster than mine (20% vs 10%), I have some leverage to negotiate for a better deal. If I make a counter-offer next round, Alice will be more inclined to accept due to her higher depreciation rate.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a strategic counter-offer considering our different depreciation rates.

For Alice, the money is now worth 20% less, so she's more pressured to accept. However, I shouldn't be too aggressive as she might still reject and the money will depreciate further for both of us.

A fair but advantageous split would be:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This offer is reasonable because:
1. It gives me a better share than her initial 40/60 split
2. If Alice rejects, her next round money will be worth even less (another 20% drop)
3. The split is not too extreme to provoke an automatic rejection
4. The total still adds up to 1,000,000"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is now offering a 50/50 split ($500,000 each)
2. Due to inflation:
   * My $500,000 is effectively worth $405,000 (19% less)
   * Alice's $500,000 is effectively worth $320,000 (36% less)
3. If I reject:
   * Next round my money will be worth 29% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 56% less
   * The difference in depreciation is becoming more significant

This is actually a good offer because:
1. It's a fair 50/50 split
2. The inflation penalty is already significant
3. Further negotiations would lead to even more value loss
4. Alice has moved significantly from her initial position (from 60/40 to 50/50)
