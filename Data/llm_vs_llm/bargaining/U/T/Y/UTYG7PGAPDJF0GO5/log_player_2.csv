While not ideal, I'm willing to gamble a few more rounds to try and secure a better outcome. The inflation is hurting me more than Alice right now, so she may be more willing to compromise as time goes on."

This is cutting it close, but the inflation is really eating into my potential gains. Accepting a 50/50 split at this point is better than risking getting nothing at all in later rounds."
