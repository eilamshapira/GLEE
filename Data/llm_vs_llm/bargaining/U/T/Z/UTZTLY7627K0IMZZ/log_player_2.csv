"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice's offer gives me $400,000, which is a substantial amount, but less than half of the total $1,000,000. Since I would get to make the next offer if I reject, I could propose a more favorable split. However, Alice could then reject my offer, and we might enter a cycle of rejections. The current offer gives me 40% of the total, which is significant.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer that's still attractive to Alice to increase the chances of acceptance. I'll propose a slight advantage for myself while keeping it fair enough that Alice would likely accept rather than reject and make a counter-offer.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is an interesting development. Alice has made a more reasonable offer than her first one, giving me $450,000 (45% of the total). While it's still slightly in her favor, it's much closer to an even split. If I reject, we'll continue the game, but there's a risk that subsequent offers might be worse. This is a fairly reasonable offer, and the difference between this and a 50-50 split isn't worth the risk of getting a worse deal later.
