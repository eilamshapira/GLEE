"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for herself
2. If I reject, we go to the next round where:
   * My money will be worth 20% less
   * Her money will be worth 5% less
   * I get to make the next offer

If I reject and we go to next round:
- My $400K would be worth only $320K
- Her $600K would be worth $570K

Even if I make a better offer next round, the significant 20% depreciation on my side makes this current offer somewhat attractive. However, I believe I can make a more favorable offer in the next round despite the depreciation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given the depreciation rates, I need to factor in that Alice knows any money she gets will be worth 5% less than in round 1, while any money I get will be worth 20% less. I should make an offer that's attractive enough for her to accept, considering she can always reject and make a counter-offer.

If I propose too greedy an offer, she'll likely reject, and we'll go to round 3 where my money will depreciate another 20%. I need to find a balance that's better for me than the first offer but still acceptable to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

This 50-50 split is fair and should be attractive to Alice because:
1. It's better than what she'd get if we keep going due to her 5% depreciation rate
2. It's a psychologically appealing equal split
3. She gets less than her initial offer but avoids further depreciation"
