"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $100 between myself (Alice) and Bob.

Given the inflation rates (10% for me, 20% for Bob per round), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. However, since I'm making the first offer, I should propose something fair but that also recognizes my advantage as the first mover.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because it gives both of us a substantial portion of the money while slightly favoring my position as the first mover. If Bob rejects this offer, we'll move to the next round where the total value decreases to 90% for me and 80% for Bob. This gives Bob an incentive to accept a reasonable first offer rather than waiting to make his own proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer for round 3, considering the increasing inflation costs for both of us.

At this point, due to inflation, each dollar is worth only 80% of its original value for me (after two rounds of 10% inflation), and only 64% of its original value for Bob (after two rounds of 20% inflation).

Given these diminishing returns, it's becoming increasingly important to reach an agreement soon.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose an even 50-50 split. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges Bob's position while also recognizing that inflation is hurting him more than me. If Bob rejects this offer, we'll move to round 4 where the money will be worth even less for both of us, but especially for him. A 50-50 split at this point would give us both more value than continuing to negotiate."
