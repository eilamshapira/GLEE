550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob! Since we both want to come to an agreement, I'm offering a fairly balanced split. You get $450000 and I get $550000. This is fair because inflation doesn't affect me, but each round reduces the value of your money by 10%. If we delay, your share becomes worth less to you with each round. This deal gives you maximum value right now!",Alice,1,
