"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since we both want to come to an agreement, I'm offering a fairly balanced split. You get $450000 and I get $550000. This is fair because inflation doesn't affect me, but each round reduces the value of your money by 10%. If we delay, your share becomes worth less to you with each round. This deal gives you maximum value right now! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $450,000 (45%) and taking $550,000 (55%)
2. She's right that inflation affects only me, losing 10% value each round
3. If I reject, my next offer would need to be compelling enough for her to accept
4. If we go too many rounds, we both risk getting nothing
5. $450,000 now is better than a potentially larger sum later due to inflation

This is actually a reasonable first offer considering the inflation penalty only affects me. If I reject and we go another round, my $450,000 would already be worth only $405,000 to me.
