"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 789881.91 
# Alice gain: 210118.09 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Current value: $1,000,000
2. I'm being offered: $789,881.91 (about 79%)
3. Alice takes: $210,118.09 (about 21%)
4. If I reject, next round:
   - Money worth 5% less to me
   - Money worth 10% less to Alice
   - I get to make the offer

This is actually a pretty good offer:
- I get a significant majority (79%)
- Inflation will hurt both of us if we continue
- Alice's offer is fair considering she moved first
- Further negotiation might risk losing value
