"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 689655, ""bob_gain"": 310345, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – let’s settle quickly to avoid further value loss. In view of our respective discount rates (roughly 5% for me and 10% for you per round), I propose that I receive $689,655 and you $310,345. This division reflects the equilibrium split in an alternating‐offers setting. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe a more equitable split considering our different rates of value loss would be for me to receive $600000 and you to receive $400000. This way, we can still settle quickly but with a fairer distribution given the higher impact of delay on my share. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter‐offer, but given the future prospects and my upcoming opportunity to propose in round 3, I believe I can achieve a division more favorable to my position. Let's continue negotiating.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 605000, ""bob_gain"": 395000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 3. Given that by now the dollar’s value has declined to 90% of its original worth for me and 80% for you, I’m trying to reach an outcome that accounts for these differences. With my offer, I’d get $605,000 (a 90% effective value of about $544,500) and you would receive $395,000 (an 80% effective value of roughly $316,000). This effective amount for you is intended to match what you could reasonably expect if you became the proposer next round – all while avoiding further erosion of our gains. I hope you see the logic and agree to settle now. Looking forward to your reply!""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your last proposal, but I feel it still doesn't adequately address the significant impact of inflation on my share. Considering the money is now worth 27.1% less for me and 14.26% less for you compared to the first round, I propose a split where I receive $550000 and you receive $450000. This offer takes into account the urgency to settle and the disproportionate effect of delay on my side. Let's agree on this to minimize further loss. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. With your proposal, at the current discount rates my $450,000 translates to an effective value of about $385,800 (after a 14.26% reduction), while your $550,000 is roughly equivalent to $400,950 (after a 27.1% reduction). This leaves a gap that doesn’t fully reflect our strategic positions and the valuation differences as we approach later rounds. I believe that as the next proposer in round 5, I can craft an offer that better secures an outcome more favorable to my position while still considering the urgency of settlement. With that in mind, I must respectfully reject your proposal. Looking forward to our continued negotiations!""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in Round 5 the inflation hits us even harder – my money now counts for 80% of its face value, and yours for just 60%. To account for that, I’m proposing a division where I take $400,000 (effectively $320,000) and you receive $600,000 (effectively $360,000). I believe this offer recognizes the steeper penalty you face as rounds progress and avoids further losses for us both. I hope we can settle here before the numbers drop any further.""}"
