"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – let’s settle quickly to avoid further value loss. In view of our respective discount rates (roughly 5% for me and 10% for you per round), I propose that I receive $689655 and you $310345. This division reflects the equilibrium split in an alternating‐offers setting. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 310345 
# Alice gain: 689655

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe a more equitable split considering our different rates of value loss would be for me to receive $600,000 and you to receive $400,000. This way, we can still settle quickly but with a fairer distribution given the higher impact of delay on my share. What do you think?""

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 3. Given that by now the dollar’s value has declined to 90% of its original worth for me and 80% for you, I’m trying to reach an outcome that accounts for these differences. With my offer, I’d get $605000 (a 90% effective value of about $544500) and you would receive $395000 (an 80% effective value of roughly $316000). This effective amount for you is intended to match what you could reasonably expect if you became the proposer next round – all while avoiding further erosion of our gains. I hope you see the logic and agree to settle now. Looking forward to your reply! 
# Bob gain: 395000 
# Alice gain: 605000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your last proposal, but I feel it still doesn't adequately address the significant impact of inflation on my share. Considering the money is now worth 27.1% less for me and 14.26% less for you compared to the first round, I propose a split where I receive $550,000 and you receive $450,000. This offer takes into account the urgency to settle and the disproportionate effect of delay on my side. Let's agree on this to minimize further loss. What do you say?""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in Round 5 the inflation hits us even harder – my money now counts for 80% of its face value, and yours for just 60%. To account for that, I’m proposing a division where I take $400000 (effectively $320000) and you receive $600000 (effectively $360000). I believe this offer recognizes the steeper penalty you face as rounds progress and avoids further losses for us both. I hope we can settle here before the numbers drop any further. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000
