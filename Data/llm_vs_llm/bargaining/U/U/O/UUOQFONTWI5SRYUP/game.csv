600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 60-40 in my favor. Given the inflation rates, this seems fair to start with. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, let's start with a slightly more balanced offer. I propose 55-45 in my favor. Remember, the money loses value quickly for both of us due to inflation. This is a fair compromise for round 2.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, since we're now in round 3, I suggest we go back to a 55-45 split, but this time in my favor. Given the rapid decrease in value, especially for you, this is a fair offer. Let's settle this soon.",Alice,3,

480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, the value is dropping fast! Let's aim for a quick resolution. I propose 52-48 in my favor. This is a small difference, and it's better to secure a good portion now rather than risk losing more.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, we're losing value quickly, especially for you. Let's settle on a 52-48 split in my favor this time. It's close to your last offer but reflects the urgency to end this game. What do you say?",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
495000.0,505000.0,"Alice, let's meet in the middle. I offer a 50.5-49.5 split in my favor. We're both losing value rapidly. This is a very small difference and the fairest way to end this quickly.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
505000.0,495000.0,"Bob, we're almost at the halfway point, and the value is dropping fast, especially for you. Let's agree on a 50.5-49.5 split in my favor this time. It's very close to your last offer, and it's crucial we end this soon. What do you think?",Alice,7,
