"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

* Alice is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for herself
* If I reject, we go to next round where:
  * My next offer will be worth 20% less to me
  * Her next offer will only be worth 5% less to her
  * I can make the next proposal
* Since my inflation rate is much higher (20% vs 5%), delaying is more costly for me
* $400,000 right now is better than a larger nominal amount that's worth less due to high inflation for me
* While not a 50-50 split, this is a reasonable first offer given my weaker negotiating position
