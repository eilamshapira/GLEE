"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an initial offer that's fair but also acknowledges that I want a good outcome for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which gives us each $5,000. This is a fair division that treats us both equally."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Bob rejected a fair 50-50 split and then offered me a significantly lower amount, I'll adjust my offer but still try to be reasonable.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm proposing that I get $4,500 and Bob gets $5,500. I understand Bob wants more than an even split, and I'm willing to compromise. This gives Bob a majority of the funds while still providing me with a fair portion."
