Although not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in round 4 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The value of the money decreases significantly with each round for me (Alice). Waiting any longer will only result in a smaller share of a shrinking pie.
* **Bob's Increasing Leverage:** As the rounds progress, Bob's position strengthens. His losses to inflation are significantly less than mine. This means he's likely to propose even less favorable deals in subsequent rounds.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting guarantees me $475,000 (after accounting for inflation). Rejecting and hoping for a better offer in the next round is a risky gamble.  

While I could aim for a slightly higher amount, the potential gains are outweighed by the risk of ending up with even less if Bob continues to play strategically."
