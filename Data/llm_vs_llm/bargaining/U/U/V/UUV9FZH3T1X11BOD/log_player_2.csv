"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose a fair division that gives me $600,000 and you $400,000. This is a reasonable split that gives us both substantial amounts. Keep in mind that with each round, inflation reduces the value by 10% for me, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a more balanced split of $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. Since inflation is affecting both of us significantly (my money has already lost 27% of its value from the first round), it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a substantial portion while still being fair to me as well."
