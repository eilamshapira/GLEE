"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we both want a larger share of the pie. I'm willing to compromise, but the deal has to be fair to me. This offer reflects the risk I'm taking with each passing round. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer makes sense for a few reasons:

* **Inflation:** My potential gains are decreasing faster than Alice's. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount before it shrinks further.
* **Alice's Position:** Her offer has improved, suggesting she's feeling the pressure of the game's dynamics. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a significantly better offer in later rounds is too risky. There's no guarantee Alice will budge much further, and the value of the money will continue to decrease."
