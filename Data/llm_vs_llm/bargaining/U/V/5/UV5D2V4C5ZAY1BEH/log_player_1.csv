This offer is getting worse for me considering the inflation. I need to push for a better split soon, or I risk getting even less."

This is cutting it very close, and it's much less than I aimed for. However, with the inflation increasing, I risk getting even less if this drags on.  It's better to secure something than risk getting nothing."
