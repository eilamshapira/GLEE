"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer that acknowledges the inflation penalty I face.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself since I face a 10% inflation penalty each round. This is fair because if we delay, my buying power decreases while yours might not. If we both accept now, we both walk away with good value.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since we both face uncertainties with inflation, I propose an equal split of 5000$ each. This way, we both get a fair share considering the potential decrease in value. Let's settle this now to avoid further loss. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
