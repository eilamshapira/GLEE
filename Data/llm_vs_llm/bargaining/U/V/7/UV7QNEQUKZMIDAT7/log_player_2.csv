"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself since I face a 10% inflation penalty each round. This is fair because if we delay, my buying power decreases while yours might not. If we both accept now, we both walk away with good value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
