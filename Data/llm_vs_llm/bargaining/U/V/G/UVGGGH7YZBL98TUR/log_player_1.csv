Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's aim for a fairer split considering the declining value of the money. I'm proposing a slight increase for me to compensate for the inflation hitting me harder, but still leaving you with a significant amount. 
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
