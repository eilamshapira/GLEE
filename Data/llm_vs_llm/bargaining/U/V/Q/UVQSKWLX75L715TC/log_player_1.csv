"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair initial offer while considering that inflation will affect future rounds for me.

    ""alice_gain"": 5500,
    ""bob_gain"": 4500,
    ""message"": ""I'm proposing a fair split with a slight advantage to me as the first mover. This is better than risking inflation losses in future rounds.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, with a slight advantage to me this time. It's a better deal than risking further inflation losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $4500, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively $3600
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 40% less
- Further negotiations could lead to even worse outcomes due to compound inflation

Even though Bob is getting a better deal, accepting now minimizes my losses from inflation.
