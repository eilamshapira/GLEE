"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me think strategically about this. Since Bob's money loses 5% value each round, while mine doesn't depreciate, I have some leverage. However, I don't want to be too aggressive in the first round and risk rejection.

A reasonable first offer would be to give myself a bit more than half, but not too much to provoke an immediate rejection.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this split because while it gives me the larger share, it still leaves Bob with a substantial amount. If Bob rejects this, their money will be worth less in the next round, which works in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000
2. For Bob, the $600,000 is actually worth $570,000 (95% of original value) due to 5% inflation
3. If I reject, we go to round 3 where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 5% less
   - I still have many rounds left
   - My money maintains its value

Since Bob's money keeps losing value while mine doesn't, I have an advantage by waiting. I can likely get a better deal in later rounds as Bob's position weakens due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now that we're in round 3, Bob's money is worth even less (90.25% of original value). I can use this to my advantage, but still need to make an offer that Bob might accept to avoid dragging this out too long.

Since Bob's previous offer showed they want a larger share, I'll adjust my offer slightly from my first one, but still maintain an advantage for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

This offer gives Bob $350,000, which, even after the current 9.75% inflation, is still worth about $316,625 to them. If they reject this and we continue to later rounds, their money will be worth even less, so this should be an incentive for them to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Bob is offering me $450,000 and keeping $550,000
2. For Bob, the $550,000 is actually worth about $471,570 (85.74% of original value) due to 14.26% inflation
3. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make an offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 5% less
   - We still have 8 rounds left
   - My money maintains its value

Bob is moving in the right direction (offering me more than last time), but given the strong inflation effect and my stronger negotiating position, I believe I can get a better deal by waiting. The inflation effect is becoming more significant with each round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now we're in round 5, and Bob's money has lost about 19% of its value (worth about 81% of original). Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate by increasing my share in their last offer. Given the increasing inflation pressure on Bob's side and the fact that we're nearing the halfway point of our 12 rounds, I'll make a stronger offer in my favor but one that might still be acceptable to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

This offer gives Bob $300,000, which after current inflation is worth about $243,000 to them. If they reject this and we continue further, their money will be worth even less, making this a reasonable point to accept. They've shown they're willing to move up to offering me $450,000, so this counteroffer, while aggressive, isn't completely unreasonable given the inflationary pressure they're under."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split: $500,000 each
2. For Bob, their $500,000 is actually worth about $387,000 (77.38% of original value) due to 22.62% inflation
3. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make an offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 5% less
   - We still have 6 rounds left
   - My money maintains its value

Bob continues to improve their offers (from 400k → 450k → 500k for me), showing they're feeling the pressure of inflation. However, the inflation effect is becoming quite significant now, and I still have a strong negotiating position. With 6 rounds left and Bob's money continuing to lose value, I believe I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","We're now in round 7, and Bob's money has lost about 27% of its value (worth about 73% of original). Bob has been steadily increasing their offers to me (showing they understand their weakening position), and we're now past the halfway point of our 12 rounds. Let me make a strategic offer that reflects this situation.

{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}

This offer gives Bob $250,000, which after current inflation is worth about $182,500 to them. This might seem aggressive, but consider:
1. Bob has shown willingness to negotiate upward
2. Their money is rapidly losing value
3. We only have 5 rounds left after this
4. If they reject and we continue further, their position only weakens
5. They need to weigh this against the risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement

Given these factors, this offer, while strongly in my favor, presents a reasonable point for Bob to accept rather than risk further value loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Bob is offering me $550,000 and taking $450,000
2. For Bob, their $450,000 is actually worth about $314,000 (69.83% of original value) due to 30.17% inflation
3. If I reject:
   - Next round I can make an offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 5% less
   - We still have 4 rounds left
   - My money maintains its value

Bob continues to improve their offers (from 400k → 450k → 500k → 550k for me), showing they clearly understand their weakening position. However:
1. We're entering the final third of negotiations (only 4 rounds left)
2. The inflation effect is very significant now
3. I have a much stronger position as my money retains value
4. Bob's previous willingness to increase offers suggests they have more room to move

Given these factors, I believe I can still get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","We're now in round 9, with only 3 rounds remaining after this. Bob's money has lost about 35% of its value, and they've shown steady willingness to increase my share (last offering me 550k). The time pressure is building, but it affects Bob more than me due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

This offer gives Bob $200,000, which after current inflation is worth about $130,000 to them. While this is an aggressive offer, I believe it's strategically sound because:

1. We're very close to the end (only 3 rounds left)
2. Bob has consistently moved up in their offers, showing they understand their weakening position
3. The alternative for Bob is:
   - Reject and make a counter-offer that will be worth even less to them
   - Risk getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement
4. Bob's last offer of 550k to me shows they're willing to accept a less than equal split

The time pressure and inflation effects should make this offer more palatable to Bob than it would have been in earlier rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this critical situation:
1. Bob is offering me $600,000 and taking $400,000
2. For Bob, their $400,000 is worth only about $252,000 (63.02% of original value) due to 36.98% inflation
3. If I reject:
   - Only 2 rounds remain
   - Bob's money will be worth another 5% less
   - Both of us get nothing if we don't agree by round 12
   - My money maintains its value

While Bob continues to increase their offers (now at 600k for me), we're in a very critical phase:
1. The game ends in 2 rounds if we don't agree
2. I have one more chance to make an offer after this
3. The risk of both getting nothing is becoming real

However, given that I still have one more chance to make an offer, and Bob has consistently shown willingness to increase my share, I believe I can still get a better deal. The threat of getting nothing will be even more pressing in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","We're now in round 11 - the second to last round. This is an extremely critical moment:
1. Bob's money has lost about 41% of its value
2. If we don't reach agreement in this round or the next, we both get nothing
3. Bob has shown willingness to give me up to 600k in their last offer

Given the extreme time pressure and the fact that Bob must be very aware of the risk of getting nothing, I'll make an offer that's strong but not as aggressive as my last one.

{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}

I'm reducing my demand from 800k to 750k because:
1. This is our second-to-last chance to make a deal
2. Getting nothing is a real possibility if we don't agree
3. This gives Bob $250,000 (worth about $147,500 to them after inflation)
4. This is still better for me than Bob's last offer of 600k
5. For Bob, accepting this is better than risking getting nothing
6. If Bob rejects, they only have one last chance to make a deal, with their money worth even less

This offer balances my strong negotiating position with the need to actually reach an agreement before we both get nothing."
