"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering inflation, I'll take a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept this offer, my $40 would be worth 20% less than its original value, which means I'd effectively get $32.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less with each round, and this is the third round, the money I gain would be worth 20% * 2 = 40% less than its original value (20% less in round 2 and another 20% less in round 3, but compounded: 1 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64, so 36% less, I will use 40% for simplicity, but keep in mind the actual decrease is 36%). 

To maximize my gain, I'll offer Bob a bit less than before.

{""alice_gain"": 45, 
""bob_gain"": 55, 
""message"": ""Let's settle this before inflation reduces my share further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting you harder, I'll take more. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth 48.8% less than its original value, if I accept this offer, my $35 would be worth approximately $18.

Considering this significant decrease in value, I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risking further inflation.
