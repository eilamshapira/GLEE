Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair offer, as it gives Bob a significant portion of the money while still leaving me with the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. Given Bob's last offer, I believe this is a reasonable compromise that still gives him a decent portion of the money."
