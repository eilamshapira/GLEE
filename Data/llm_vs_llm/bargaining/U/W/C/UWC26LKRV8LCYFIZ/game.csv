550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair division that accounts for the 20% inflation penalty I'll face if we go to another round. If we reject each other's offers, we both lose value. This split gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging my first-mover position.",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is disadvantaged, and we both walk away with a reasonable amount. Accept my offer, and we can both be happy with the outcome.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I need to account for the 20% inflation penalty I'm facing - money is worth significantly less to me now than it was in round 1. This 60/40 split is actually fair when you consider that my $600000 is effectively worth only $480000 to me due to the inflation. You're not facing any inflation penalty, so your $400000 retains full value. This is a fair adjustment given our different circumstances.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I think this split is fair given that I'm not facing any inflation penalty and your share is still substantial. Let's settle on this and avoid further rounds.",Bob,4,
