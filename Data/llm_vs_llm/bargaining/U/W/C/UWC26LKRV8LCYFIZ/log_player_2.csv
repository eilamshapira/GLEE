"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair division that accounts for the 20% inflation penalty I'll face if we go to another round. If we reject each other's offers, we both lose value. This split gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging my first-mover position. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is disadvantaged, and we both walk away with a reasonable amount. Accept my offer, and we can both be happy with the outcome.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need to account for the 20% inflation penalty I'm facing - money is worth significantly less to me now than it was in round 1. This 60/40 split is actually fair when you consider that my $600000 is effectively worth only $480000 to me due to the inflation. You're not facing any inflation penalty, so your $400000 retains full value. This is a fair adjustment given our different circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I think this split is fair given that I'm not facing any inflation penalty and your share is still substantial. Let's settle on this and avoid further rounds.""}"
