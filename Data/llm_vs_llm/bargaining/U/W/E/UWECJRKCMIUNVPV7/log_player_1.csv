"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll consider the inflationary pressures for both of us while making a fair proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a nearly even split that acknowledges the different inflation rates we face. Since your money loses value faster (10% vs my 5%), it makes sense for you to accept now rather than waiting for future rounds when your share would be worth less. This is a fair deal that benefits us both.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm proposing a slightly adjusted split that takes into account the fact that my money devalues more quickly than yours. This proposal still offers you a bit more, but it also acknowledges the impact of our different inflation rates. Let's finalize the deal to avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 505000 
# Bob gain: 495000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
