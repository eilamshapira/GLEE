"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a nearly even split that acknowledges the different inflation rates we face. Since your money loses value faster (10% vs my 5%), it makes sense for you to accept now rather than waiting for future rounds when your share would be worth less. This is a fair deal that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 495000, ""alice_gain"": 505000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing a slightly adjusted split that takes into account the fact that my money devalues more quickly than yours. This proposal still offers you a bit more, but it also acknowledges the impact of our different inflation rates. Let's finalize the deal to avoid further devaluation.""}"
