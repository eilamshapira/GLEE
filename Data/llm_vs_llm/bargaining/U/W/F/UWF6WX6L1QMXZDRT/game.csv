550000.0,450000.0,I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount without risking depreciation in future rounds.,Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, let's be realistic. I'm proposing I take 60% and you take 40%.  It's still a good deal for you before inflation eats away more of our potential earnings. Accept now, and we both win.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, let's be rational. With 40% inflation already affecting our gains, we should agree to a 50-50 split now. This way we both get $400000 in real value, which is better than risking another round of depreciation. It's perfectly fair and optimal for both of us.",Alice,3,
