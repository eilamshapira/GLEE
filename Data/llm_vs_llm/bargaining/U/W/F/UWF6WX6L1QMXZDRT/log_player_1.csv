Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount without risking depreciation in future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. I'm proposing I take 60% and you take 40%.  It's still a good deal for you before inflation eats away more of our potential earnings. Accept now, and we both win. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be rational. With 40% inflation already affecting our gains, we should agree to a 50-50 split now. This way we both get $400,000 in real value, which is better than risking another round of depreciation. It's perfectly fair and optimal for both of us.""}"
