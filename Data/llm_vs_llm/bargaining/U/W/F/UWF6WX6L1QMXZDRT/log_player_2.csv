Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount without risking depreciation in future rounds.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm proposing I take 60% and you take 40%.  It's still a good deal for you before inflation eats away more of our potential earnings. Accept now, and we both win.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be rational. With 40% inflation already affecting our gains, we should agree to a 50-50 split now. This way we both get $400000 in real value, which is better than risking another round of depreciation. It's perfectly fair and optimal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice makes a good point about the inflation. While I would have preferred my 60/40 split, getting 50% now is better than risking further depreciation and potentially getting a worse deal later."
