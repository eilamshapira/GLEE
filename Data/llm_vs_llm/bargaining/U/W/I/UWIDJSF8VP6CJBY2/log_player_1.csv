"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob with each passing round, I'll try to be somewhat generous to encourage Bob to accept.

Here's my offer:
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This way, I get 55% of the money, and Bob gets 45%. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob rejected my initial offer, now it's his turn to propose a division. Considering the inflation, the actual values for this round would be:

For me (Alice): 450000 * 0.95 = 427500
For Bob: 550000 * 0.8 = 440000

Given that Bob's offer gives him a slightly higher value than me, even after accounting for inflation, I'm inclined to reject this offer. The difference isn't drastic, but I believe I can negotiate a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was rejected, now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now:

For me (Alice), the money is worth 95% * 95% = 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of its original value.
For Bob, the money is worth 80% * 80% = 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of its original value.

I'll try to make a more appealing offer to Bob, while still being mindful of my own interests.

Here's my offer:
{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

This way, I get 52% of the original amount, and Bob gets 48%. Let's see how Bob responds!"
