"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both lose value in future rounds, and you lose less than I do to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the inflation rates, my offer of 55-45 in my favor accounts for the fact that I lose value slower than you do. This split is more equitable considering our future losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob is offering me $4500, but due to 20% inflation, it's only worth $3600 to me now
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth even less
3. Bob's offer accounts for the differential inflation rates
4. The longer we negotiate, the worse it gets for me due to higher inflation rate
