"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Given the asymmetric inflation rates, I should consider that the money loses value faster for me than for Bob over multiple rounds.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I believe this offer is more fair. You lose more value than me with each passing round, so let's settle now. 
# Alice gain: 43 
# Bob gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be completely fair and split this evenly. At this point, I've already lost 20% of my value and you've lost 10%. If we keep going, we both lose more. This is a fair 50-50 split that benefits us both more than continuing to negotiate.""}"
