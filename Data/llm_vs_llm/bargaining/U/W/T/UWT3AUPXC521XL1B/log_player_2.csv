Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. If we go to another round, we both lose value - I lose 10% and you lose 5%. Let's settle now and both walk away with good value.

# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 57, 
""alice_gain"": 43, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I believe this offer is more fair. You lose more value than me with each passing round, so let's settle now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be completely fair and split this evenly. At this point, I've already lost 20% of my value and you've lost 10%. If we keep going, we both lose more. This is a fair 50-50 split that benefits us both more than continuing to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
