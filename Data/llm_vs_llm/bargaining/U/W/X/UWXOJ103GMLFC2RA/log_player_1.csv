Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a larger share, but with inflation hitting me hard, I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. How about I take $5500 and you take $4500? This accounts for the declining value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
