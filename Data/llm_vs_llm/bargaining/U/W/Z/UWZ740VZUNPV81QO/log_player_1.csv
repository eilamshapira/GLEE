"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make it equal and fair for both of us. We both get half! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $500,000, but it's worth 20% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $500,000 * 0.8 = $400,000.

Since Bob's offer gives us an equal split, and considering the significant difference in inflation rates between us, I think this is a reasonable offer.
