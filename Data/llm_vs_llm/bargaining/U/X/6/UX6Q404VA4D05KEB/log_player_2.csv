"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's end early 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing to take 60% ($6000) while giving me 40% ($4000). While this isn't an even split, it's not terribly unfair. However, since this is just the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while maintaining a constructive negotiation approach.
