"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the 50-50 split offer from Alice, let me consider whether to accept or reject.

If I accept now, I get $500,000 immediately.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the $1,000,000 pot is effectively worth only $800,000 to me. Even if I could get a much better split in round 2, I need to factor in this significant loss in value.

Since this is a fair initial offer and the inflation penalty is substantial, it makes economic sense to accept now rather than risk further devaluation of my share.
