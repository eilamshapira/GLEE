"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 20.83, ""bob_gain"": 79.17, ""message"": ""Hi Bob—I propose we split the $100 so that I take $20.83 and you take $79.17. If you reject, you’ll be in the proposer’s seat next round, but remember that waiting costs: for me the value drops by 20% each round and for you by 5%. This offer gives you essentially what you’d expect from waiting, so I believe it’s a fair and timely deal. What do you say?""}"
