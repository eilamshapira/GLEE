"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob—I propose we split the $100 so that I take $20.83 and you take $79.17. If you reject, you’ll be in the proposer’s seat next round, but remember that waiting costs: for me the value drops by 20% each round and for you by 5%. This offer gives you essentially what you’d expect from waiting, so I believe it’s a fair and timely deal. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 79.17 
# Alice gain: 20.83 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Current offer: I get $79.17, Alice gets $20.83

2. If I reject:
- Next round I can make an offer
- However, the money will be worth 5% less to me
- For Alice, it will be worth 20% less
- $100 * 0.95 = $95 total value for me next round
- $100 * 0.80 = $80 total value for Alice next round

3. Alice's offer is quite generous, giving me nearly 80% of the pot
- If I reject and make a new offer, I might get a slightly larger percentage
- But due to the 5% depreciation, I would need to get about 83.3% of the pot just to match the current offer's value
- Alice would be less likely to accept such a high demand

4. This is a good first offer that accounts for our different depreciation rates
