4000.0,6000.0,"Since the money loses 5% of its value each round for you but not for me, waiting costs you more. I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor to account for this asymmetry while still giving you a substantial share. This is better for you than rejecting and getting less value in the next round.",Bob,2,
