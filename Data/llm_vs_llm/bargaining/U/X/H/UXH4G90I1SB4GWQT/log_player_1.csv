Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000,""bob_gain"": 5000,""message"": ""Let's split it evenly for a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since the money loses 5% of its value each round for you but not for me, waiting costs you more. I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor to account for this asymmetry while still giving you a substantial share. This is better for you than rejecting and getting less value in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
