"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly for a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is fair for me. 

Given the inflation conditions, money retains 100% of its value for me in each round, while for Alice it loses 5% of its value each round. This means that I don't lose anything by rejecting and moving to the next round, while Alice has an incentive to reach an agreement sooner.

Since I can make a counter-offer in the next round without any penalty to myself, I should reject this initial even split and propose a division that takes the inflation asymmetry into account.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make an offer that reflects our different positions regarding inflation while still being reasonably fair.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Since the money loses 5% of its value each round for you but not for me, waiting costs you more. I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor to account for this asymmetry while still giving you a substantial share. This is better for you than rejecting and getting less value in the next round.""}"
