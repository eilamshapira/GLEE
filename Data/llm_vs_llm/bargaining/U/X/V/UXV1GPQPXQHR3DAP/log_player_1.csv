"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn now, let's make it more even, but I'll take a bit more since I'm making the counteroffer. Accept? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The 45$ with 20% inflation (worth 36$) is still better than risking further rounds with more inflation, and it's a relatively fair split. Better to secure this deal now than risk getting less in future rounds."
