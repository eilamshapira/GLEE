60.0,40.0,I propose a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is still a fair offer considering you get a substantial portion.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"My turn now, a 55-45 split is more reasonable, considering we're just starting and there's still room for negotiation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
52.0,48.0,Let's be practical - we're both losing money to inflation. I'm offering a nearly equal split at 52-48. This is fair and we should agree now before the value decreases further.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Inflation is indeed eating into our potential gains, so let's finalize this. A 52-48 split in my favor seems like a fair compromise, considering we're already in the fourth round.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
