"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer gives me $400,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation for me:
   * Any amount in the next round will be worth 20% less to me
   * $1M in next round is only worth $800,000 to me
   * Even if I got all $1M next round, it would only be worth $800,000

Since $400,000 now is worth more than what I could reasonably expect to get in the next round (considering inflation and the need to make an acceptable offer to Alice), I should accept this offer.
