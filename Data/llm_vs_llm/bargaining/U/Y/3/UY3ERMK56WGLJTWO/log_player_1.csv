Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 20, ""bob_gain"": 80, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I take $20 and you get $80. If you hold out for your turn in round 2, youâ€™ll be facing a 20% devaluation, so your best alternative as the proposer would net you, at most, an effective $80. I believe this split reflects those incentives fairly. Looking forward to your acceptance!""}"
