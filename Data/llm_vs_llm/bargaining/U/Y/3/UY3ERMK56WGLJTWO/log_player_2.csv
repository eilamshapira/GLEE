"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I take $20 and you get $80. If you hold out for your turn in round 2, youâ€™ll be facing a 20% devaluation, so your best alternative as the proposer would net you, at most, an effective $80. I believe this split reflects those incentives fairly. Looking forward to your acceptance! 
# Bob gain: 80 
# Alice gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
