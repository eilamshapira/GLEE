Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 55-45 split in my favor. This compensates for the inflation risk I'm taking, while still giving you a substantial portion. Let's avoid further rounds where we both lose value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
