"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money. I'll take $60, you get $40. It's a good deal for both of us to avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is asking for a 60-40 split in her favor, which seems a bit unfair since we're starting from equal positions. With inflation affecting my share by 5% each round, I could lose value by waiting, but I still think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

If I reject now, I can propose a more equitable split in round 2, where my $40 would only be worth $38 due to inflation, but I could ask for more to compensate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, acknowledging the inflation risk for both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 55-45 split in my favor. This compensates for the inflation risk I'm taking, while still giving you a substantial portion. Let's avoid further rounds where we both lose value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the risk you're taking with inflation, but my initial offer was more than fair. Let's settle this now. I'll take $55, and you take $45.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has reduced her demand from $60 to $55, showing some willingness to compromise
2. My $45 would be worth about $40.61 (due to 9.75% inflation) if I accept now
3. If I reject and we continue:
   - Inflation will keep reducing the value for me
   - Interestingly, Alice seems to be affected by even higher inflation (36%)
   - Her $55 is actually worth much less to her than it was in round 1

Given that Alice is facing significantly higher inflation than I am (36% vs 9.75%), and she's made a reasonable compromise, I think I should accept this offer. Further negotiations might lead to both of us losing more value.
