"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate whether to accept Alice's offer or reject it and make a counteroffer.

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000 total, which is 40% of the pot. While this isn't an even split, it's a reasonably substantial amount.

Since there's no inflation for me (0% less each round), I don't lose any value by continuing to negotiate. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which might give me some leverage in future rounds.

I think I can propose a more favorable split if I reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a slightly more balanced split while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split of the $10,000, which I believe is fair for both of us. This gives us each $5,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this situation carefully. Alice has increased her offer to me from $4,000 to $4,500, which is a positive move in my direction.

Important context:
- Alice is now experiencing 36% inflation on her gains
- I still have 0% inflation on my gains
- If we continue to negotiate, Alice's inflation will likely increase further

Given that Alice is now experiencing significant inflation (36%), her $5,500 is effectively worth only about $3,520 to her ($5,500 Ã— 0.64). This puts her at a disadvantage in prolonged negotiations.

She's moving in my direction with the offer, and given her inflation penalty, this might be close to optimal for both of us. If I reject and we go another round, her position weakens further due to inflation.
