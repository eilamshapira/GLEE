Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since we're now dealing with $8000 (after 20% inflation), I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split where we each get $4000. This is equivalent to a 5000-5000 split of the original amount. An equal split seems fairest to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
