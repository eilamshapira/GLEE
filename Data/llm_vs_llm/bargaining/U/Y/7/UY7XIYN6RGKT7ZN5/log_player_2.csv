"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice is proposing a split where she gets $6000 and I get $4000. This isn't an equal split, and since this is the first round, I believe I can make a counter-offer in the next round.

If I reject this offer, the total money will decrease by 20% to $8000 in the next round, but I could propose a more favorable split. Since we're at the beginning of the game, I'll try to negotiate for a better outcome.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging the decreased value due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since we're now dealing with $8000 (after 20% inflation), I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split where we each get $4000. This is equivalent to a 5000-5000 split of the original amount. An equal split seems fairest to both of us.""}"
