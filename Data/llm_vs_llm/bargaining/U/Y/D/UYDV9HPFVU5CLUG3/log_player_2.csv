"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, fair for both 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

In this first round, Alice offers a 50-50 split ($5000 each).
If I reject:
- I can make a counter-offer next round
- But the money will be worth 20% less to me
- $5000 next round would only be worth $4000 to me
- Even if I managed to get more next round, the inflation penalty would likely offset the gains

A 50-50 split is fair, and waiting would only decrease the value for me due to inflation. Better to take a fair deal now than risk getting less value later.
