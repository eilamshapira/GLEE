"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, in the next round the money will be worth less to me
4. 4000$ now is better than 4200$ in the next round (which would be worth 3990$ to me after 5% inflation)
5. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of losing value through inflation makes this a decent offer
