"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4000 and keeping $6000 for herself
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
   * My money will be worth 5% less
   * Her money will be worth 10% less
   * I get to make the next proposal

A 5% reduction means if I propose in the next round, the maximum value I could get would be $9,500 (for me) and the remaining amount would be worth even less for Alice due to her 10% penalty.

While the split isn't exactly 50-50, $4000 is a reasonable offer, and the risk of further devaluation makes accepting now more attractive than continuing negotiation.
