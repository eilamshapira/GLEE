"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 2. I'll try to be reasonable while accounting for the rapidly decreasing value of the money to both of us.

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 560000,
  ""alice_gain"": 440000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm offering Alice $440,000.  Given her devaluation rate, this should still seem attractive to her in round 2, while securing a slightly larger portion for myself to account for my own devaluation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 4, taking into account the increasing devaluation and Alice's previous offers:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000
}
```

Reasoning: I'm increasing my share, but still leaving a significant portion for Alice. At this point, I estimate accepting anything less than this would not make sense due to the devaluation. I am hoping the higher amount will convince Alice to accept, as her money is losing value faster than mine."
