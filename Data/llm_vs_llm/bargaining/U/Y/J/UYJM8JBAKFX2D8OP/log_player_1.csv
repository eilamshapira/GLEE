"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the 10% inflation penalty Bob faces each round. Since I want to be fair but also maximize my gain, I'll make a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose $60 for me and $40 for Bob. This is a fair starting offer that gives Bob a good portion while acknowledging my position as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob offers me $55 and keeps $45
2. For me, $55 is worth exactly $55
3. For Bob, his $45 is actually worth $40.50 due to 10% inflation
4. If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer, but Bob's value will decrease further
5. $55 is a reasonable offer for me, and better than risking a prolonged negotiation
