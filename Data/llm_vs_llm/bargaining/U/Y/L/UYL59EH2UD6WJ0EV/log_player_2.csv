"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I'll take $55 and you'll get $45 from the $100. Since the money's value drops by 5% for me each round, I hope you'll see the benefit of an immediate agreement. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer gives me $45 and the money's value drops by 10% for me each round, I should consider the potential loss if I don't accept. 

However, considering it's the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counteroffer later, I might want to try to get a better deal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, now it's my turn to make a proposal. Considering the 10% inflation effect on me, I want to make a reasonable offer to Alice while also taking into account the potential loss of value in the next round.

My offer is to take $50 for myself and give $50 to Alice. This way, we both get an equal share, and I'm hoping Alice will see the fairness in this proposal.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, let's split it 50-50. It's a fair deal, and we both avoid further devaluation.""}"
