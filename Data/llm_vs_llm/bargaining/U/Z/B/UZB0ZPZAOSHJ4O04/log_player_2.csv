"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48.72 
# Alice gain: 51.28 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $48.72 while keeping $51.28 for herself. It's slightly in her favor, but not by much.

If I reject, I get to make a counter-offer in round 2, but the total amount will be worth 5% less, meaning we'd only be dividing $95. Even if I asked for a perfect 50/50 split in round 2, I'd get $47.50, which is less than the $48.72 I'm being offered now.

Since this offer is close to fair and rejecting would likely lead to me getting less due to the 5% inflation penalty, I'll accept.
