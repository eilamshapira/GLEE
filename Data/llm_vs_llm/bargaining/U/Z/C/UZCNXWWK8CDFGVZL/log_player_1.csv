"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's reverse the roles, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a fair trade, wouldn't you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 20% inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, my $4000 would be worth $4000 * 0.8 = $3200 to me.

I think I can do better than that. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Due to the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% * 2 = 40% less than in the first round (20% less in Round 1 and another 20% less in Round 2, which is equivalent to 40% less in total, or 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64).

To make up for this loss, I'll try to get a bit more.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is eating away at my share, so I need a bit more. Let's settle this!""
}
```"
