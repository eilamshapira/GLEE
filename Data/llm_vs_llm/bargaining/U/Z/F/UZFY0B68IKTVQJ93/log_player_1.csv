"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the higher inflation penalty I face. Since my money loses value faster (10% vs 5% per round), I should aim for a reasonable first offer that Bob would likely accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose this split because it's close to 50-50 while giving me a slight advantage to compensate for my higher inflation penalty. It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting rather than moving to the next round where both of us would lose value due to inflation."
