"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The current offer gives me $4,800 out of $10,000 (48%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less next round for me
4. After inflation, $10,000 would be worth $9,500 to me next round
5. To get a better deal, I'd need to secure more than $4,800 after inflation
6. Alice's inflation is even higher at 10%, so she might be more willing to accept a reasonable offer now

While I could try to negotiate for more, $4,800 is a decent offer considering the inflation penalty for continuing. The risk of losing value through inflation might outweigh the potential gain from negotiation.
