"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer is 50$ for me
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 5% less for me (95$ total value)
   - The money will be worth 10% less for Alice (90$ total value)
   - I could potentially get more, but Alice might reject

The 50-50 split is fair, and avoiding inflation losses is a smart move. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of further devaluation and potential rejection makes the current offer reasonable.
