"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is my initial offer. I am keeping most of the money, but I am giving Bob a small portion to incentivize him to accept. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm still aiming for a large portion of the money, but I'm increasing Bob's share slightly to make it more appealing. The inflation factor is starting to become a concern, so I need to find a balance between securing a good amount for myself and avoiding a situation where we both get nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm starting to get nervous about inflation, so I'm willing to give Bob a larger share this time.  However, I'm still trying to secure a significant amount for myself."
