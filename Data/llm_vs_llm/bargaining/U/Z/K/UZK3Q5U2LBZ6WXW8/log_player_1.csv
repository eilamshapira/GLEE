"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on a backwards‐induction reasoning (treating the negotiation as a finite‐horizon alternating‐offers game where each round the money is “discounted” by 5% for you (Alice) and 10% for Bob), an equilibrium analysis gives the following outcome if both sides act rationally. (All amounts are in nominal dollars; note that waiting reduces the effective value.) 

In the final (12th) round Bob would be able to secure nearly all of the $10,000 (offering you nearly nothing), so working backward we require that in each earlier round the proposer gives the other just enough so that the responder’s “discounted‐by–waiting” continuation value is matched. (For example, in round 2 when Bob would be proposing, Alice’s continuation value from waiting until round 3 is roughly $3,745 in nominal dollars—but because she would get that money one round later (with a 5% reduction) her value today would be about $3,557. In round 1 (with no discount yet for either party) you, as proposer, must offer Bob an amount that—if he waited until round 2 where he could secure about $6,443 nominal dollars but then face a 10% delay discount—yields about $5,798 in today’s dollars.) 

The successive calculations (rounded at each step for clarity) lead us to the equilibrium offer in round 1 as follows:
 • Bob must receive about $5,798.58, 
 • and you keep about $4,201.42.

Thus, my round‑1 offer is:

{""alice_gain"": 4201.42, ""bob_gain"": 5798.58} 

You can now relay this offer to Bob."
