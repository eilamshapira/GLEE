"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5798.58 
# Alice gain: 4201.42 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. This is a fairly reasonable split, with me getting about 58% and Alice getting 42%
2. If I reject, inflation will reduce the value of money by 10% for me and 5% for Alice
3. Even if I make a better proposal next round, the inflation will eat into my gains
4. The split is already in my favor
5. Getting a guaranteed $5,798.58 is better than risking further negotiations with inflation
