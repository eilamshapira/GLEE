"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4737 
# Alice gain: 5263 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4,737 (47.37% of the total)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   * The money will be worth 10% less to me
   * $4,737 now > ($10,000 × 0.9) × any split in next round

The offer is reasonably fair, close to a 50-50 split. While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes this risky. A 10% reduction would mean even a better split in the next round might give me less real value.
