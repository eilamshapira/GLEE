"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Given that I'm Alice and I'm starting the negotiation, I'll propose a fair division considering our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I suggest this division because we both face different inflation penalties in future rounds. Since your money loses value faster (10% per round) than mine (5% per round), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. This split gives you a substantial portion while recognizing that I face a slightly lower inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer to Bob, taking into account the increasing inflation pressure on both of us, especially for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 5300, ""bob_gain"": 4700}

I'm adjusting my offer to be more favorable to Bob than my initial proposal. With each passing round, both of us are losing value due to inflation (you at 10% per round, me at 5% per round). This is a reasonable compromise that gives us both a substantial portion of the money, and it would be beneficial to reach an agreement soon rather than continue negotiations while our potential gains decrease."
