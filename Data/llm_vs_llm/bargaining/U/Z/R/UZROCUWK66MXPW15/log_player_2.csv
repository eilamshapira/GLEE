"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives her a higher amount, I need to consider the impact of inflation on future rounds. With a 10% inflation for me compared to 5% for Alice, waiting for a better deal could be risky.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation risk while seeking a more balanced split.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even 50-50 split. This is fair to both of us, and considering the asymmetric inflation rates (10% for me vs 5% for you), reaching an agreement sooner benefits us both."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer slightly, but I still need to consider the increasing inflation impact. At this point, my 10% inflation per round has compounded to 19%, while Alice's is at 9.75%. If we continue to later rounds, my position will weaken faster than Alice's.
