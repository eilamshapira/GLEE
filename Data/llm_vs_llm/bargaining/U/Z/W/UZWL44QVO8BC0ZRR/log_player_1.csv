"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor as I'm making the first move and taking initiative in these negotiations.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal split. This way, both of us get a fair share. Considering inflation, dragging this negotiation further might not be beneficial for either of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob offers me $5000, which is less than my initial proposal but still a significant amount
2. For me, there's no inflation effect, so my $5000 retains full value
3. For Bob, his $5000 is actually worth 20% less due to inflation
4. If I reject and make another offer, Bob's portion will be worth even less to him in the next round
5. This might make Bob more likely to accept a less favorable deal, but it also risks prolonging the negotiation
6. A guaranteed $5000 now is better than the risk of a longer negotiation
