"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair initial offer considering the inflation penalty that affects me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher share for myself because I'm affected by 5% inflation with each passing round. This means if we go to another round, the money is worth less to me. This split is fair considering that factor.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's keep it simple and split the money evenly. A 50/50 split seems fair to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider that due to inflation, the $50 offered to me is now worth 5% less than it would have been in round 1. Since I'm affected by inflation, this means my $50 would be equivalent to $47.50 in round 1 value.

If I reject, I can make another offer in round 3, but then any money I receive would be worth another 5% less (90.25% of original value). Also, Bob might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation for me.

Given these considerations, I'll accept this offer.
