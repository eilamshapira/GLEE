"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher share for myself because I'm affected by 5% inflation with each passing round. This means if we go to another round, the money is worth less to me. This split is fair considering that factor. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
