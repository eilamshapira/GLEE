550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This gives you a substantial $450000 while acknowledging my position as the first mover.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, let's split this evenly at $500000 each. It's a fair deal for both of us and saves time.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, considering the inflation effect on your side, this split actually makes more sense now. You'll get $400000, and while it's less nominally, we should reach an agreement soon to minimize your inflation impact. This is still a substantial amount for you.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Alice, with the inflation impact considered, I propose you take $550000 and I take $450000. It's less than my initial ask but should be acceptable for both given the circumstances.",Bob,4,
