"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This gives you a substantial $450,000 while acknowledging my position as the first mover.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split this evenly at $500000 each. It's a fair deal for both of us and saves time. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. If I accept Bob's offer, I get $500,000 at full value
2. If I reject:
   - I can make another offer in the next round
   - But Bob's money will be worth even less to him due to inflation
   - My money maintains its value
   - This gives me negotiating leverage in the next round

Since Bob's money is already worth 20% less to him in this round (his $500,000 is effectively worth $400,000 to him), and will be worth even less next round, I have a strong negotiating position. I can likely get a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Bob, considering the inflation effect on your side, this split actually makes more sense now. You'll get $400,000, and while it's less nominally, we should reach an agreement soon to minimize your inflation impact. This is still a substantial amount for you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, with the inflation impact considered, I propose you take $550000 and I take $450000. It's less than my initial ask but should be acceptable for both given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. If I accept:
   - I get $550,000 at full value
   - This is actually better than Bob's previous offer of $500,000

2. If I reject:
   - I can make another offer in next round
   - Bob's money will be worth even less to him (inflation will be even higher)
   - My money maintains its value
   - However, we might risk prolonging negotiations unnecessarily

3. Current situation:
   - Bob's $450,000 is actually worth only about $230,400 to him due to 48.8% inflation
   - He's offering me more than his previous offer
   - This is a reasonable improvement from his perspective

Given that Bob has increased his offer to me, and considering that prolonging the negotiation might lead to unnecessary conflict without substantial gain, I'll accept this offer.
