"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This gives you a substantial $450000 while acknowledging my position as the first mover. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, let's split this evenly at $500,000 each. It's a fair deal for both of us and saves time.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation effect on your side, this split actually makes more sense now. You'll get $400000, and while it's less nominally, we should reach an agreement soon to minimize your inflation impact. This is still a substantial amount for you. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, with the inflation impact considered, I propose you take $550,000 and I take $450,000. It's less than my initial ask but should be acceptable for both given the circumstances.""}"
