"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing, so I need to secure a larger portion for myself in this round than I would have accepted in previous rounds.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob's previous offer of 50/50 suggests he might be aiming for a relatively even split.  
* **Negotiation:** By slightly increasing my share from the previous round (where I aimed for 60), I'm showing willingness to negotiate while still prioritizing my gain in the face of inflation."
