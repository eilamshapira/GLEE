"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me after the first round, the total amount I'm considering is $10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000. However, to make the offer, I'll still use the original $10,000 and consider the devaluation in my decision.

My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept the offer, the $5,000 I gain is worth 19% less, so its value to me is $5,000 * 0.81 = $4,050.

Given that the offer gives us an equal split, and considering the devaluation, I think this is a reasonable offer.
