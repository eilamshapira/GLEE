"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob faces steeper inflation penalties than I do (20% vs 10% per round). This gives me some leverage, as waiting is more costly for him.

{
    ""alice_gain"": 600000,
    ""bob_gain"": 400000,
    ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Consider that if you reject, the money will be worth 20% less to you next round, while only 10% less to me. This is a fair offer given these dynamics.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the depreciation, a 55-45 split seems more balanced. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement before the value drops further. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept now:
   * I get $450,000 at 90% value = $405,000 effective value

2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * Money will be worth 80% for me
   * And 60% for Bob
   * This significant depreciation for both of us makes waiting risky

Since Bob's offer gives me a decent portion at a relatively small depreciation, and waiting would mean significant value loss for both parties, I'll accept the offer.
