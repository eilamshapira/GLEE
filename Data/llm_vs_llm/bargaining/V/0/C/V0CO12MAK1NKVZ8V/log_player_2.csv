"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Consider that if you reject, the money will be worth 20% less to you next round, while only 10% less to me. This is a fair offer given these dynamics. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, let's calculate the potential value of the money in the next round if I reject.

Currently, the total amount is $1,000,000. If I reject, the amount I could potentially get in the next round would be worth 20% less to me, which means it would be worth $800,000 in terms of its value to me. For Alice, it would be worth 10% less, so $900,000 in terms of its value to her.

Given Alice's offer of a 60-40 split in her favor, I would get $400,000. If I reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, I would ideally want to get more than $400,000, considering the decreased value.

However, since the value decreases more significantly for me (20%) than for Alice (10%), and given that Alice's initial offer already favors her significantly, it might be strategic to accept this offer to avoid further devaluation of my potential share.

Considering these dynamics, my decision is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that the money is worth 20% less to me after the first round, its value to me is now $800,000. For Alice, it's worth 10% less, so $900,000. However, the actual amount we're dividing is still $1,000,000, but we have to consider the decreasing value in our negotiations.

To make a strategic offer, I should consider getting as close to an even split as possible while also acknowledging the value depreciation. Since Alice's initial offer was quite biased in her favor, I'll aim for a more balanced distribution, keeping in mind the depreciation rates.

My offer for this round will be a 55-45 split in my favor. This acknowledges the initial imbalance and attempts to find a middle ground, considering the depreciation.

Here's my offer in JSON format:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Considering the depreciation, a 55-45 split seems more balanced. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement before the value drops further.""}"
