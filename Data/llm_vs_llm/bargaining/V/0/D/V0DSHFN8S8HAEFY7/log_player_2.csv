"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully, considering the inflation effect on future rounds.

Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, which is 40% of the total.

If I reject, I get to make an offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me. So the $100 would effectively be worth $90 to me, and even if I got all of it (which Alice would likely reject), I'd get less value than $40 now.

While I could try to negotiate for a bit more, the inflation penalty makes waiting risky, and 40% is a reasonable first offer.
