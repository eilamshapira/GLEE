Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. With inflation affecting my returns each round, I think this is a reasonable compromise that benefits us both. Let's not drag this out and lose value. 
# Alice gain: 5000
