"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, let's get this done quickly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer gives me $4000 while Alice gets $6000. Given that we're only in the first round and there's a 10% inflation penalty per round, I should consider whether I can get a better deal by rejecting and making my own offer next round.

If I reject and propose a more balanced split in round 2, my money would be worth 10% less, but I might be able to secure a higher nominal amount. However, Alice's opening split isn't extremely unfair, and the inflation risk increases with each round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I propose an equal 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. With inflation affecting my returns each round, I think this is a reasonable compromise that benefits us both. Let's not drag this out and lose value.""}"
