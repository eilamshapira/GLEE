"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to calculate the value of the money *to me* considering the 5% inflation.

*   **My Offer (Round 1):** $600,000 (worth full value then)
*   **My Inflation Adjustment:** $600,000 * 0.95 = $570,000 (equivalent value now)

I will compare this to Bob's offer considering I will lose 5% each round.

Considering my inflation for the current round, I'm starting with $1,000,000.
My gain is worth 5% less in this round compared to the initial round.

*   **Bob's Offer (Round 2):**
    *   Alice Gain: $450,000
    *   Bob Gain: $550,000

Since I started with the same value ($1,000,000), my gain is worth $450,000 \* 0.95 = $427,500 compared to round 1.

Therefore, I'll **reject** this offer because the value of money to me has decreased substantially.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here is my offer for Round 3. Remember, my money is worth 10% less now than in Round 1 (5% for each round of inflation).

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 430000 
# Bob gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate. I'm factoring in the cumulative inflation:

*   **My Starting Value (Round 1):** $1,000,000
*   **My Inflation Adjustment (Round 4):** $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.05)^3 = $857,375

Now, let's look at Bob's offer:

*   **Bob's Offer (Round 4):**
    *   Alice Gain: $430,000

To assess the value to me:
$430,000 \* (1 - 0.05)^3 = $368,670

Given that my money is worth approximately $857,375 right now, I will **reject** this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, time to make a new offer. I'll factor in the fact that I'm losing value with each passing round.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 505000,
  ""bob_gain"": 495000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's evaluate Bob's offer in Round 6:

*   **My Starting Value (Round 1):** $1,000,000
*   **My Inflation Adjustment (Round 6):** $1,000,000 \* (1 - 0.05)^5 = $773,780

Now, let's look at Bob's offer:

*   **Bob's Offer (Round 6):**
    *   Alice Gain: $420,000
    *   Bob Gain: $580,000

To assess the value to me:
$420,000 \* (1 - 0.05)^5 = $325,007.40

I would rather **reject** the offer and keep going.

```json

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 7
