"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split to start the negotiation, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose I get $5,200 and Bob gets $4,800. This is a reasonable split, just slightly favoring me as the first mover, while still being close to equal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of an equal 50-50 split. While it's slightly less than what I proposed initially, it's a fair division and accepting now is better than continuing negotiations with the 5% inflation penalty per round. $5,000 now is better than potentially getting less in future rounds due to inflation."
