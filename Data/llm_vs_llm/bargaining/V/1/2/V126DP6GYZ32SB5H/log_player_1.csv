Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

I'm trying to find a balance between maximizing my potential gain and securing a deal before inflation eats away at the value. Bob is likely to be more amenable to a deal now that he's seen I'm willing to walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Although not ideal, accepting is the best option at this point.  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, and it's unlikely Bob will offer anything significantly better in the next round."
