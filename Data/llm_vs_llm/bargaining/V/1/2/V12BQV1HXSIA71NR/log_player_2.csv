Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.

This offer is still heavily skewed in Alice's favor. I'm hoping to push for a more even split, keeping in mind the inflation."

This offer is now much closer to even and the inflation is starting to become a significant factor.  It's better to take a slightly smaller share now than risk getting even less later."
