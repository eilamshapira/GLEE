"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover. If you reject, remember that inflation will reduce the value for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal split so that we both benefit equally before inflation impacts our gains further. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* If I accept now, I'll get $500,000, but due to 20% inflation, it's worth $400,000 to me
* If I reject and make a counter-offer, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less in the next round
* Given the uncertainty of future negotiations and the compounding inflation effect, securing $400,000 in value now is better than risking further devaluation
