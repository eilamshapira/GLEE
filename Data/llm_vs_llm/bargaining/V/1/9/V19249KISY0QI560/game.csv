5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split it evenly this time. We both get 5000, and we can avoid any further devaluation. Fair is fair, right?",Alice,3,

3000.0,7000.0,"Given the rapid devaluation on your side, I suggest 7000 for me and 3000 for you. This way, you still get a significant amount before it loses more value.",Bob,4,
