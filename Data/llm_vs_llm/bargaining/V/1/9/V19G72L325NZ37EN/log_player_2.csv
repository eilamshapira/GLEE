"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. Seems fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $50 for me
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, my next round's money will be worth less
4. $50 in next round would only be worth $47.50 to me
5. To get more value, I'd need to secure significantly more than $50 in the next round
6. There's also risk Alice might reject my counter-offer

Given that it's a fair split and inflation will reduce my purchasing power in subsequent rounds, accepting this offer is the rational choice.
