Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough decision, as the value keeps decreasing for me. However, if I reject this offer, there's a high chance Bob will propose an even worse deal in the next round, potentially leaving me with even less than $45 (after accounting for inflation). It's a risky gamble to continue, and accepting this offer secures me a reasonable amount considering the circumstances."
