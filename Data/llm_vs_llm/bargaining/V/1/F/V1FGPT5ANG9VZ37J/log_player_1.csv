"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, considering I want to avoid multiple rounds due to inflation affecting my gains.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable first offer that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

If I accept now, I'll get $50 but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $45 for me. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 10% less. The risk of continuing and facing more inflation might not be worth it.

Given that Bob made a mathematically fair 50-50 split, and considering the inflation penalty I'm facing, this is actually a reasonable offer. If I reject, I might end up with less value due to inflation in future rounds.
