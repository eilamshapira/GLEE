470000.0,530000.0,"Hi Bob, for Round 1 I propose dividing the $1000000 so that you get $530000 and I get $470000. I’m offering you a slightly larger share since if we delay, my portion loses 20% in value each round. I believe settling now benefits us both, so let’s agree quickly!",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your previous offer, but considering the inflation effect on my side, I need to secure a bit more. Let's settle this round with me getting $550000 and you getting $450000. This way, we both walk away with a good deal before the money loses more value for me.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but the 20% inflation hit makes my effective share much lower. I believe we can work out a deal that better accounts for this change, so I'd prefer to pass this offer and propose adjustments in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid additional rounds and further devaluation on my side due to inflation, I propose locking in the division now: I receive $450000 and you receive $550000. Settling immediately ensures we both secure our shares without risking further loss. I hope you'll agree that it's best for both of us to conclude the game promptly.",Alice,3,
