"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 470000, ""bob_gain"": 530000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, for Round 1 I propose dividing the $1,000,000 so that you get $530,000 and I get $470,000. I’m offering you a slightly larger share since if we delay, my portion loses 20% in value each round. I believe settling now benefits us both, so let’s agree quickly!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your previous offer, but considering the inflation effect on my side, I need to secure a bit more. Let's settle this round with me getting $550000 and you getting $450000. This way, we both walk away with a good deal before the money loses more value for me. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but the 20% inflation hit makes my effective share much lower. I believe we can work out a deal that better accounts for this change, so I'd prefer to pass this offer and propose adjustments in the next round.""}"
