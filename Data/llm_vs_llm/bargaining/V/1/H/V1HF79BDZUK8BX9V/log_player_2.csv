"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, for Round 1 I propose dividing the $1000000 so that you get $530000 and I get $470000. I’m offering you a slightly larger share since if we delay, my portion loses 20% in value each round. I believe settling now benefits us both, so let’s agree quickly! 
# Bob gain: 530000 
# Alice gain: 470000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your previous offer, but considering the inflation effect on my side, I need to secure a bit more. Let's settle this round with me getting $550,000 and you getting $450,000. This way, we both walk away with a good deal before the money loses more value for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid additional rounds and further devaluation on my side due to inflation, I propose locking in the division now: I receive $450000 and you receive $550000. Settling immediately ensures we both secure our shares without risking further loss. I hope you'll agree that it's best for both of us to conclude the game promptly. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000
