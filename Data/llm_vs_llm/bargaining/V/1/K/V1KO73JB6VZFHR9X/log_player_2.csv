"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing that I receive $50,000 while she takes $950,000, which is only 5% of the total for me.

Since this is the first round and we have 12 rounds total, I have plenty of opportunities to make counteroffers. There's no inflation for me according to the rules, so I don't lose value by continuing negotiation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while still being reasonably generous to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the money, which would give us each $500,000. This is a fair division that treats us as equal partners in this negotiation."
