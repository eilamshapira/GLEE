"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor, considering I made the first move and took initiative.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since we're now in round 2, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. It's only fair considering the effort to negotiate and the time spent. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
* If I accept now, I get $40, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively I get $32
* If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, any amount I receive will be worth 40% less due to inflation
* My best offer in round 3 would likely still be rejected by Bob, and then we'd go to round 4 with even more inflation

Given this analysis, while the offer isn't great, waiting longer will only make things worse for me due to inflation.
