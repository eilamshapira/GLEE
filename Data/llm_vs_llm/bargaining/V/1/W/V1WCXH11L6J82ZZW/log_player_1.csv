Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us. If we delay further, we both lose value due to inflation - especially me at 20% per round compared to your 5%. Let's agree now and both walk away with $5000. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
