"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. This gives us both a good share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer and how it compares to what I might get in future rounds, accounting for the 20% inflation on my side.

Alice is offering me $4,000 now. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, my money will be worth 20% less, and if Alice rejects, her money will be worth 5% less in round 3.

Given the steep inflation penalty for me (20% per round), waiting too long will significantly reduce my potential earnings. The asymmetric inflation rates give Alice an advantage in later rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the asymmetric inflation rates (20% for me vs 5% for Alice), I need to make a reasonable offer that Alice will accept, as delaying is more costly for me.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us. If we delay further, we both lose value due to inflation - especially me at 20% per round compared to your 5%. Let's agree now and both walk away with $5,000.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the impact of inflation, but your offer undervalues my position. Let's meet in the middle - this ensures we both benefit from a deal sooner rather than later. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this offer carefully. The inflation impact is significant for me:

- Current round 3: My money is worth 36% less than round 1
- If we go to round 4: My money will be worth 49% less than round 1 (1-0.8^3)
- Meanwhile, Alice's inflation is much slower at only 9.75% now

Alice's offer of $4,200 for me is worth $4,200 Ã— (1-0.36) = $2,688 in original value.

If I reject and we continue to round 4, any amount would be further devalued for me. The asymmetric inflation rates give Alice leverage, as she can afford to wait more rounds than I can.

Alice has increased her initial offer from $4,000 to $4,200, showing some willingness to negotiate.
