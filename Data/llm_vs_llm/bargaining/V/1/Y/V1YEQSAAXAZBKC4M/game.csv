550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split that slightly favors me since I face a 20% inflation penalty each round. If we move to the next round, the total value for me drops to $800000, making any delay costly. This offer gives us both a substantial amount and avoids further devaluation.",Alice,1,
