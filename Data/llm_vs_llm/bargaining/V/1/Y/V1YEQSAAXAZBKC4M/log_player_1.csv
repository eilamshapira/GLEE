"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that takes into account the 20% inflation penalty I face each round, while trying to be fair.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split that slightly favors me since I face a 20% inflation penalty each round. If we move to the next round, the total value for me drops to $800,000, making any delay costly. This offer gives us both a substantial amount and avoids further devaluation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, since inflation does not affect me, I would like to propose an even split. This way, we both get an equal share of the money. Let's avoid further rounds and secure our gains. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
