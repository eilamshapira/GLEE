"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split that slightly favors me since I face a 20% inflation penalty each round. If we move to the next round, the total value for me drops to $800000, making any delay costly. This offer gives us both a substantial amount and avoids further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
