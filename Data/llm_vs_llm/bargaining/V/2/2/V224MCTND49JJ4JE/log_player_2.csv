"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is slightly better than Alice's first offer, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is hurting me more than it seems to be hurting her, so holding out much longer is risky. I'll make one more attempt to get a more reasonable split before considering accepting a less favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I am slightly increasing my share from the previous offer, acknowledging that time is starting to work against me due to inflation.  This offer is still favorable to me compared to what Alice has proposed so far, and it leaves room for me to negotiate down if she rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The impact of inflation is becoming too significant to ignore. While this offer is not ideal, it's better than what I might get if I continue to reject and the value decreases further.  Alice seems unwilling to budge much on her split, and I risk ending up with an even worse deal if this drags on."
