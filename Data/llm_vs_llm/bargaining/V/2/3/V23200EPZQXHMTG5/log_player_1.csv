"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a perfectly fair 50-50 split. We each get $5000, which is the most equitable division possible. This way we both walk away with an equal share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
