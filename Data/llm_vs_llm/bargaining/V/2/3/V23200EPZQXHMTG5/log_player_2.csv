"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I propose 5500 for me and 4500 for you. It's a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing to take $5,500 while giving me $4,500, which isn't an equal split. Since there's no inflation for me, I don't lose value by continuing to the next round where I can make my own proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I propose a perfectly fair 50-50 split. We each get $5,000, which is the most equitable division possible. This way we both walk away with an equal share.""}"
