"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both get a good share before inflation affects us too much. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. An even 50-50 split (5000$ each)
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
   * My 5000$ would become worth 4500$ (10% less)
   * Her 5000$ would become worth 4000$ (20% less)
3. While I could propose a more favorable split next round, the total pie would be worth less

This is actually a fair offer, and given the asymmetric inflation rates, delaying would hurt both of us. I'm better off accepting this even split now rather than trying to negotiate for more in future rounds where the money will be worth less.
