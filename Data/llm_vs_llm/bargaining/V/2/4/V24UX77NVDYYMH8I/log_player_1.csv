"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, keeping in mind that inflation will reduce the value by 10% each round if Bob rejects.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because I want to secure a good portion while still giving Bob a substantial amount that he might accept. If he rejects, the total value will decrease, which could hurt both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $4500, but with 10% inflation = $4050 effective value
   * This is significantly less than my initial proposal

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * The money will be worth even less (20% less for me)
   * The uncertainty of whether Bob will accept
   * We risk further devaluation of the total amount

While Bob's offer is lower than what I proposed, accepting now guarantees me $4050 in effective value. If I reject, the next round's inflation will significantly reduce my potential gains, and there's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer.
