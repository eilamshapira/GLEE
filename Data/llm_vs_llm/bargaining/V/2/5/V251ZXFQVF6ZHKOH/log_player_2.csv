"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

At first glance, a 50-50 split seems fair. However, with the 5% inflation penalty per round, I should consider that carefully.

If I reject this offer:
- The money's value will decrease by 5% next round
- I'll get to make a counter-offer
- But Alice might reject my offer, leading to further inflation

If I accept now:
- I get $5000 at full value
- No inflation penalty
- Guaranteed outcome

Given that:
1. This is a fair split
2. The inflation penalty makes waiting costly
3. There's no guarantee Alice will accept a better offer from me
4. First round offers in negotiation games often set important precedents

I think accepting this fair offer immediately is the best strategy.
