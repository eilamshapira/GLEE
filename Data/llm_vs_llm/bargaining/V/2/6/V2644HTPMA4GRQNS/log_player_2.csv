"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less to me next round
4. $400,000 now vs. potentially more but worth 5% less next round
5. If Alice rejects my counter-offer, we'll go to round 3 with 10% total inflation

$400,000 is a significant amount, but it's less than half. However, considering the inflation penalty, if negotiations drag on, I might end up with less value even if I get more nominal dollars.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

The inflation risk makes this a reasonable offer to accept, even though it's not a 50-50 split."
