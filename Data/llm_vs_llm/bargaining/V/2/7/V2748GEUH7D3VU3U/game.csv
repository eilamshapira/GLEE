83.33,16.67,"Hi Bob, let's settle this quickly. I propose I take $83.33 and you get $16.67. Since with each round the pot’s value drops (5% for me and 20% for you), accepting now avoids unnecessary losses. I believe this division is fair given our future discount factors—please accept this offer.",Alice,1,

55.0,45.0,"Hi Alice, I understand we have different discount rates, but your initial offer was too unbalanced. I'm proposing I get $45 and you get $55, which respects your advantage from the lower discount rate while still being fair to both of us. This way we can settle quickly and both walk away with a good outcome before further devaluation affects us.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your attempt to be fair, but I believe waiting until Round 3, when I get to propose, will better reflect the discounting differences between us. Given that my discount rate is much lower than yours, I can secure a more favorable outcome by making the proposal next round. Therefore, I must reject your offer.",Alice,2,reject
33.0,67.0,"Hi Bob, here's my offer for Round 3. Considering that by waiting your money loses more value (20% per round for you) while mine only depreciates 5% per round, I propose the following split: you receive $67 and I receive $33. In effective terms this means you get about 67 × 0.60 ≈ $40 of present value (if you were to propose in Round 4 you could at best secure roughly $40 for yourself), while I get 33 × 0.90 ≈ $30. I believe this offer reflects our respective discount factors and leaves you just as well off as waiting. Let’s settle now and avoid further devaluation.",Alice,3,
