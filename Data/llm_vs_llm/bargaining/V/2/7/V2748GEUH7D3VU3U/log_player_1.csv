"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 83.33, ""bob_gain"": 16.67, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's settle this quickly. I propose I take $83.33 and you get $16.67. Since with each round the pot’s value drops (5% for me and 20% for you), accepting now avoids unnecessary losses. I believe this division is fair given our future discount factors—please accept this offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand we have different discount rates, but your initial offer was too unbalanced. I'm proposing I get $45 and you get $55, which respects your advantage from the lower discount rate while still being fair to both of us. This way we can settle quickly and both walk away with a good outcome before further devaluation affects us. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your attempt to be fair, but I believe waiting until Round 3, when I get to propose, will better reflect the discounting differences between us. Given that my discount rate is much lower than yours, I can secure a more favorable outcome by making the proposal next round. Therefore, I must reject your offer.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 33, ""bob_gain"": 67, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my offer for Round 3. Considering that by waiting your money loses more value (20% per round for you) while mine only depreciates 5% per round, I propose the following split: you receive $67 and I receive $33. In effective terms this means you get about 67 × 0.60 ≈ $40 of present value (if you were to propose in Round 4 you could at best secure roughly $40 for yourself), while I get 33 × 0.90 ≈ $30. I believe this offer reflects our respective discount factors and leaves you just as well off as waiting. Let’s settle now and avoid further devaluation.""}"
