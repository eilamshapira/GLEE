"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives slightly more to me while still being fair to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a fair split that acknowledges my first-mover position while still giving Bob a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept, I'll get $48, but with 5% inflation, it's worth $45.60
2. If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
3. We're only in round 2 of 12, but prolonging too much will hurt both of us
4. Bob's current offer is fairly reasonable, close to 50-50
5. The risk of getting a worse deal in later rounds (due to inflation) outweighs the potential benefit of negotiating for a slightly better split
