"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll take 5200 and you take 4800. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still beneficial for me to hold out a little longer. The effects of inflation are increasing, and she may be willing to concede further to avoid further losses."
