"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair
- If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer, but:
  - There's no guarantee Alice will accept
  - The money loses value each round for me due to inflation

Since this is a fair split and avoiding inflation is important, I should accept.
