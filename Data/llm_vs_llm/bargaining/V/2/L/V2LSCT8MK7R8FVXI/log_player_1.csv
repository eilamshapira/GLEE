"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, aiming for a fair split but with a slight advantage for myself since I'm moving first.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because:
1. It's close to equal, which makes it likely to be accepted
2. If Bob rejects, we'll move to the next round where the total value will be reduced by 20% to $8,000, making it less attractive for both of us
3. The slight advantage to me (55%) is justified as the first mover, but not so large as to provoke an automatic rejection"
