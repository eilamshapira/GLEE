"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which is equal on the surface. However, I should keep in mind that with each round, the money loses 5% of its value for Alice but stays the same for me. This gives me a small advantage in negotiation if we go to another round.

If I reject, I'll be able to make a counter-offer in the next round. Given Alice's 5% inflation penalty, she might be more willing to accept a slightly less favorable offer in the next round rather than risk further depreciation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's 50-50 offer, I'll propose a division that's slightly more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough that Alice would prefer accepting it over continuing to another round where her money would lose another 5% value.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a 55-45 split. This is still fairly equitable, but gives me a slight advantage. Since Alice faces a 5% inflation penalty per round, accepting 45 now is better for her than potentially getting less in real value if we continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice has offered me the same split that I proposed in round 2 (55 for me, 45 for her). This is already favorable to me compared to the initial 50-50 split.

Given that:
1. Alice is now facing a 9.75% inflation penalty on her gains
2. She's offering me the same terms I previously proposed
3. If I reject, we'll go to round 4 where her inflation penalty increases further
4. I have no inflation penalty so the $55 maintains its full value for me

This is a good offer for me, and there's no guarantee that Alice would accept if I tried to push for more in the next round.
