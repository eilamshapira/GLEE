"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60 for herself. This isn't exactly a 50-50 split, and she's getting the better end of the deal. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but I need to consider that the money will be worth 20% less due to inflation.

If I reject, the $100 will effectively be worth $80 in the next round. Even if I propose a more favorable split then, I might end up with less real value than the $40 being offered now.

Current offer: $40
Next round maximum (with 20% inflation): Any split of $80

Since rejecting would put me in a worse negotiating position due to inflation, and $40 is still a substantial amount, I should accept this offer.
