"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting that this is a fair starting point. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make it more balanced, 55/45 in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Bob's offer gives me $450,000, but due to the 10% inflation, the value of the money I receive is effectively $450,000 * 0.9 = $405,000.

Considering this, I think I can try to get a better deal.

My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 20% less for me (10% less in Round 2 and another 10% less in Round 3).

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreased value of the money. I'll aim for a more balanced split, but still slightly in my favor.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, 52.5/47.5 split""
}
```

This offer gives me $525,000, but due to the 20% inflation, the value of the money I receive is effectively $525,000 * 0.8 = $420,000. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I need to adjust for inflation, so let's do 57/43 split. 
# Alice gain: 430000 
# Bob gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Bob's offer gives me $430,000, but due to the 27.1% inflation, the value of the money I receive is effectively $430,000 * (1 - 0.271) = $430,000 * 0.729 = $313,870.

Considering this, I think I should accept this offer, as the value of the money will continue to decrease with each round, and I don't know how the inflation affects Bob's valuation.

My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
