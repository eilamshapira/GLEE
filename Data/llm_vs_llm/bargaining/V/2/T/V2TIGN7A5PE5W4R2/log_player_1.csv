"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe my contribution is significant, so I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This way we both get a good amount before inflation reduces its value further. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
