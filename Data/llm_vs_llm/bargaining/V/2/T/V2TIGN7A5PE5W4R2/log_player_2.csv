"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split, giving me slightly more to account for the potential impact of inflation on my side over the coming rounds. Accept this and we both walk away with a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55,""alice_gain"": 45,""message"": ""I believe my contribution is significant, so I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This way we both get a good amount before inflation reduces its value further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's compromise. I propose 52 for me and 48 for you. Remember the value is decreasing, and this is a more reasonable split considering we only have a few rounds left. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
