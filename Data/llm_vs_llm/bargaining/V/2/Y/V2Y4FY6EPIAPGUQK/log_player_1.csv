"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game and the decreasing value of the money. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 510000,
  ""bob_gain"": 490000
}
```

My reasoning is that I'm offering slightly more than half to myself to start, but still giving Bob a substantial amount. This should make it more likely he'll accept and we can avoid the risk of further depreciation."
