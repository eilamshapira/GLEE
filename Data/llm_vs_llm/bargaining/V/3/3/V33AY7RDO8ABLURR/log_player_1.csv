"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, so I'm proposing a 52/48 split in your favor. Let's settle this now before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer.

For me (Alice), the money is worth 5% less, so the $520,000 is actually worth $520,000 * 0.95 = $494,000.
For Bob, the money is worth 20% less, so the $480,000 is actually worth $480,000 * 0.80 = $384,000.

Given that the offer is in my favor and considering the inflation, I think it's a reasonable proposal.
