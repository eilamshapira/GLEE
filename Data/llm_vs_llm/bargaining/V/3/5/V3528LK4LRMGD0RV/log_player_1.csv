"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Alice, and I need to make an offer to Bob to divide $10,000. I need to consider the inflation rate for both of us, which is significantly higher for Bob. I want to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept, given the rapidly decreasing value of the money for him.

Here's my first offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   I'm asking for $6000, leaving $4000 for Bob. This might seem unfair at first glance, but I'm betting that Bob's perceived value of $4000 (after his 20% inflation) is less than my perceived value of $6000 (after my 5% inflation) if we go to the next round. Therefore, he will accept the offer."
