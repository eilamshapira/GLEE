"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Current offer: $4000 for me, $6000 for Alice
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less for me in the next round
3. In the next round, $10,000 would only be worth $8,000 for me
4. Even if I propose a better split next round, I would need to get more than $5,000 to beat the current $4,000 offer
5. Plus, Alice might reject my offer, leading to even more depreciation

Since Alice is facing less depreciation (5%), she has more negotiating power. While the split isn't exactly fair, the high depreciation rate makes it risky for me to reject.
