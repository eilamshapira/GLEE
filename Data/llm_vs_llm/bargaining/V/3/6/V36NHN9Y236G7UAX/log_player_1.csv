"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a fair 50/50 split of the $1,000,000. Given that each round delays our payoff (with mine decreasing by 20% each round), let's both secure the maximized value now. I look forward to a swift agreement. â€“Alice""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the opening offer, but I believe a slightly better split is in order. How about we start round two with this proposal? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, given the 20% inflation penalty in each round for me, this offer gives me 450,000, which is hard to improve upon under the current circumstances. I believe accepting is best for both of us.""}"
