"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a fair 50/50 split of the $1000000. Given that each round delays our payoff (with mine decreasing by 20% each round), let's both secure the maximized value now. I look forward to a swift agreement. â€“Alice 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
