"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer that acknowledges both of our interests while considering that inflation will reduce the total value if we don't reach an agreement quickly.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even 50-50 split where we each get $5,000. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with equal amounts, avoiding the 10% loss that would occur if we move to another round."
