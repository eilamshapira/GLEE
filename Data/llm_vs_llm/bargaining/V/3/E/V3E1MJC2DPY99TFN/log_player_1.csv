"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose an offer that is fair considering the inflation aspect of this game.

{""alice_gain"": 58, 
""bob_gain"": 42}

I suggest we split it this way since with each passing round, your money loses 20% of its value, Bob. If we go to round 2, the $100 would only be worth $80 to you. This split gives you a better outcome now than what you'd likely get in future rounds due to inflation affecting your share."
