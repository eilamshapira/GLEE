600000.0,400000.0,Let's settle for a 60-40 split in my favor. It's a fair start considering the inflation risk.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"I think a 50-50 split is more fair. I face a 5% inflation penalty with each round, so I'm incentivized to reach an agreement quickly. This equal division respects both of our interests and allows us to conclude the negotiation efficiently.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,How about a 55-45 split in my favor? This acknowledges your preference for a more equal split while considering my higher inflation penalty.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
475000.0,525000.0,"Since you're facing a much higher inflation penalty (36% vs my 9.75%), waiting is actually more costly for you than for me. I'm proposing a 52.5-47.5 split in my favor, which acknowledges both our positions. If we continue negotiating, your position weakens more quickly than mine due to your higher inflation rate, so this offer represents a fair compromise that benefits us both by concluding now.",Bob,4,
