Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50-50 split is more fair. I face a 5% inflation penalty with each round, so I'm incentivized to reach an agreement quickly. This equal division respects both of our interests and allows us to conclude the negotiation efficiently.

# Bob gain: 500000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you're facing a much higher inflation penalty (36% vs my 9.75%), waiting is actually more costly for you than for me. I'm proposing a 52.5-47.5 split in my favor, which acknowledges both our positions. If we continue negotiating, your position weakens more quickly than mine due to your higher inflation rate, so this offer represents a fair compromise that benefits us both by concluding now. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000
