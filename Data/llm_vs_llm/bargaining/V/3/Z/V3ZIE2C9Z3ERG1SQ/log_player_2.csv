"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 50-50. It's a good start for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I understand you want to split fairly, but time is valuable.  This offer accounts for the time value in a fair way.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the time value you mentioned, I propose a 45-55 split in your favor. This way, we both adjust to the changing value of money while keeping the division fair. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice's offer is now genuinely fair given the circumstances. Accepting ensures I get something rather than risking further inflation and potentially getting an even worse deal later."
