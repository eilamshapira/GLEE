"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, 50-50. It's a good starting point, and we can end the game now without any losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. This is a perfectly fair offer
3. If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer, but:
   - There's no guarantee Alice will accept
   - I know I don't lose value to inflation, but I don't know Alice's situation
4. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush

Since this is a fair offer and there's no guaranteed benefit to rejecting it, I'll accept.
