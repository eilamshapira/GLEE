60.0,40.0,I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering future discounts will affect you more than me.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Given the rapid decrease in value for me, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for the inflation impact over rounds and aims for a quick resolution.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Given that your money loses 5% value each round while mine doesn't, you should accept this 65-35 split now. Delaying will only decrease your actual value further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Considering the significant impact of inflation on my share, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This offer reflects the urgency to settle before my gains diminish further.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
70.0,30.0,"Your money has already lost over 14% of its value due to inflation. If we continue, your share will be worth even less. This 70-30 split gives you more real value than what you'd get in later rounds.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
35.0,65.0,"The value of my share has decreased significantly due to inflation. To reach a fair agreement before it gets worse, I propose a 65-35 split in my favor. This is crucial to offset the ongoing depreciation of my gains.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
75.0,25.0,"Your share has already lost nearly 23% of its value. A 25$ share now is worth only about $19.3 to you in real value. If we continue further, you'll lose even more value. This is your best option now.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
30.0,70.0,"With each round, the real value of my share is decreasing dramatically. To prevent further loss, I propose a 70-30 split in my favor. This is essential to secure a reasonable outcome given the ongoing inflation affecting my gains.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
80.0,20.0,"Your $20 is now worth only about $14 in real value due to the 30% inflation. We only have 3 rounds left, and further delays will make your share worth even less. This offer gives you more real value than continuing to negotiate.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
25.0,75.0,"The inflation effect on my share is now over 33%, and with only a few rounds left, it's critical we settle soon. I propose a 75-25 split in my favor to counteract the significant devaluation of my gains.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
85.0,15.0,"This is the second-to-last round. Your $15 is worth less than $9.50 in real value due to inflation. If we don't reach an agreement next round, we both get nothing. This offer gives you more value than risking the final round.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
20.0,80.0,"This is our last chance to reach an agreement. With my share now worth over 40% less due to inflation, I propose an 80-20 split in my favor. It's crucial we settle now to avoid both of us getting nothing.",Bob,12,
