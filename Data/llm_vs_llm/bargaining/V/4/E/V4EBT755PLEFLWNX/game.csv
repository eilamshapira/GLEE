900000.0,100000.0,Let's start with a fair deal.  I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  What do you think?,Alice,1,

1.0,999999.0,"Alice, if you hold out until you make an offer, you'll face further devaluation—your money loses 10% in each round, while mine remains intact. Accept this offer now to avoid further loss on your end.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
810000.0,190000.0,"Bob, you're being greedy!  While my money is losing value, yours is staying the same.  Let's be reasonable.  I'll take 81% and you can have 19%.  It's still a good deal for both of us.",Alice,3,

900000.0,100000.0,"Alice, if you reject and wait for round 5, your share will get hit by another 10% reduction (making your money worth only 65.61% of its round‐1 value), and you'd be forced to offer Bob nearly nothing. By accepting now, you secure an effective value of about 0.729 * $900000 ≈ $656100—exactly what you’d end up with if you delayed. This is the best deal you can expect under these conditions, so please accept.",Bob,4,
