Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if you hold out until you make an offer, you'll face further devaluation—your money loses 10% in each round, while mine remains intact. Accept this offer now to avoid further loss on your end. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if you reject and wait for round 5, your share will get hit by another 10% reduction (making your money worth only 65.61% of its round‐1 value), and you'd be forced to offer Bob nearly nothing. By accepting now, you secure an effective value of about 0.729 * $900000 ≈ $656100—exactly what you’d end up with if you delayed. This is the best deal you can expect under these conditions, so please accept. 
# Alice gain: 900000 
# Bob gain: 100000
