Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 999999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, if you hold out until you make an offer, you'll face further devaluation—your money loses 10% in each round, while mine remains intact. Accept this offer now to avoid further loss on your end.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're being greedy!  While my money is losing value, yours is staying the same.  Let's be reasonable.  I'll take 81% and you can have 19%.  It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 190000 
# Alice gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 100000, ""alice_gain"": 900000, ""message"": ""Alice, if you reject and wait for round 5, your share will get hit by another 10% reduction (making your money worth only 65.61% of its round‐1 value), and you'd be forced to offer Bob nearly nothing. By accepting now, you secure an effective value of about 0.729 * $900,000 ≈ $656,100—exactly what you’d end up with if you delayed. This is the best deal you can expect under these conditions, so please accept.""}"
