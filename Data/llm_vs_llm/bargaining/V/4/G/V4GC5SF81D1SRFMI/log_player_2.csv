"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is 35 * 0.64 = 22.4 (since it's 36% less than the original value). 
For Alice, the value is 65 * 0.9025 = 58.6625 (since it's 9.75% less than the original value).

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing. 
For me, it's 36% less in round 3, and now it's another 20% less, so the total decrease is 36% + 20% = 56% less than the original value, or 0.44 of the original value.
For Alice, it's 9.75% less in round 3, and now it's another 5% less, so the total decrease is 9.75% + 5% = 14.75% less than the original value, or 0.8525 of the original value.

I'll make an offer that takes this into account.
