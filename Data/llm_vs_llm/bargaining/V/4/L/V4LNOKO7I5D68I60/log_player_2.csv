"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair and gives us both a significant sum. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I receive $400,000 while she gets $600,000. This is a 40-60 split.

The game has 12 possible rounds, and there's no inflation for me, though I don't know Alice's inflation rate. If I reject now, I can make a counter-offer in the next round.

Given that we have plenty of rounds left and there's no penalty for me to continue negotiating, I think I can propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Alice. I believe a 50-50 split is the fairest approach since we're both equally involved in this negotiation. This way we both walk away with half a million dollars, which is a substantial amount for each of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the sentiment of a 50/50 split, but time is working against us here.  I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle with this offer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice Alice rejected my 50-50 split and is now offering me $450,000 while she takes $550,000. I also learned that Alice is experiencing inflation (9.75% less value per round), while I'm not affected by inflation.

This gives me some negotiating leverage, as delaying is more costly for Alice than for me. However, we only have 12 rounds total, and we're already in round 3.

Alice has improved her offer from the initial 40-60 split to a 45-55 split, which shows she's willing to negotiate. While I could try to push for an even better deal given her inflation pressure, the offer is reasonably fair, and there's risk in continuing to negotiate.
