Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less in each round, and two rounds have passed, the total decrease in value is 10% (5% in round 2 and another 5% in round 3). The current value of the money is 90% of the original, or 0.9 * $1,000,000 = $900,000.

However, for the division, we still consider the original $1,000,000.
