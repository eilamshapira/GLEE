4500.0,5500.0,"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm experiencing 20% inflation with each round, which significantly impacts my value. This 55-45 split would be more equitable considering my inflation constraint. If you reject, I'll lose another 20% of value in the next round, making it harder to reach a fair agreement for both of us.",Bob,2,
