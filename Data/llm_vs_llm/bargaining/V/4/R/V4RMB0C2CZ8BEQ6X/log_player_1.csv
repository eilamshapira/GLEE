"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm experiencing 20% inflation with each round, which significantly impacts my value. This 55-45 split would be more equitable considering my inflation constraint. If you reject, I'll lose another 20% of value in the next round, making it harder to reach a fair agreement for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
