"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60%, you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000, which is a 40%-60% split. If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but due to the 20% inflation, the total value will be worth less to me.

If I reject, the $10,000 would be worth only $8,000 to me in the next round. To match the current offer of $4,000, I'd need to ask for 50% of the pot in the next round (50% of $8,000 = $4,000). That seems reasonable to counter with.

I think I can negotiate a better deal, so I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a strategic offer now. Since I'm facing 20% inflation, the $10,000 is only worth $8,000 to me in this round. If Alice rejects my offer, she'll make a counter-offer in round 3, when the money will be worth even less to me.

I'll propose a more balanced split in my favor to offset the inflation I'm experiencing.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm experiencing 20% inflation with each round, which significantly impacts my value. This 55-45 split would be more equitable considering my inflation constraint. If you reject, I'll lose another 20% of value in the next round, making it harder to reach a fair agreement for both of us.""}"
