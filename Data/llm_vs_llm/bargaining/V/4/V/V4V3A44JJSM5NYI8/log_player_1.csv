"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's make this fair and efficient. I'm offering you a generous 45% share so we can both walk away happy without wasting time and losing money to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly at 50% each. This way, we both benefit equally without losing too much to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Given that inflation is reducing my potential gains by 20% each round, accepting a 50-50 split now is better than risking further rounds where my share would be worth even less. If I reject, my next offer would effectively be worth less due to inflation, and Bob might reject again, leading to even greater losses. A 500,000$ share now, even with the 20% reduction in value, is still worth 400,000$ to me, which is a reasonable outcome."
