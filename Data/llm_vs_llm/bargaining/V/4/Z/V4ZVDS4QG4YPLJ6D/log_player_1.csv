"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that considers both the time pressure from inflation and the need for a fair split. Since Bob's inflation penalty is higher (20% vs my 10%), he has more incentive to accept an early deal.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because it offers Bob a significant portion while acknowledging my position as the first mover. I want to avoid multiple rounds where we both lose value, especially Bob who faces 20% depreciation per round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. It's actually the same split I proposed in round 1
2. Due to inflation, if I reject and we go to another round, my $6000 would be worth even less (another 10% decrease)
3. There's no guarantee I would get a better deal in the next round
4. Since Bob is proposing the same split I initially suggested, it suggests this is a fair equilibrium point"
