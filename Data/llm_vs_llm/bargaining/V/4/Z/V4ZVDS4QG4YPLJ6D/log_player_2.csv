"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual value I'm considering is 80% of $10,000, which is $8,000. 

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the reduced value. Let's say I offer 50% of the reduced value to myself and 50% to Alice.

My offer:
{""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""alice_gain"": 6000}"
