"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me, $600,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   - My money will be worth 10% less next round
   - Alice's money will be worth 5% less next round
4. So if I reject, the maximum I could get next round would be worth less than now

Even though the split isn't 50-50, given the asymmetric inflation rates that hurt me more than Alice, it's better to accept this reasonable offer now rather than risk getting less value in future rounds.
