Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 9.75% less for me after 3 rounds (5% in round 1, 5% in round 2, and the initial 5% inflation for this round is already accounted for in the previous round's calculation, but now another 5% is applied for this round, making it approximately 14.76% less valuable for me compared to the start, but I've only accounted for 3 rounds of inflation so far), and Alice's gain remains unaffected by inflation, I'll make a more generous offer to Alice.
