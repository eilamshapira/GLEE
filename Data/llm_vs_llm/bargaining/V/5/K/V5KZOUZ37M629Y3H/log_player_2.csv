"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer. This gives us both a good amount, with me taking slightly more as the proposer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4,500 out of $10,000
2. This is a 45%-55% split
3. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less next round ($9,500 total)
4. Her reasoning for taking more as the proposer is debatable
5. However, this is a fairly reasonable first offer

While I could try to negotiate for a 50-50 split, the risk of losing value through inflation and potential back-and-forth makes this offer acceptable. It's close enough to fair, and securing $4,500 now is better than risking less in future rounds.
