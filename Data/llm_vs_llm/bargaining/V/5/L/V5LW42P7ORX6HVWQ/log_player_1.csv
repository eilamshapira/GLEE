Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, how about we seal this deal now? I'm offering you $50000 while I take $950000. With every round we wait, uncertainty—and potential inflation—could cost you dearly. Accept this offer and let's both walk away well off today.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider this: If you reject, you'll move to round 5 where, thanks to inflation, you'll effectively lose almost everything. Accepting $10000 now guarantees you something rather than ending up with nothing later. I'm offering you a token amount to seal the deal immediately. Let's avoid further erosion of your share and close this today.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know you’re aiming high, but every round you wait further erodes the real value of your share while mine stays intact. Rejecting today means stepping into round 7 as proposer, but by then inflation will bite even harder, and you risk ending up with far less in effective dollars. I’m offering you $20000 nominal now – more than what you’d effectively secure in the next round. Let's end this before further losses accrue.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know you’re worried about inflation eating into your share if we delay further. In this round, I’m offering you 350000 while I take 650000. While it might seem less nominally than some earlier proposals, remember that if you wait, inflation will only worsen your real outcome—your future dollars will be worth even less. This 65/35 split secures you a sizable nominal amount before the next devaluation hits. Let’s close the deal now and both walk away with what we get today.
