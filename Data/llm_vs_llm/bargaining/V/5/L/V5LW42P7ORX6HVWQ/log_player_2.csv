Accepting $10,000 now guarantees you something rather than ending up with nothing later. I'm offering you a token amount to seal the deal immediately. Let's avoid further erosion of your share and close this today.""}"

Rejecting today means stepping into round 7 as proposer, but by then inflation will bite even harder, and you risk ending up with far less in effective dollars. I’m offering you $20,000 nominal now – more than what you’d effectively secure in the next round. Let's end this before further losses accrue.""}"

In this round, I’m offering you 350,000 while I take 650,000. While it might seem less nominally than some earlier proposals, remember that if you wait, inflation will only worsen your real outcome—your future dollars will be worth even less. This 65/35 split secures you a sizable nominal amount before the next devaluation hits. Let’s close the deal now and both walk away with what we get today.""}"
