"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid the 20% inflation hit on my share in future rounds, I'm proposing we settle now. Iâ€™m offering $4500 for me and $5500 for you. Accepting now means you secure a solid share, and we both avoid the complications of further rounds. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer gives me $5500, which is more than half of the total amount, and considering the inflation factor that will reduce the value of the money in subsequent rounds, I think it's a reasonable offer.
