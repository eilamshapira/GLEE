"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation.

*   **My money is worth 10% less:** So, my $4500 now feels like $4500 * 0.90 = $4050 in terms of its real value.

Given this, I will make my decision.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's round 3. Remember that inflation is hitting me. My money is now worth 10% less than in round 2, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in round 2.

Based on this, here's my offer:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate the impact of inflation:

*   **My money is worth 27.1% less than in round 1:** This means my $4000 is now worth $4000 * (1 - 0.271) = $4000 * 0.729 = $2916 in terms of its real value.

Given this significant reduction in value, and the fact that we're already in round 4, I need to be more strategic.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's round 5. The inflation is accumulating, and I must adjust my strategy. I need to ensure I secure a reasonable amount while considering the reduced value of the money.

Here's my offer:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```"
