"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which is objectively fair. While I could reject and try to negotiate for more, there are several factors to consider:

1. The money's value remains constant for me across rounds (0% inflation)
2. I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which could influence later negotiations
3. We have a 12-round limit, after which we both get nothing
4. $500,000 is a substantial amount

Given that this is a fair offer with no risk of inflation loss for me, and considering that trying to negotiate for more could lead to a worse outcome or even nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds, accepting this offer seems like the rational choice.
