"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a proposal that's fair and takes into account the fact that money loses value with each round.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose an equal split of $50 each. This is the fairest division and allows us both to maximize our gains without risking inflation reducing the total value."
