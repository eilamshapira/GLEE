"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, don't risk losing value!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the value will decrease if we keep going.  Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was rejected, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, Bob's gain is now worth 10% less than the previous round, and 19% less than the initial round (1 - 0.9 * 0.9). My gain is still worth the same.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 65, 
""bob_gain"": 35, 
""message"": ""Don't wait, the value will keep dropping for you!""}"
