"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I'm happy to share more if you accept! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10000 (40%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, the total money will be worth 20% less ($8000 total)
4. My counteroffer would need to be good enough to be accepted, or we risk losing more value

While Alice's offer isn't exactly 50-50, getting $4000 now is better than risking further devaluation. If I reject, the total pot becomes $8000, and even if I get a larger percentage, I might end up with less in absolute terms.
