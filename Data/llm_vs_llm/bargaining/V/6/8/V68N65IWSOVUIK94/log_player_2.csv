"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly. I'm offering you a good amount to avoid further rounds. What do you say?

# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a more balanced split considering the inflation. This offer benefits us both in the long run.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try this again. I'm giving you a bit more this time, trying to find a solution that is good for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is only slightly better than her last one, and the money is losing value quickly for me. It's worth risking another round to aim for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The value is dropping rapidly. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it before it shrinks even further.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Final offer. I'm giving you a significant portion now to ensure we both get something. Take it or risk getting even less. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While not ideal, the value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round, especially for me. Accepting Alice's offer, even though it favors her, is the most logical choice at this point to avoid ending up with even less."
