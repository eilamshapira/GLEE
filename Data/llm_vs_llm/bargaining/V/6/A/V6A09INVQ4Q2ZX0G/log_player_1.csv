"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split while slightly favoring myself, as I have the first-mover advantage.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's reasonably fair and should be acceptable to Bob
2. If Bob rejects, the total amount will decrease by 5% in the next round
3. A 55-45 split acknowledges my first-mover position while not being too greedy"
