"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 45% ($450,000) while keeping 55% ($550,000)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, there will be a 5% inflation penalty, meaning the total value will be $950,000
4. My $450,000 is still a substantial amount
5. Rejecting might lead to a back-and-forth that could cost us both through inflation
6. The offer is reasonably fair, not too far from a 50-50 split

While I could try to negotiate for a more even split, the inflation penalty makes this a risky strategy. The current offer is good enough that it's better to accept now than risk losing value through inflation.
