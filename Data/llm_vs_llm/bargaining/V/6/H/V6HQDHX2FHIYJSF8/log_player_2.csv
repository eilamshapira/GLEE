"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Looking at Alice's offer, she wants $6000 while giving me $4000 out of the $10,000 total.

I need to consider the inflation penalties. My money loses 5% value each round, while Alice's loses 20% each round. This gives me a stronger position in later rounds since Alice's money will depreciate faster than mine.

If I reject now and make a counter-offer in round 2, Alice will face a 20% depreciation if she rejects my next offer. This puts pressure on her to accept a more favorable deal for me.

Given these dynamics, I'll reject this initial offer to propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's money depreciates much faster than mine (20% vs. 5% per round), I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for this difference. If Alice rejects, the value will decrease more for her than for me in the next round, which should incentivize her to accept a reasonable offer now.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a split where I get $5500 and Alice gets $4500. This is fair considering the inflation dynamics - if we continue to later rounds, both of us will lose value, but Alice will lose significantly more due to her higher depreciation rate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Looking at Alice's new offer of $4500 for me and $5500 for her, I need to consider:

1) The money has depreciated - my portion is worth 9.75% less than in round 1, and Alice's is worth 36% less.

2) If I reject and we move to round 4, my money will depreciate further (by 5% more), but Alice's will depreciate even more (by 20% more).

3) Alice has moved from her initial 6000/4000 split to a 5500/4500 split, showing some willingness to negotiate.

However, given the significant disadvantage Alice faces with each passing round due to her higher depreciation rate, I believe I can get a better offer by rejecting this one. The inflation difference gives me leverage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the inflation dynamics, I'll make an offer that reflects my stronger negotiating position. Alice's money is depreciating much faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round), so continuing to later rounds hurts her more than me.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering a split where I get $6000 and Alice gets $4000. This reverses her initial offer, and is reasonable considering:

1) We're now in round 4, so Alice's gains have already depreciated by over 36%
2) If she rejects this offer, her next round's money will be worth almost 50% less than round 1 value
3) The faster depreciation rate for Alice makes it rational for her to accept a less favorable split now rather than potentially worse conditions later"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze Alice's new offer carefully:

1) Alice is now offering me $4800 (up from $4500 previously and $4000 initially), showing she's gradually increasing my share.

2) The inflation impact is significant - my potential gain is worth 18.55% less than round 1, while Alice's is worth a substantial 59.04% less.

3) If I reject and we move to round 6, my money will depreciate further (another 5%), but Alice's will depreciate by another 20%, making her money worth about 67% less than round 1.

4) We're approaching the midpoint of our 12 rounds, and the depreciation is becoming very significant for Alice.

While I might get a better deal by rejecting, Alice's offer is showing meaningful movement in my direction. The $4800 she's offering me now is worth more than what I might get after more rounds of depreciation.
