"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start the negotiation with Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I suggest a 60/40 split, where I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. This gives Bob a substantial portion while recognizing that time is more costly for me due to the higher inflation rate on my side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's 50/50 split offer. Due to the asymmetric inflation rates (20% for me vs 10% for Bob), delaying further would decrease my purchasing power more rapidly than Bob's. The $500,000 I receive now is worth more to me than potentially getting a larger nominal amount in a future round where inflation would have eroded my share's value significantly."
