"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the rapid decrease in value for me, I propose a 55/45 split. It's more balanced given our different rates of value loss. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, I think Bob's offer is reasonable, but I'd like to weigh my options carefully.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, the $450,000 Bob offered me is actually worth $450,000 * 0.95 = $427,500 to me.

Given this, I think I can try to negotiate a better deal in the next round, but I also don't want to risk losing too much value due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, I'll make a new offer.

The original amount is $1,000,000, but due to inflation, the value for me has decreased by 5% in the first round and another 5% in the second round, making the total decrease 10% (1 - 0.95 * 0.95). For Bob, the value has decreased by 20% in the first round and another 20% in the second round, making the total decrease 36% (1 - 0.8 * 0.8).

My offer takes into account the decreasing value for both of us:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Considering the significant drop in value for you, I'm willing to give you a substantial share, but I also need to ensure I get a fair amount given the lesser impact of inflation on my side""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the drastic reduction in value for me, a 60/40 split is necessary to ensure I get a fair share before the money loses even more value. Let's end this soon. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer considering the inflation.

The money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so the $400,000 Bob offered me is actually worth $400,000 * (1 - 0.1426) = $400,000 * 0.8574 = $343,000 to me.

Given this significant decrease in value, I should consider whether accepting this offer is better than risking further inflation in the next round.
