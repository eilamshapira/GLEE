"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's end the game 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate Alice's offer:

Alice is proposing a split where I (Bob) would receive $400,000 and she would receive $600,000. While this isn't a perfectly equal 50-50 split, it's still a substantial amount of money for me. However, if I reject, I'll have the opportunity to propose my own division in the next round.

Given that I can make a counter-offer if I reject, and considering the significant difference of $200,000 between our shares, I'll reject this offer and propose my own division in the next round.
