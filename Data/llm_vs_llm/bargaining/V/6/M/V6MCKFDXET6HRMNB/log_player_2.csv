"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take 90% and you can have 10% 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This is round 2 already. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair offer considering the time pressure and inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting greedy. Let's split it 70/30. It's still a good deal for you, considering your money is losing value faster than mine. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer is tempting, accepting a 30/70 split in the third round would set a bad precedent for the rest of the game. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out.  My proposal is 55/45 in my favor. This is a reasonable compromise, and it benefits us both to agree now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. Let's compromise at 65/35.  It's a good deal for both of us, especially considering how much your share is shrinking with each round. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough one, but I still believe I can get a better deal.  Accepting 35% now sets a dangerous precedent, and the inflation isn't crippling yet.  I need to hold out a little longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm offering a 52/48 split in my favor.  This is a very reasonable compromise considering the circumstances. We need to settle this soon, and this is my final offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  60/40.  It's a fair deal considering the time pressure and the diminishing value of your share.  Accept it, or we both risk getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is getting too risky.  While I wanted a bigger share, accepting 40% now is better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
