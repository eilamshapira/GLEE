"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, a bit more balanced 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4500, but its value will be 10% less than the original value. So, the effective value I'll get is $4500 * 0.9 = $4050.

Since this is the first offer I've received, I'll consider it. However, I think I can get a better deal if I reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, the money is worth even less to me now (20% less than the original value, due to two rounds of 10% inflation). For Bob, the money is worth 10% less than the original value (5% less per round, for two rounds).

Considering this, I'll make a new offer. To calculate the effective value, I'll keep in mind that the money is worth 20% less to me and 10% less to Bob.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, before it's too late""}"
