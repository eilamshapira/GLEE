60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is actually fair because if we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to you due to inflation. So $40 now is worth more to you than even $50 in the next round would be. Let's settle this efficiently.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, I rejected your offer because it felt a bit one-sided given the inflation impact on me. How about we split it 50-50 this round? Considering the inflation, this is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's end this on a balanced note.",Bob,2,
