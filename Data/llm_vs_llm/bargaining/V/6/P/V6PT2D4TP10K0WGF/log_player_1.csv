"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll analyze the situation strategically to make a fair proposal to Bob.

Given the information about inflation:
- For me (Alice), there's no inflation (0%)
- For Bob, money is worth 20% less each round

This means if we delay, Bob's share becomes less valuable to him. If he rejects my offer now, in the next round:
- $100 is still worth $100 to me
- $100 is only worth $80 to Bob

This gives me some negotiating leverage, as Bob has incentive to accept sooner rather than later.

Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is actually fair because if we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to you due to inflation. So $40 now is worth more to you than even $50 in the next round would be. Let's settle this efficiently.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I rejected your offer because it felt a bit one-sided given the inflation impact on me. How about we split it 50-50 this round? Considering the inflation, this is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's end this on a balanced note. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether to accept Bob's 50-50 offer or reject it to make another proposal.

Looking at the situation:
- I would get $50 if I accept now
- If I reject and propose in round 3, Bob's money would be worth another 20% less to him
- In round 3, Bob might be willing to accept less than $50 (in nominal terms) since $50 in round 2 is worth more to him than $50 in round 3

However, there's risk in rejecting. Bob might make a less favorable offer in round 4 if we continue, and the back-and-forth could lead to both of us getting less value overall.

Given that $50 is a substantial and fair portion, and the 50-50 split represents a balanced and cooperative outcome, I'll accept this offer.
