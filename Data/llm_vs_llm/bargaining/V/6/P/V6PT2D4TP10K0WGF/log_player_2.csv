"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is actually fair because if we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to you due to inflation. So $40 now is worth more to you than even $50 in the next round would be. Let's settle this efficiently. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I rejected your offer because it felt a bit one-sided given the inflation impact on me. How about we split it 50-50 this round? Considering the inflation, this is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's end this on a balanced note.""
