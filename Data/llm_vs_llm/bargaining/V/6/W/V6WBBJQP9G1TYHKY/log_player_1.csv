I'm going for a big chunk, hoping Bob will accept it and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take something rather than nothing, I think I can still get a better deal.  I'll see if I can negotiate a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This time, I'm offering a more balanced split, hoping it will appeal to Bob's sense of fairness. With the inflation, both of us would get less if we keep rejecting offers."
