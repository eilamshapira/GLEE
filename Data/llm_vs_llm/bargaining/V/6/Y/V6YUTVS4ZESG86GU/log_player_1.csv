Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, taking the inflation into account, I need to adjust my offer. Since this is Round 3, my money is now worth 40% less (20% per round for 2 rounds). Bob's money is worth 10% less (5% per round for 2 rounds).

To make this appealing to Bob, I need to give him more, but I also need to secure a decent amount for myself considering the devaluation. I'll aim for an offer where Bob gets slightly more than half the original amount, hoping the diminished value for me won't make it a losing deal.
