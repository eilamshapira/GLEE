"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

For me (Bob), the money is now worth 0.95 * $1,000,000 = $950,000.
For Alice, the money is now worth 0.80 * $1,000,000 = $800,000.

Considering this, my offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll evaluate Alice's offer.

The total amount of money is $1,000,000, but due to inflation, its value has decreased. For me, it's worth 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of the original value, and for Alice, it's worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value.

However, since Alice's offer is in absolute numbers, I'll compare it directly. Alice is offering me $525,000, which is more than half of the original amount.

Given the significant decrease in value for Alice and the fact that her offer is relatively generous, I'll accept it.
