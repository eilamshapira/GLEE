"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the different inflation rates we face. Since my inflation rate is higher (20% per round) compared to Bob's (5% per round), it makes sense for me to secure more value earlier.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55/45 split in my favor, which I believe is fair considering that my money loses value more quickly than Bob's in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to consider our different inflation rates more carefully. After 2 rounds, my money has already lost 36% of its value compared to Bob's 9.75%. Let me propose a division that balances our different time pressures.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a fair 50/50 split. This acknowledges that we both lose if we don't reach an agreement, and with my higher inflation rate, I'm particularly incentivized to reach a deal sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With each round, my money is losing value much faster than Bob's. After 4 rounds, my money has lost nearly 59% of its original value, while Bob's has only lost about 19%. I need to be more strategic.

{""alice_gain"": 460000, 
""bob_gain"": 540000}

I propose a 46/54 split. This is a significant concession from my original offer, acknowledging that my higher inflation rate puts me at a disadvantage in prolonged negotiations. This offer gives Bob more than half while still securing a reasonable amount for myself before my money loses even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
