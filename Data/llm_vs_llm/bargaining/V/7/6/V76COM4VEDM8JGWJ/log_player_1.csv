"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $1,000,000 with Bob.

Given the 10% inflation penalty per round for me, I should make a reasonable first offer that Bob would likely accept.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an even 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests equally."
