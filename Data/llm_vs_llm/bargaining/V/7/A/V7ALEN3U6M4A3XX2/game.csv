450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Since I've already taken a 10% inflation hit, I'm proposing a split that's more favorable to me but still gives you a substantial amount. This is fair considering the inflation penalty I'm facing. If we don't agree, we both risk losing more value in future rounds.",Bob,2,
