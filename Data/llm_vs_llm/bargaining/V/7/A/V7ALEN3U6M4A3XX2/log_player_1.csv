Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":600000,""bob_gain"":400000,""message"":""Let's start with a fair division. I believe this is a reasonable offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Since I've already taken a 10% inflation hit, I'm proposing a split that's more favorable to me but still gives you a substantial amount. This is fair considering the inflation penalty I'm facing. If we don't agree, we both risk losing more value in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
