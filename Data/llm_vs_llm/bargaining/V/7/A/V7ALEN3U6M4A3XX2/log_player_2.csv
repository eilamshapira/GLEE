"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I believe this is a reasonable offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer would give me a significant amount of money ($400,000), I need to consider that the total amount is $1,000,000 and her proposal gives her a larger share (60%). If I reject this offer, I can make my own proposal next round, but I need to account for the 10% inflation penalty that would apply to me.

If I reject, the $1,000,000 would be worth $900,000 to me in the next round. I could then propose a more favorable split, but I should be mindful of making it attractive enough for Alice to accept.

Given that I don't know how inflation affects Alice and this is just the first round, I'll reject this offer to try for a better division in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for the inflation I've already experienced while still being attractive to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Since I've already taken a 10% inflation hit, I'm proposing a split that's more favorable to me but still gives you a substantial amount. This is fair considering the inflation penalty I'm facing. If we don't agree, we both risk losing more value in future rounds.""}"
