4202.36,5797.64,"Hi Bob,

For our very first round—and keeping in mind that each round costs us (5% for me, 10% for you) a bit of value—I propose the following division of the $10000: I take approximately $4202.36 and you get about $5797.64. I’ve arrived at these numbers by thinking ahead: if we continue playing, the future rounds (where you’d get to propose next) force you to account for a steeper discount, and I would be forced to concede more later. This split reflects our different discount rates and the finite horizon of 12 rounds. 

I believe this proposal is fair for both of us. I hope you agree and accept it so we can both avoid further losses due to inflation as the rounds progress.

Looking forward to your thoughts,
Alice",Alice,1,
