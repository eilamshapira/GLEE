"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4202.36, ""bob_gain"": 5797.64, ""message"": ""Hi Bob,\n\nFor our very first round—and keeping in mind that each round costs us (5% for me, 10% for you) a bit of value—I propose the following division of the $10,000: I take approximately $4,202.36 and you get about $5,797.64. I’ve arrived at these numbers by thinking ahead: if we continue playing, the future rounds (where you’d get to propose next) force you to account for a steeper discount, and I would be forced to concede more later. This split reflects our different discount rates and the finite horizon of 12 rounds. \n\nI believe this proposal is fair for both of us. I hope you agree and accept it so we can both avoid further losses due to inflation as the rounds progress.\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts,\nAlice""}"
