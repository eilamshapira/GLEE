55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob! Let's have a fair division. I'm suggesting a slightly higher portion for me due to inflation affecting me. If we extend to later rounds, we both lose value, so let's try to settle early.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice! I understand your concern about inflation, but since we don't know exactly how it affects you, I'm proposing a perfectly fair 50-50 split. This way we both get a substantial amount and can end the game quickly. Since I don't face inflation, I'm comfortable with this equal division, and it's the fairest approach without knowing your specific circumstances.",Bob,2,

57.0,43.0,"Bob, I appreciate your fairness, but due to inflation affecting me by 5% each round, a 50-50 split isn't actually equal. With a 5% reduction each round, I'm already losing value. This 57-43 split compensates for inflation effects, making it actually fair in real terms. Let's resolve this now to prevent further value loss for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
52.0,48.0,"Hi Alice, I understand inflation is affecting you. The system indicates it's actually 9.75% for you in round 3, not 5% per round as you mentioned. I'm proposing a 48-52 split in your favor to acknowledge the inflation impact while still being fair to both of us. This should compensate for your inflation concerns while giving us both a good outcome. Let's settle this now to prevent you from losing more value to inflation in future rounds.",Bob,4,

60.0,40.0,"Bob, we seem to be miscommunicating about the inflation rate. The instructions clearly state that with each passing round, the money is worth 5% less for me. By round 5, that's approximately a 19% cumulative loss (1 - 0.95^4). A 60-40 split helps compensate for this real decrease in value on my end. If we keep going, I'll need to ask for even more to receive equivalent value. Let's settle now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
55.0,45.0,"Alice, I now understand the inflation situation better. You're right about the cumulative loss - approximately 19% by round 5. I appreciate your explanation and recognize that delays hurt your position. I'm offering a 45-55 split, which acknowledges your inflation issue while still being fair to both of us. This is my best offer considering the circumstances, and I hope we can agree now to prevent further value loss for you. If we continue much longer, we'll both risk getting nothing in round 12.",Bob,6,
