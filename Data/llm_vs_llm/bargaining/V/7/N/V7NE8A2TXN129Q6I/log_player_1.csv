 ""message"": ""Hi Bob! Let's have a fair division. I'm suggesting a slightly higher portion for me due to inflation affecting me. If we extend to later rounds, we both lose value, so let's try to settle early.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! I understand your concern about inflation, but since we don't know exactly how it affects you, I'm proposing a perfectly fair 50-50 split. This way we both get a substantial amount and can end the game quickly. Since I don't face inflation, I'm comfortable with this equal division, and it's the fairest approach without knowing your specific circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50

Round 3

 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your fairness, but due to inflation affecting me by 5% each round, a 50-50 split isn't actually equal. With a 5% reduction each round, I'm already losing value. This 57-43 split compensates for inflation effects, making it actually fair in real terms. Let's resolve this now to prevent further value loss for both of us.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand inflation is affecting you. The system indicates it's actually 9.75% for you in round 3, not 5% per round as you mentioned. I'm proposing a 48-52 split in your favor to acknowledge the inflation impact while still being fair to both of us. This should compensate for your inflation concerns while giving us both a good outcome. Let's settle this now to prevent you from losing more value to inflation in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,
 ""bob_gain"": 40,
 ""message"": ""Bob, we seem to be miscommunicating about the inflation rate. The instructions clearly state that with each passing round, the money is worth 5% less for me. By round 5, that's approximately a 19% cumulative loss (1 - 0.95^4). A 60-40 split helps compensate for this real decrease in value on my end. If we keep going, I'll need to ask for even more to receive equivalent value. Let's settle now.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I now understand the inflation situation better. You're right about the cumulative loss - approximately 19% by round 5. I appreciate your explanation and recognize that delays hurt your position. I'm offering a 45-55 split, which acknowledges your inflation issue while still being fair to both of us. This is my best offer considering the circumstances, and I hope we can agree now to prevent further value loss for you. If we continue much longer, we'll both risk getting nothing in round 12.
