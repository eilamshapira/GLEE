Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 80,""bob_gain"": 20,""message"": ""Let's start with a fair division. I get 80% and you get 20%. This way, you still gain something!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50-50 split is fair. While I face inflation penalties and you don't, starting with an equal division respects both our interests. This way we can conclude the negotiation quickly and both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
