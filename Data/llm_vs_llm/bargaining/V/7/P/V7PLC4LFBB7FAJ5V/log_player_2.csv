"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I get 80% and you get 20%. This way, you still gain something! 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get 20% ($20) and she gets 80% ($80). 

This doesn't seem very fair to me. If I reject, I'll get to make a counteroffer next round, but I'll face a 20% inflation penalty. However, Alice faces no inflation penalty, which gives her an advantage in later rounds.

Given that I'm the one affected by inflation, it would be better to reach a deal sooner rather than later. But this initial offer is quite unfavorable to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable counteroffer that takes into account the inflation penalty I face.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I think a 50-50 split is fair. While I face inflation penalties and you don't, starting with an equal division respects both our interests. This way we can conclude the negotiation quickly and both benefit.""}"
