"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, 50-50 split. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. With a 20% inflation penalty per round, if I reject now, any future gains will be worth less. The current offer is:

* $50 for me right now (worth the full $50)
* $50 for Alice

This is a fair split, and waiting would only reduce my purchasing power. If I reject and propose in the next round, the money would be worth 20% less to me, so even getting more nominal dollars might result in less real value.
