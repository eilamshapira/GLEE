"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of the $1,000,000, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me each round. To start, I'll make a relatively generous offer to encourage Bob to accept early.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's offer. Let's analyze:

*   **Bob's Offer:** He proposes $400,000 for me and $600,000 for himself.

*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 10% less, and Bob's is worth 20% less.

Considering the inflation, $400,000 now is worth $400,000 * 0.9 = $360,000 of the original money *to me*.

Since the game continues for a maximum of 12 rounds, and I lose 10% of the value of the money each round, I need to accept an offer that takes this into account. $360,000 is acceptable for me.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
