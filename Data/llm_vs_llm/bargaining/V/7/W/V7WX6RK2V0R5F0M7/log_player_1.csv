"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair and reasonable split, offering slightly more to Bob to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I propose I get $45 and Bob gets $55. This is a fair offer that gives Bob a slight advantage, showing good faith and encouraging acceptance rather than prolonging negotiations which would reduce the total value due to inflation."
