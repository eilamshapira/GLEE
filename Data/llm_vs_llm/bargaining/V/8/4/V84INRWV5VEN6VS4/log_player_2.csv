"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4000$ and keeping 6000$ for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counteroffer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   - My 4000$ now is worth more than 4000$ next round (5% less)
   - Her money will be worth 20% less next round, giving me negotiating leverage

Given that there are plenty of rounds left and Alice's money devalues much faster than mine (20% vs 5%), I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Alice's money devalues faster than mine (20% vs 5%), I should propose a more favorable split for me, but still reasonable enough for her to consider accepting rather than waiting another round where her share would be worth even less.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's a reversal of her initial offer
2. For Alice, waiting another round means her share would be worth 20% less
3. It's not too extreme to immediately demand most of the money, which might lead to prolonged negotiation where we both lose value"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice has slightly improved her initial offer (from 4000 to 4200 for me)
2. Current value analysis:
   * My 4200$ is worth about 3791$ (due to 9.75% inflation)
   * Her 5800$ is worth about 3712$ (due to 36% inflation)
3. If I reject:
   * Next round my money will be worth about 15% less than original
   * Her money will be worth 50% less than original
   * This gives me stronger negotiating position

Since Alice's money is devaluing much faster than mine and we still have many rounds left, I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the increasing inflation pressure (especially on Alice's side), I should make a stronger offer for myself but still reasonable enough that Alice might accept rather than risk further devaluation of her share.

{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500}

Reasoning:
1. Alice's share is now seriously affected by inflation (her money worth less than half its original value if she waits another round)
2. This offer gives her 3500$ now rather than risking further devaluation
3. The split is more in my favor than before, but not so extreme as to guarantee rejection
4. If she rejects, her negotiating position will be even weaker next round due to the asymmetric inflation rates"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current value analysis:
   * My 4400$ is worth about 3586$ (due to 18.55% inflation)
   * Her 5600$ is worth only about 2294$ (due to 59.04% inflation)
2. The inflation difference is becoming very significant
3. Alice's money is losing value much faster than mine
4. We're approaching the halfway point of our 12 rounds
5. Even though Alice has increased her offer again (to 4400), the real value keeps decreasing

Given that Alice's share is now worth less than half of its original value, and will drop even more dramatically in the next rounds, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting. The severe asymmetric inflation strongly favors my negotiating position.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the severe inflation impact on Alice's share (her money now worth less than half its original value) and the continuing asymmetric inflation rates, I should make a stronger offer for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}

Reasoning:
1. Alice's share is now severely devalued by inflation (almost 60% less than original value)
2. Waiting another round would make her share worth even less (approaching 70% devaluation)
3. This offer gives her 3000$ now, which is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds
4. We're halfway through the rounds, so the pressure to reach an agreement is increasing
5. The 7000/3000 split reflects the reality of the inflation disparity while still giving Alice a meaningful amount
6. This offer should appear more attractive than risking further severe devaluation of her share"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current value analysis:
   * My 4600$ is worth about 3381$ (due to 26.49% inflation)
   * Her 5400$ is worth only about 1415$ (due to 73.79% inflation)
2. We're in round 7 of 12, pressure is mounting
3. Alice has again increased her offer (to 4600), but real values continue to plummet
4. Alice's share has lost nearly 3/4 of its value
5. Next round her share would be worth about 80% less than original value

While Alice keeps making small increases to my share, the severe inflation on her side suggests she should be more willing to accept a deal that gives me a larger portion. Given that we still have 5 rounds left and her money is losing value so drastically, I believe I can still get a better deal by rejecting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With Alice's share now having lost nearly 75% of its value and the severe asymmetric inflation continuing, I need to make a strong but potentially acceptable offer to avoid both of us losing everything.

{""bob_gain"": 7500, ""alice_gain"": 2500}

Reasoning:
1. Alice's share is now catastrophically devalued (73.79% less than original value)
2. Another round would make her share worth about 80-85% less than original value
3. We have only 4 rounds left after this one
4. The 7500/2500 split might seem aggressive, but:
   - 2500$ now is worth more than 5400$ next round for Alice due to the severe inflation
   - We're running out of time to reach a deal
   - The inflation disparity (5% vs 20% per round) justifies a more uneven split
5. This offer should be more attractive to Alice than risking further rounds where her share would be worth even less"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this critical situation:

1. Current value analysis:
   * My 4800$ is worth about 3184$ (due to 33.66% inflation)
   * Her 5200$ is worth only about 873$ (due to 83.22% inflation)
2. We're in round 9 of 12 - only 3 rounds left
3. The risk of getting nothing is becoming very real
4. Alice's share has lost over 83% of its value
5. Next round the inflation would be even more severe

Even though we're getting close to the end, Alice's offer still doesn't reflect the dramatic asymmetric inflation reality. Her 5200$ is worth less than 900$ in real terms, while my 4800$ is worth over 3000$.

Given we still have 3 rounds left and her money is worth so little now, I'll make one more attempt at a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

However, I need to be very careful now as we're approaching the end game."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With only 2 rounds remaining after this one and Alice's share having lost over 83% of its value, I need to make a strong but potentially deal-closing offer. The risk of both of us getting nothing is becoming very real.

{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000}

Reasoning:
1. Critical situation:
   - Only 2 rounds left after this
   - Alice's money has lost over 83% of its value
   - Another round would make her share worth about 90% less than original value
2. The 8000/2000 split reflects:
   - The severe inflation disparity (5% vs 20% per round)
   - 2000$ now is worth more than 5200$ next round for Alice due to the catastrophic inflation on her side
3. This offer should be more attractive than risking:
   - Further devastating inflation
   - Possibility of both getting nothing if we don't agree in the next 2 rounds
4. It's time to reach a deal before both of us lose everything"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 89.26% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this very critical situation:

1. Current value analysis:
   * My 5000$ is worth about 2993$ (due to 40.13% inflation)
   * Her 5000$ is worth only about 537$ (due to 89.26% inflation)
2. We're in round 11 of 12 - only ONE round left after this
3. If we don't reach agreement in the next round, we both get NOTHING
4. Alice is offering a 50-50 split, but due to inflation disparity:
   * Her half is worth only about 537$
   * My half is worth about 2993$

While I might be tempted to reject for one final negotiation, the risk is too high:
1. Only one round remains
2. Alice might reject my final offer out of spite
3. We'd both end up with nothing
4. Getting 5000$ (worth ~2993$ with inflation) is better than risking zero

{""decision"": ""accept""}

Better to secure a decent amount than risk everything for a bit more."
