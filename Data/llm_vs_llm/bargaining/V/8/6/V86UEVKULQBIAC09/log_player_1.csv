"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my offer in this first round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a fair division with a slight advantage for myself, since I know I'll face a 10% inflation penalty if we move to the next round. This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while protecting my interests against inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting slightly less than what I proposed initially, the 10% inflation penalty means that delaying further would diminish my returns even more. Getting $4,750 now is better than risking additional rounds where my share would continue to lose value at a faster rate than Bob's share."
