"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, Bob. 500000$ for each of us. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but inflation will reduce the value of the money by 5% for me. At the same time, I don't know how inflation affects Alice.

If I reject now, the $1,000,000 will be worth $950,000 to me in the next round. If I propose a more favorable split for myself then, Alice might reject, leading to further inflation.

The current offer of $500,000 for me is fair and guarantees me half the money without any inflation penalty.
