"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, the total amount will be worth $90 in the next round
4. My potential maximum gain in the next round would be less than now

While 40-60 isn't exactly equal, it's a reasonable offer. If I reject, even if I propose a more favorable split next round, the total value will be less due to inflation. The risk of continued negotiation and value loss makes accepting this offer the rational choice.
