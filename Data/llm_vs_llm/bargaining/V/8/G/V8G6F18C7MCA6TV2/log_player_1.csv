"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting that this is a fair starting point. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a fair adjustment given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $450,000 I'd gain is actually worth $450,000 * 0.9 = $405,000 to me.

Given this, I think Bob's offer is not in my favor. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less to me again, I'll take that into account when making my offer. The total value of the money to me is now $1,000,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $810,000.

I'll make an offer that's more favorable to me, considering the decreasing value of the money. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm being generous with 52/48. Let's settle this!""
}
```

Let's see how Bob responds to this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With inflation reducing the value further, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's time to end this before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less to me, the $400,000 I'd gain is actually worth $400,000 * (1 - 0.271) = $291,600 to me.

Considering this significant decrease in value, I think accepting Bob's offer might be the best option to avoid further losses. I don't want to risk losing even more value in the next round.

My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
