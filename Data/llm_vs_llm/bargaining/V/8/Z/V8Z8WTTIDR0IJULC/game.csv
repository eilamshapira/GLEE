600000.0,400000.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer. I get 600k, you get 400k. Accept this, and we both walk away with a good amount. Think about the inflation!",Alice,1,

650000.0,350000.0,"Okay, Bob, let's try this again. I'm increasing my share slightly to 650k, leaving you with 350k.  Remember, the money is losing value quickly! This is better than nothing.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to accept a deal that leaves me with less than 550k.  We're both losing money with each round.  Let's find a middle ground.",Bob,4,

700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Inflation is killing us. I'm offering 700k. Take it. It's better than the scraps you'll get if we keep dragging this out.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Alice, we need to reach an agreement. We're both losing money with every round.  Let's split it 60/40,  It's better than both of us getting nothing.",Bob,6,
