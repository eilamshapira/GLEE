"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, the money will be worth less to me in the next round due to inflation, while it maintains full value for you. Let's make a deal now!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering you face 20% inflation per round, this offer of $4500 now is actually worth more to you than $6000 would be in the next round ($4800). This is a fair split that acknowledges both our positions. Let's make this deal now and both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $4500 with 20% inflation = $3600 effective value
- If I reject and propose 60-40 in next round, and Bob accepts:
  * $6000 with 40% inflation = $3600 effective value
  * And Bob might reject again...

Bob's reasoning is correct - waiting longer will only decrease the value for me due to inflation, while he doesn't face this pressure. His offer gives me equivalent effective value to what I could get next round, and removes the risk of further delays.
