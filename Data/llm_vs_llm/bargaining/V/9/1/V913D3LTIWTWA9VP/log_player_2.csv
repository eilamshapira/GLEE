"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, the money will be worth less to me in the next round due to inflation, while it maintains full value for you. Let's make a deal now! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is right that she faces 20% inflation per round while I don't face any inflation
2. If I reject, in the next round I can make a counter-offer, and her money will be worth 20% less
3. $6000 for Alice in the next round would only be worth $4800 to her
4. This means I could likely negotiate a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer
5. We have plenty of rounds left (11 more), so there's no immediate pressure to accept

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that considers the inflation effect:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, considering you face 20% inflation per round, this offer of $4500 now is actually worth more to you than $6000 would be in the next round ($4800). This is a fair split that acknowledges both our positions. Let's make this deal now and both benefit.""}"
