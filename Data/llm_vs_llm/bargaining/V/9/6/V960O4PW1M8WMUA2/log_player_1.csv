"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":8000,""bob_gain"":2000,""message"":""I propose we divide the $10,000 with you getting $2,000 and I take $8,000. Letâ€™s make this deal!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split would be the fairest way to divide the money. We both get $5000 each. This is an equitable arrangement that respects both our interests equally. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
