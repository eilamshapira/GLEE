"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the $10000 with you getting $2000 and I take $8000. Letâ€™s make this deal! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing that I get $2000 while she takes $8000, which is an 80-20 split in her favor.

Given that I don't face any inflation penalty (the money is worth 0% less for me in future rounds), I have no pressure to accept an unfavorable deal. If I reject this offer, I'll get to make my own proposal in the next round.

This first offer is quite unbalanced in Alice's favor, and I believe I can achieve a more equitable distribution by making my own counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that gives both of us a fair share of the money.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split would be the fairest way to divide the money. We both get $5000 each. This is an equitable arrangement that respects both our interests equally.""}"
