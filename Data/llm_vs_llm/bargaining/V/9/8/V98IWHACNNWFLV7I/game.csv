5000.0,5000.0,Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
1.0,9999.0,"Alice, consider this: Accepting now guarantees you $1, whereas waiting only worsens your position due to inflation. Your future proposals will be discounted even more. I’m offering you a minimal amount that beats your next‐round outcome. Please accept this deal.",Bob,2,

3000.0,7000.0,Let's find a fairer split before inflation eats away too much of my share.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
100.0,9900.0,"Alice, every round you wait costs you dearly due to inflation (your money is now effectively worth just 51 cents to the dollar compared to round 1). Accepting this offer in round 4 secures you $100 nominal even though it may seem small—it’s far better than risking an even lower effective value in round 5. Let's settle now before further discounting erodes your share even more!",Bob,4,

2000.0,8000.0,"Inflation is heavily favoring you, Bob. Let's split it in a way that acknowledges my diminishing returns.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
1.0,9999.0,"Alice, consider your alternatives: If you reject now, you'll be the proposer in round 7—but by that time, due to inflation you'll be forced to offer me the entire 10000 because I can guarantee myself 10000 in round 8. In round 6, I’m offering you $1, which, given your discount factor of 0.32768 this round, is effectively better than what you can secure in the future. Accept this offer and avoid further loss.",Bob,6,

0.0,10000.0,I realize the game's dynamics are against me due to inflation. I'm willing to give you the entire amount to avoid getting nothing in the next rounds.,Alice,7,
