"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider this: Accepting now guarantees you $1, whereas waiting only worsens your position due to inflation. Your future proposals will be discounted even more. I’m offering you a minimal amount that beats your next‐round outcome. Please accept this deal. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a more generous offer to Bob this time. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I've already lost 36% of its value (20% in Round 1 + 16% in Round 2, compounded). I'll try to find a middle ground.

""bob_gain"": 7000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round you wait costs you dearly due to inflation (your money is now effectively worth just 51 cents to the dollar compared to round 1). Accepting this offer in round 4 secures you $100 nominal even though it may seem small—it’s far better than risking an even lower effective value in round 5. Let's settle now before further discounting erodes your share even more! 
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 9900

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I've lost a significant portion of the value already. The money I receive is now worth approximately 51.2% less than in Round 1 (20% in Round 1 + 16% in Round 2 + 12.8% in Round 3 + 10.24% in Round 4, compounded), leaving me with about 48.8% of its original value. I'll try to make a reasonable offer to Bob.

""bob_gain"": 8000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider your alternatives: If you reject now, you'll be the proposer in round 7—but by that time, due to inflation you'll be forced to offer me the entire 10000 because I can guarantee myself 10000 in round 8. In round 6, I’m offering you $1, which, given your discount factor of 0.32768 this round, is effectively better than what you can secure in the future. Accept this offer and avoid further loss.

# Bob gain: 9999

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Given the significant inflation impact, I've lost about 67.23% of the value already. The money I receive is now worth approximately 32.77% of its original value. Considering Bob's previous message, I understand that I need to make a competitive offer to avoid losing everything.
