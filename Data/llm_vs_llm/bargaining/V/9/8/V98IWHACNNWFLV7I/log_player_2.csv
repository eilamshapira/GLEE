Accepting this offer in round 4 secures you $100 nominal even though it may seem small—it’s far better than risking an even lower effective value in round 5.

In round 6, I’m offering you $1, which, given your discount factor of 0.32768 this round, is effectively better than what you can secure in the future. Accept this offer and avoid further loss.""}"
