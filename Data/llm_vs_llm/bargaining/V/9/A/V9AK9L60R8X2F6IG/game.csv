5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob, I think a 50-50 split is fair to start with. This gives us both $5000. Given that inflation affects me by 20% each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement early.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation effect on my side, I think a 55-45 split in my favor would be more appropriate. This gives you $4500 and me $5500. Let's settle this round to avoid further loss due to inflation.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but it affects me more severely (20% each round) compared to your 10%. Given this asymmetry, I propose $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This accounts for the higher inflation penalty I face and still gives you a substantial amount. Let's agree now before inflation reduces both our shares further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, considering both our situations with inflation, let's find a middle ground. I propose a 52-48 split in my favor, giving me $5200 and you $4800. This way, we both make a compromise and still get a reasonable share before inflation reduces our gains further.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, we're now in round 5, and inflation is significantly eroding both our potential gains. Given that I'm facing a much higher inflation rate (20% per round vs your 10%), I need to account for that. I'm proposing the same split you just offered but in my favor: $5200 for me and $4800 for you. This is fair considering my higher inflation penalty. Let's reach an agreement now - further delays hurt us both.",Alice,5,
