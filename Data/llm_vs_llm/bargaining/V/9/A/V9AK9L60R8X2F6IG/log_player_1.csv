"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I think a 50-50 split is fair to start with. This gives us both $5,000. Given that inflation affects me by 20% each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement early.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation effect on my side, I think a 55-45 split in my favor would be more appropriate. This gives you $4500 and me $5500. Let's settle this round to avoid further loss due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but it affects me more severely (20% each round) compared to your 10%. Given this asymmetry, I propose $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you. This accounts for the higher inflation penalty I face and still gives you a substantial amount. Let's agree now before inflation reduces both our shares further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering both our situations with inflation, let's find a middle ground. I propose a 52-48 split in my favor, giving me $5200 and you $4800. This way, we both make a compromise and still get a reasonable share before inflation reduces our gains further.

# Bob gain: 5200

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Bob, we're now in round 5, and inflation is significantly eroding both our potential gains. Given that I'm facing a much higher inflation rate (20% per round vs your 10%), I need to account for that. I'm proposing the same split you just offered but in my favor: $5200 for me and $4800 for you. This is fair considering my higher inflation penalty. Let's reach an agreement now - further delays hurt us both.""}"
