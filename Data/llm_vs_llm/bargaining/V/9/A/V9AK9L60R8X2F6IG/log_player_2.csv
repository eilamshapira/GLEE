"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think a 50-50 split is fair to start with. This gives us both $5000. Given that inflation affects me by 20% each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement early. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given the inflation affects me by 10% each round, I would like to propose a 55-45 split in my favor for the next round. This would give me $5500 and you $4500. Let's consider this for the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation effect on my side, I think a 55-45 split in my favor would be more appropriate. This gives you $4500 and me $5500. Let's settle this round to avoid further loss due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but it affects me more severely (20% each round) compared to your 10%. Given this asymmetry, I propose $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This accounts for the higher inflation penalty I face and still gives you a substantial amount. Let's agree now before inflation reduces both our shares further. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your situation, but considering the inflation effect on both sides, let's meet in the middle. For the next round, I propose a 52-48 split in my favor. This would give me $5200 and you $4800. This way, we both compromise and still get a fair share before inflation further reduces our gains."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're now in round 5, and inflation is significantly eroding both our potential gains. Given that I'm facing a much higher inflation rate (20% per round vs your 10%), I need to account for that. I'm proposing the same split you just offered but in my favor: $5200 for me and $4800 for you. This is fair considering my higher inflation penalty. Let's reach an agreement now - further delays hurt us both. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
