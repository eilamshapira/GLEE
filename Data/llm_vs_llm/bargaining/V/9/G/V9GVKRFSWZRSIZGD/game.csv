600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob! I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, the money will be worth less to me in the next round due to inflation, while it maintains full value for you.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's a fair and straightforward deal, and we can both walk away with a good amount. No need to play games with inflation - we'll both get a fair share!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, due to the 20% inflation that affects only my gains, I need a larger share to achieve fair value. My $650000 is actually worth $520000 to me due to inflation, while your $350000 maintains full value. This makes the real value split much more equitable.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this time.  But we both need to be realistic â€“ the inflation is affecting you more, but we still need to find a mutually beneficial solution. This way, we both walk away with a solid amount.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, please understand that due to compounding inflation, my share is now worth 48.8% less than in round 1. Even with this 75-25 split, my $750000 is actually only worth about $384000 to me due to inflation, while your $250000 maintains full value. This split is more equitable than it appears when accounting for inflation.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, we're getting close to the end of our time here.  Let's focus on getting a deal done. While I understand inflation is impacting you, I also need to secure a decent share for myself. This offer ensures you get a reasonable amount while giving me a larger portion to account for the upcoming inflation rounds.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
850000.0,150000.0,"Bob, with 67.23% inflation affecting my share, even this 85-15 split results in my $850000 being worth only about $278500 in real value, while your $150000 maintains full value. We need to account for the severe inflation impact to reach a fair deal. Please accept this offer so we can both walk away with reasonable value.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, time is running out! We need to find a compromise. This offer gives you a fair share, considering the impact of inflation. Let's end this negotiation and avoid the risk of losing everything.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
900000.0,100000.0,"Bob, with 79.03% inflation affecting my gains, my $900000 is only worth about $188730 in real value, while your $100000 maintains full value. We're running out of time, and this split actually gives us similar real values when accounting for inflation. Please accept this reasonable offer before we both risk getting nothing.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, we're down to the wire. This is my final offer. We both need to compromise to walk away with something.  This offer acknowledges your inflation impact, while still providing me with a significant share.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
950000.0,50000.0,"Bob, this is our second-to-last chance. With 86.58% inflation, my $950000 is only worth about $127490 in real value, while your $50000 maintains full value. If you reject this, we risk getting nothing in the final round. This offer gives us both meaningful value - please accept it so we don't both walk away empty-handed.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
250000.0,750000.0,"Alice, this is it. It's now or never.  I'm offering you a significant portion, considering the inflation. It's a chance to get something rather than nothing. Let's end this negotiation and call it a day.",Bob,12,
