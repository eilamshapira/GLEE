"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, the money will be worth less to me in the next round due to inflation, while it maintains full value for you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's a fair and straightforward deal, and we can both walk away with a good amount. No need to play games with inflation - we'll both get a fair share! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): A 50-50 split isn't fair when I'm affected by 20% inflation and Bob isn't. My $500,000 is now worth only $400,000 in round 1 terms, while Bob's $500,000 maintains full value. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Bob, due to the 20% inflation that affects only my gains, I need a larger share to achieve fair value. My $650,000 is actually worth $520,000 to me due to inflation, while your $350,000 maintains full value. This makes the real value split much more equitable.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this time.  But we both need to be realistic â€“ the inflation is affecting you more, but we still need to find a mutually beneficial solution. This way, we both walk away with a solid amount. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): Bob's offer is even worse than before. Due to 48.8% inflation, my $450,000 would only be worth about $230,400 in round 1 terms, while Bob's $550,000 maintains full value. This is very unfair, and I still have rounds to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""Bob, please understand that due to compounding inflation, my share is now worth 48.8% less than in round 1. Even with this 75-25 split, my $750,000 is actually only worth about $384,000 to me due to inflation, while your $250,000 maintains full value. This split is more equitable than it appears when accounting for inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close to the end of our time here.  Let's focus on getting a deal done. While I understand inflation is impacting you, I also need to secure a decent share for myself. This offer ensures you get a reasonable amount while giving me a larger portion to account for the upcoming inflation rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): Bob's offer is getting worse while inflation gets higher. With 67.23% inflation, my $400,000 would only be worth about $131,080 in round 1 terms, while Bob's $600,000 maintains full value. This is extremely unfair. We still have 6 rounds left to negotiate, so I'll continue trying to reach a more equitable agreement."

Round 7

We need to account for the severe inflation impact to reach a fair deal. Please accept this offer so we can both walk away with reasonable value.""}"

# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): Bob's offer continues to worsen. With 79.03% inflation, my $350,000 would only be worth about $73,395 in round 1 terms, while Bob's $650,000 maintains full value. This is extremely unfair. Even though we're getting closer to the deadline, this offer is too low to accept. We still have 4 rounds to negotiate a better deal."

Round 9

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning (not part of response): With 86.58% inflation, my $300,000 would only be worth about $40,260 in round 1 terms, while Bob's $700,000 maintains full value. Despite being close to the deadline, this offer is still extremely unfair. With 2 rounds left, I'll make one more attempt at a reasonable deal that accounts for the severe inflation impact."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000, ""message"": ""Bob, this is our second-to-last chance. With 86.58% inflation, my $950,000 is only worth about $127,490 in real value, while your $50,000 maintains full value. If you reject this, we risk getting nothing in the final round. This offer gives us both meaningful value - please accept it so we don't both walk away empty-handed.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is it. It's now or never.  I'm offering you a significant portion, considering the inflation. It's a chance to get something rather than nothing. Let's end this negotiation and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): While this is a poor offer (my $250,000 is worth only about $21,475 in round 1 terms due to 91.41% inflation), it's the final round. If I reject, we both get nothing. Some value is better than no value, so I must accept despite the unfavorable terms."
