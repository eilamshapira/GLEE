6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid the 10% devaluation penalty in subsequent rounds on my side, I'd like to settle now with a fair proposal: I receive $6000 and you get $4000. This way, we both secure immediate gains and prevent any losses from further delay. What do you say?",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I understand we both want to avoid inflation penalties. Your initial offer was quite favorable to you at 60/40. I'm proposing a more balanced split of $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This is fair since we're both facing similar pressures, and resolving this quickly benefits us both.",Bob,2,
