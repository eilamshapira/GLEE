"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid the 10% devaluation penalty in subsequent rounds on my side, I'd like to settle now with a fair proposal: I receive $6000 and you get $4000. This way, we both secure immediate gains and prevent any losses from further delay. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand we both want to avoid inflation penalties. Your initial offer was quite favorable to you at 60/40. I'm proposing a more balanced split of $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This is fair since we're both facing similar pressures, and resolving this quickly benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
