"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid the 10% devaluation penalty in subsequent rounds on my side, I'd like to settle now with a fair proposal: I receive $6000 and you get $4000. This way, we both secure immediate gains and prevent any losses from further delay. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000 total, which is less than half. Since this is only the first round and I know the money loses 5% value for me each round, I should consider whether I might get a better deal by making a counter-offer.

If I reject now, I can make my own proposal in round 2, though my money would be worth 5% less (so the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,500 to me). This gives me room to potentially negotiate a better split.

I'll reject this offer since it's the first round and I believe I can secure a more equitable division.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable division while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand we both want to avoid inflation penalties. Your initial offer was quite favorable to you at 60/40. I'm proposing a more balanced split of $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you. This is fair since we're both facing similar pressures, and resolving this quickly benefits us both.""}"
