"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. While I get $4000 now, if I reject and make a counter-offer, the total value decreases by 10% for me and 20% for Alice.

The total pot becomes worth $9000 to me and $8000 to Alice in the next round. That means I could potentially offer Alice slightly less than $6000 and still have her accept since her original $6000 would be worth only $4800 to her in the next round.

Given these dynamics, I think I can get a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now I need to make a strategic offer. Since we're in round 2, the money is worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice compared to round 1.

Alice values her $6000 from round 1 as only $4800 now. If I offer her slightly more than this, it would be rational for her to accept rather than move to round 3 where she'd lose another 20% in value.

I'll propose a division that's favorable to me while giving Alice enough incentive to accept rather than continue to another round with further devaluation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully analyze this situation. 

In round 3, my $4500 would be worth $3645 compared to round 1 values (19% less). If I reject and we go to round 4, the money would depreciate further - by 29% for me and 49% for Alice compared to round 1.

If I reject, Alice's $5500 from this round would be worth only $2805 to her in round 4. This gives me leverage, but I also have to consider that my counter-offer would be worth less to me as well.

Given the accelerating rate of inflation and the reasonable improvement from Alice's initial offer of $4000 to $4500, accepting now seems to be the better strategic choice rather than risking further devaluation.
