"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for the division of $10,000, keeping in mind the potential inflation effect for me:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning is that starting with a slight advantage for me might be accepted given the risk of inflation reducing my potential gains in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
