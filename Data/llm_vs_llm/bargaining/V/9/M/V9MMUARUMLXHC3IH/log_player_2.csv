"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, how about I take $60 and you take $40? It seems fair considering the situation. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully, given the 20% inflation penalty I face each round. If I reject Alice's offer, I'll propose in the next round, but any amount will be worth 20% less to me.

Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60.
If I reject and propose next round, I'd need to get at least $50 to equal the current $40 value (since $50 Ã— 0.8 = $40).

While Alice's offer isn't an even split, rejecting means risking value due to inflation, and there's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me in the next round.
