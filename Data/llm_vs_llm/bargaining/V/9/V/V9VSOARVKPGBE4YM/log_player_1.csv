"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a split that takes into account the inflation pressure on both parties. Since Bob faces higher inflation (20% vs my 10%), he has more incentive to accept an early deal.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's favorable to me but not extremely unfair
2. Bob should consider accepting since waiting will cost him more in value
3. If rejected, both parties will lose value but Bob will lose more"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $400,000 (worth 90% of original value = $360,000 effective value)
   * Bob gets $600,000 (worth 80% of original value = $480,000 effective value)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer, but:
   * Money will be worth 80% for me (another 10% loss)
   * Money will be worth 60% for Bob (another 20% loss)
   * This significantly reduces the total value for both of us

Given that:
- The current offer still gives me a significant amount
- Waiting will definitely reduce the value for both of us
- I could make a counter-offer next round, but Bob might reject again
- The inflation penalties make waiting costly
