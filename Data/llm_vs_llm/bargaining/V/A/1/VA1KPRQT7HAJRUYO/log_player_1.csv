"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's split the money. I propose I get $60 and you get $40. This is a fair offer considering we don't know how many rounds this will last and inflation is eating into my potential earnings.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the effects of inflation, I think it's fair that I get a bit more this round. Let's settle on this and avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
