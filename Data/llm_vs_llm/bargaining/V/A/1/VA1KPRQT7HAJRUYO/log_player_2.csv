Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money. I propose I get $60 and you get $40. This is a fair offer considering we don't know how many rounds this will last and inflation is eating into my potential earnings. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
