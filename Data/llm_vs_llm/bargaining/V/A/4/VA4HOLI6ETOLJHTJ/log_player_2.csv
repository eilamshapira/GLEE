"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly to be fair. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's proposal is to split the money evenly, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a fair and equitable division that gives us both equal shares of the total amount.

If I reject this offer, I would get to make a counter-proposal in the next round, but the total value would decrease by 10% to $9,000. Even if I tried to get a larger share in the next round, the total pie would be smaller.

Given that Alice has offered a perfectly fair 50-50 split in the first round without any devaluation, this is a reasonable offer that I should accept.
