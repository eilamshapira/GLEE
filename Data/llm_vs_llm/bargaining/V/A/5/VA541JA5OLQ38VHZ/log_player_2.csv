"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $4000 while she takes $6000 out of the $10,000.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the money loses 10% of its value for me, meaning the total would be worth $9,000 to me. Even if I proposed a 50-50 split in the next round ($5,000 each), that would be worth $4,500 to me after the 10% inflation.

Alice's current offer of $4,000 is less than what I could potentially get in the next round, even accounting for inflation. However, there's no guarantee Alice would accept my counter-offer, which could lead to further rounds and more value loss.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now it's my turn to make an offer. I need to consider that after rejection, the total amount is still $10,000, but its value has decreased for both of us (10% for me, 5% for Alice).

I should propose a fair split that's attractive enough for Alice to accept, considering that if she rejects, we'll go to another round with further depreciation for both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}

I'm offering a slight advantage to myself while still giving Alice a reasonable portion. If she rejects this, in the next round the money will be worth even less for both of us, so accepting this offer is likely in both our interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this new offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $4300 while she takes $5700. Due to inflation, the money I receive is worth 19% less than in round 1, which means $4300 now is equivalent to $3483 in round 1 value for me. 

If I reject and proceed to round 4, I would face another 10% inflation (making the total inflation about 27.1% from the original value). If I were to propose a 50-50 split ($5000 each) in round 4, it would be worth only about $3650 to me in round 1 value.

Since Alice's current offer of $4300 (worth $3483 to me) is less than what I might get in the next round even with additional inflation, and I get to make the next offer if I reject, it makes sense to reject.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","At this point, we've gone through multiple rounds of negotiations, and the inflation effect is becoming significant. I need to make an offer that Alice will likely accept to avoid further value loss for both of us.

For me, there's now been about 27.1% total inflation from the original value. For Alice, there's been about 14.3% total inflation. If we continue to the next round, these percentages will increase further.

I should make an offer that's fair considering our different inflation rates and the fact that Alice can make a counteroffer if she rejects.

{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200}

I'm offering Alice a slightly larger portion to increase the chances of acceptance. This is reasonable considering she faces less inflation than I do, and continuing the game will reduce the value for both of us."
