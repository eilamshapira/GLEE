"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor. This is reasonable given that your money will depreciate less than mine in future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the depreciation rates, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is more reasonable, as your money will lose more value in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 20% less than initial value = $36 effective value
- If I reject and we go to next round, any amount will be worth 40% less than initial value
- Bob's $55 is only reduced by 5%, so it's worth $52.25 to him

Given the harsh depreciation rate for my side and the fact that another round would significantly reduce my potential gains, this is actually a reasonable offer despite being less than 50%.
