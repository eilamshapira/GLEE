"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that slightly favors me since I'm making the first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I suggest I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount while accounting for my first-mover position."
