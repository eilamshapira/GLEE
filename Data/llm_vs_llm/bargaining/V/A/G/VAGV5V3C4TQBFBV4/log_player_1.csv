"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my offer to Bob for dividing the $1,000,000.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split of the money - $500,000 for each of us. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount, and since there's no inflation affecting my side, I believe an equal split is reasonable."
