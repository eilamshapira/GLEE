"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I want to make a fair offer that Bob is likely to accept, but I also need to consider the effect of inflation on my potential gain.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the money equally, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a fair and balanced division that should be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
