"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split it 55/45. It's a fair deal to start with, and we both walk away with a good amount. Let's not risk losing more to inflation by dragging this out. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer of $45 for me and $55 for her, while keeping in mind that if I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject and propose in the next round, even if I ask for more, the total value to me will be reduced by 20%. That means the maximum value I could get in the next round would be $80 (100% of the new value).

Alice's current offer gives me $45, which is decent. If I reject, I'd need to secure more than $56.25 in the next round to compensate for the 20% inflation ($45 รท 0.8 = $56.25).

Given the inflation risk and the reasonable initial offer, I'll accept.
