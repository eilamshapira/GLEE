"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing a fairly even split, with me getting $4,750 and her getting $5,250. The difference is only $500, which is 5% of the total amount. While I could try to negotiate for a more equal split, there are a few considerations:

1. This is a reasonable first offer
2. There's no inflation penalty for me, but I don't know Alice's situation
3. Rejecting might lead to a worse outcome if negotiations break down
4. We have limited rounds, and prolonged negotiation increases the risk of getting nothing

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer. It's close enough to fair, and the risk of getting a worse deal or nothing at all outweighs the potential benefit of negotiating for a slightly better split.
