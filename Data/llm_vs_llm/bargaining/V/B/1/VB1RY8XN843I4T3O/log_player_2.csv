"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which is fair in principle
2. If I reject, I'll make the next offer, but:
   - The money will be worth 5% less for me
   - There's no guarantee Alice will accept my offer
3. 50$ now is better than potentially getting slightly more later with inflation risk

Given these factors, a fair split in the first round is actually a good deal.
