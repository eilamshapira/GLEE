"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting an equal split of the money. This is fair for both of us, and we can both walk away with a significant amount without risking further rounds. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully given the 20% inflation penalty per round.

If I accept now, I get $500,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, even if I asked for the maximum ($1,000,000) and Alice accepted, I would only receive $800,000 (20% less than $1,000,000) due to inflation. More realistically, I'd need to offer Alice something to get her to accept.

An equal split in the first round is fair and avoids the inflation penalty, so I'll accept.
