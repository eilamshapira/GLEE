"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 65-35 split. Inflation is hitting you harder, so this is a fair adjustment. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): I'll reject this offer because even with 10% inflation affecting my share, I can still propose a better split for myself in the next round. With a 35$ share affected by 10% inflation, I'd effectively get $31.50. I can try for a better deal in the next round, even though I'll face 20% inflation then."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Let's be practical - with 20% inflation affecting my share, this 55-45 split is actually quite fair for both of us. My effective gain would be 44$, while you get 45$. It's essentially equal and we should conclude this now.""}"
