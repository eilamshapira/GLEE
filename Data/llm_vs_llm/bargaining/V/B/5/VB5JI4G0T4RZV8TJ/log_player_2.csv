Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical - with 20% inflation affecting my share, this 55-45 split is actually quite fair for both of us. My effective gain would be 44$, while you get 45$. It's essentially equal and we should conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
