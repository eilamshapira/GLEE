"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll need to make a fair initial offer that Bob would be willing to accept, while considering that if rejected, the total amount will decrease by 5% in the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is fair and equitable. This way we both receive $500,000, which is better than risking inflation in future rounds that would reduce the total amount available."
