"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing a 50-50 split of the $10,000, which would give me $5,000. This seems fair at first glance, but I need to factor in the inflation effect.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me. So if I were to get the full $10,000 next round, it would only be worth $8,000 to me due to inflation.

Since $5,000 now is better than potentially getting less value later (especially with compound inflation effects), and a 50-50 split is generally fair, I'll accept this offer.
