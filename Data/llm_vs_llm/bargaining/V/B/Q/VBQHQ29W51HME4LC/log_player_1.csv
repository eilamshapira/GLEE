"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting this is a fair starting point. Your turn to respond as Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's keep it simple and fair: 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, the $500,000 I would receive is actually worth $400,000 in real value (500000 * 0.8).

Considering this, a 50/50 split doesn't seem as favorable to me as it would have in the first round. I think I can try to negotiate a better deal.

My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in each round due to inflation, in Round 3, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in Round 2, which was already 20% less than in Round 1. So, the money I gain is worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of its original value.

To account for this, I'll make an offer that gives me a larger share of the original amount, hoping that Bob will accept it before the value decreases further.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance for a reasonable split, considering inflation!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $700,000 and giving Bob $300,000, with a message emphasizing that this is a reasonable split given the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. It's a better deal than you offered, and inflation is eating our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, the $550,000 I would receive is actually worth $281,200 in real value (550000 * (1 - 0.488)).

Considering this significant decrease in value, Bob's offer seems more reasonable, especially since he's framing it as a better deal than my previous offer and highlighting the impact of inflation.

Given the substantial loss in value due to inflation, I think it's time to accept an offer and secure some value rather than risking further decreases.

My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
