Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make it a bit more balanced. I propose $40 for me and $60 for you. This way, we both get a fairer share. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
