"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, offering slightly more to Bob to incentivize acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000}

I propose this split where Bob gets $520,000 and I get $480,000. This is a fair and reasonable division with a small advantage for Bob to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This split is too uneven, giving Bob 70% of the money. I believe we can reach a more equitable arrangement. Let's continue to the next round where I can make a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced counter-offer, still keeping it reasonably attractive for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which gives Bob a larger share ($550,000) while ensuring I receive a fair portion ($450,000). This is more balanced than Bob's previous 70-30 proposal, and I hope Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is still too imbalanced, with Bob taking 65% of the money. While it's a slight improvement from their previous offer, it's still not fair enough. I'll continue to negotiate for a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll adjust my offer slightly to show more flexibility while still maintaining reasonable fairness.

{""alice_gain"": 430000, ""bob_gain"": 570000}

I'm proposing a 43-57 split, giving Bob $570,000 and myself $430,000. This is more generous to Bob than my previous offers while still being more balanced than Bob's proposals. I hope Bob will recognize this as a reasonable compromise, as we're now past the halfway point in our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While this isn't the perfectly equal split I initially hoped for, Bob has moved significantly from their initial offers, and we're now at a 40-60 split. With 6 rounds already gone and the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within 12 rounds, I'll accept this more reasonable offer. $400,000 is still a substantial amount, and this represents a fair compromise from both sides."
