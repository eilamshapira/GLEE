50.0,50.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is completely fair to both of us. This way we both walk away with an equal amount, and we don't risk losing value to inflation.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, I think a 60/40 split is more fair considering I'm taking on the risk of us not reaching an agreement. Let's secure the money while it's still worth something! ",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I rejected your 40/60 split since it favors you too much. I'm offering a 55/45 split now, which is more favorable to me but still reasonable. Note that we've already lost 10% to inflation by continuing to round 3. If we keep going, we'll both lose more value. Let's reach an agreement now.",Alice,3,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, let's stop wasting time.  You were right, we are losing money with each round. I'll accept your previous offer of 55/45, but with me getting the larger share.  Deal?",Bob,4,

52.0,48.0,"Bob, we're already down more than 15% to inflation at this point. I'm compromising to a 52/48 split. This is my final fair offer - we're both losing money with each round, and I want us to reach an agreement now. Let's settle this before we both walk away with significantly less.",Alice,5,
