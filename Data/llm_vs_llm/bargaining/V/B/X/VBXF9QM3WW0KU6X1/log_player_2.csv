"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice is offering me $200,000 out of the $1,000,000, which means she would get $800,000.

If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. However, due to inflation, the total value will be worth 10% less to me (so the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $900,000 to me). For Alice, the money would be worth 20% less in the next round.

Given that Alice has a higher inflation rate than I do (20% vs 10%), I have a strategic advantage in rejecting this initial offer which heavily favors Alice. I can propose a more balanced split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I suggest a split where I receive $550,000 and you receive $450,000. This is a much more fair division than your initial offer, and it recognizes that we both face inflation penalties if we continue to negotiate. Since your inflation rate is higher (20% vs my 10%), it's in your interest to accept a reasonable offer now rather than continuing to future rounds where your potential gains would decrease more rapidly than mine."
