"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose this split because it's close to equal but gives me a small advantage as the first mover. It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting rather than moving to the next round where the total amount will be reduced by 5%."
