"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice is offering me $45 while she takes $55. 

If I reject this offer, we'll go to the next round where I can make a counter-proposal. However, due to inflation, the money will be worth 10% less to me in the next round. This means the $100 would effectively be worth $90 to me.

If I make a counter-offer in the next round, I could propose a more favorable split for myself. However, even if I asked for more than $45, the 10% inflation would reduce its value. For example, if I asked for $60 in the next round, it would be worth $54 to me due to inflation.

Given that:
1. The current offer gives me $45
2. Inflation will reduce the value of any future gains
3. Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation

I think this is a reasonable first offer.
