"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game rules. I need to consider the declining value of the money for both of us as the rounds progress. My goal is to maximize my gain while ensuring Bob accepts the offer, avoiding the risk of getting nothing after 12 rounds.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

My reasoning:

*   **Slightly Favorable to Alice:** I'm starting with a slight advantage to try and secure a good initial share.
*   **Reasonable Offer:** $45 is a reasonable amount for Bob to receive in the first round, especially considering the potential for losing value in later rounds.
*   **Chance of Acceptance:** This offer gives Bob a worthwhile amount that he will hopefully accept, so that we don't lose money."
