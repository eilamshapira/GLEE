"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $10,000. Since we have 12 rounds to reach an agreement, and Bob's money loses 10% value each round, I should consider a fair proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money, which I believe is fair for both of us. This way we can both walk away with a significant amount without risking further negotiation rounds where the total value diminishes."
