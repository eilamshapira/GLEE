"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I suggest this division where I receive $550,000 and Bob receives $450,000. This is a reasonable first offer that gives me a slight advantage while still offering Bob a substantial portion. Given that inflation affects me by 20% each round, I want to reach an agreement quickly, but I also need to leave room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see Bob wants a larger share. Given the inflation affecting both of us (though at different rates), I'll adjust my offer to find a middle ground.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split of $500,000 each. This is a fair compromise that recognizes we're both losing value with each passing round. Since inflation affects me more severely (20% per round vs. Bob's 10%), it's in my interest to reach an agreement soon, and this equal division should be appealing to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice Bob keeps pushing for a larger share, but with inflation significantly impacting both of us (me more than Bob), it's becoming urgent to reach an agreement. I'll make a more accommodating offer.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I propose I receive $450,000 and Bob receives $550,000. This matches Bob's first offer to me, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. Given that my money is now worth nearly 50% less than at the start, and we're both losing value with each round, accepting this division would be beneficial for both of us rather than continuing to negotiate."
