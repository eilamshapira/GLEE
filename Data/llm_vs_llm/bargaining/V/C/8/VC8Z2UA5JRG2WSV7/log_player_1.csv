"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept, considering the 20% inflation per round for me. If we go to the next round, the total value will only be worth $8,000 to me, so I should offer Bob a fair amount now.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which is $5,000 for each of us. This is a fair division that respects both our interests equally."
