"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, offering slightly more to Bob to incentivize acceptance and avoid inflation penalties.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I propose that Bob gets $550,000 and I get $450,000. This way, Bob gets a favorable deal which should encourage him to accept, and I avoid the 10% inflation penalty that would occur if we move to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 425000 
# Bob gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept, I'll get $425,000 with 10% inflation, so effectively $382,500
- If I reject, we go to next round where my money will be worth 20% less than original value
- Bob's offer gives him a larger share but it's somewhat reasonable given my weakening position
- Rejecting might lead to even worse offers as my negotiating power decreases with each round

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's less than my initial proposal, the inflation effect means delaying further would likely result in an even worse outcome for me."
