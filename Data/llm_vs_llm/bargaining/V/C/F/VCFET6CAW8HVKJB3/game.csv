5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a division in which I receive $5500 and you receive $4500. Given the limited number of rounds and the potential inflation uncertainty, I'd like us to agree quickly on this fair and efficient split. Let me know if you accept!",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I think a fair split would be $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This way, both of us still gain from the division. Let’s agree on this!",Bob,2,

5187.0,4813.0,"Hi Bob, in round 3, considering that the money you receive is now worth 20% less than its nominal value, I propose that I get $5187 and you get $4813. This gives you an effective value of about $3850 if you accept today. Waiting until round 4 would further worsen the discount on your share, so I believe this is a fair, pragmatic offer for both of us. Looking forward to your response.",Alice,3,
