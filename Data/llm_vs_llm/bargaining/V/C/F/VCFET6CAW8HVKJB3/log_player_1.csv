"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a division in which I receive $5,500 and you receive $4,500. Given the limited number of rounds and the potential inflation uncertainty, I'd like us to agree quickly on this fair and efficient split. Let me know if you accept!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I think a fair split would be $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This way, both of us still gain from the division. Let’s agree on this! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but I believe I can secure a better outcome by proposing a division in the next round. I’m going to reject this proposal.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5187, ""bob_gain"": 4813, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in round 3, considering that the money you receive is now worth 20% less than its nominal value, I propose that I get $5,187 and you get $4,813. This gives you an effective value of about $3,850 if you accept today. Waiting until round 4 would further worsen the discount on your share, so I believe this is a fair, pragmatic offer for both of us. Looking forward to your response.""}"
