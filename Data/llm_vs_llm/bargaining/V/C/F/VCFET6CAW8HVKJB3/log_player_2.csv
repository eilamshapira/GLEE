"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a division in which I receive $5500 and you receive $4500. Given the limited number of rounds and the potential inflation uncertainty, I'd like us to agree quickly on this fair and efficient split. Let me know if you accept! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I think a fair split would be $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This way, both of us still gain from the division. Letâ€™s agree on this!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 3, considering that the money you receive is now worth 20% less than its nominal value, I propose that I get $5187 and you get $4813. This gives you an effective value of about $3850 if you accept today. Waiting until round 4 would further worsen the discount on your share, so I believe this is a fair, pragmatic offer for both of us. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob gain: 4813 
# Alice gain: 5187 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
