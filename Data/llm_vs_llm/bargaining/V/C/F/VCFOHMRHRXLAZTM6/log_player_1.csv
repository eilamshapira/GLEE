Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round that passes costs me since my money depreciates by 5%. To avoid unnecessary loss and lengthy negotiations, I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor. Settling now is mutually beneficialâ€”let's conclude the game and both secure our shares before further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
