"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since inflation affects me by 10% each round, this fair division gives you a substantial portion while allowing us to conclude quickly without losing value to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 45-55 split. I believe this accommodates both of our needs while still allowing us to conclude the game quickly to mitigate inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
