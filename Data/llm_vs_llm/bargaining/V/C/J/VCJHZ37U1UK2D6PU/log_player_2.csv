"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. With inflation affecting each round, it's in both our interests to agree quickly. This gives us both the maximum value. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. If I reject, next round I can make an offer, but:
   - The money will be worth 5% less to me
   - $5000 now > $5000 * 0.95 = $4750 next round
3. Even if I try to negotiate for more in the next round, the inflation penalty makes it risky
4. A 50-50 split is generally considered fair
5. Getting the full value now is better than risking value loss

Since this is a fair offer and any delay will cost me money due to inflation, I should accept.
