"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my offer for Round 1.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I'm facing inflation with each round, I need to secure a reasonable amount early. This division gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that I have more urgency to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
