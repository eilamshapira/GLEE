"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the rapid decrease in value, especially for you, I believe this split is more equitable considering future rounds. Let's settle this now before it devalues further. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
