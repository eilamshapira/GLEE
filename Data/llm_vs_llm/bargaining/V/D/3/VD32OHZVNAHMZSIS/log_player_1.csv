"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer for Round 1.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a slightly favorable split for me, but still giving Bob a substantial portion. Since Bob faces a higher inflation penalty (10% vs my 5%), he has more incentive to accept an early offer rather than extending the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 53, ""bob_gain"": 47}

I'm adjusting my offer to be a bit more favorable to Bob compared to my first proposal. Given that we're now in round 3, both of us are facing increasing inflation penalties (my money is now worth 10% less and Bob's is worth 20% less than at the start). This more balanced split should be more attractive to Bob while still giving me a fair portion."
