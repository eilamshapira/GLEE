"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which might seem fair at first glance. However, with the 5% inflation penalty per round, I have an advantage in accepting earlier rather than later. If I reject, my next offer would be worth 5% less to me.

The current offer gives me $500,000 at full value. If I reject and we go another round, even if I get a better percentage, the total value will be worth 5% less to me. I would need to secure significantly more than $500,000 to make up for this loss.

Given the time pressure (12 rounds maximum), the fair initial split, and the inflation penalty, I should accept this offer.
