"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a 60-40 split. It's a fair offer to build on. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, keeping $60 for herself. While this isn't an even split, there are a few considerations:

1. I can reject and make a counter-offer in the next round
2. However, there's uncertainty about how inflation affects Alice's position
3. $40 is a substantial portion and not an unfair opening offer
4. Getting a guaranteed $40 now might be better than risking future rounds

Given these factors, I think this offer is reasonable enough to accept. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of a worse outcome in future rounds makes this an acceptable deal.
