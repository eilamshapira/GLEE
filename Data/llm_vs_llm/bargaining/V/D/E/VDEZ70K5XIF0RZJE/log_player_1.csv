"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll need to think strategically about this. With a 5% inflation impact on each round, it's better to end this sooner rather than later for me. However, I don't know how inflation affects Bob, which creates uncertainty.

Let me make a fair initial offer that has a good chance of being accepted:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50}

This is an equal split which is fair and has the best chance of being accepted immediately. If Bob rejects this, I'll need to consider that he might be willing to take the inflation hit for a better deal in the next round."
