"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less next round
3. Next round I could make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject
4. $400,000 is a substantial amount, even if not exactly fair
5. With inflation risk and limited rounds, accepting a good offer early might be wise
6. $400,000 now is better than potentially less later or nothing if we can't agree
