"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 7917 
# Alice gain: 2083 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $7,917 (79.17% of the total)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less to me next round
4. $7,917 now is better than a potentially higher nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation

This is actually a very generous offer from Alice. Given that my inflation rate is 5%, and I'm getting nearly 80% of the total amount, it would be risky to reject this and try for more.
