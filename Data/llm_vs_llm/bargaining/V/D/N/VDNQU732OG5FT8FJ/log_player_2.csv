"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this:

1. Current offer is $450,000 for me
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 20% less to me
4. If I reject, my $450,000 today would be worth equivalent to $360,000 next round
5. This means I would need to secure at least $562,500 next round to match the current offer's value ($450,000)
6. That might be difficult to achieve since Alice would need to accept my counter-offer

Given this analysis, the current offer of $450,000 is quite reasonable. While it's slightly less than half, the risk of inflation makes it better to accept now rather than negotiate further.
