"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my offer for the division of the $1,000,000, taking into account the inflation penalty I'll face if we have to go to additional rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it gives both of us a significant portion of the money, with me receiving slightly more. Given that I face 10% inflation per round, there's an incentive for me to reach an agreement quickly, but I still want to ensure I receive a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation pressure I face. Let me make a more strategic counter-offer.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an even 50-50 split, which is completely fair and would end our negotiation. At this point, accepting this deal would give me $500,000 which is worth $450,000 to me due to the 10% inflation from round 1. If we continue to another round, any amount would be worth even less to me, so this is a reasonable compromise that benefits us both."
