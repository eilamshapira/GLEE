550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a substantial $450000, which is 45% of the total. Since inflation affects me by 20% each round, accepting now is advantageous for both of us rather than dragging this on and diminishing the overall value.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the 20% inflation, I believe an equal split won't be fair for me in the next rounds. I'm offering you $400000, which is still a significant amount. Accepting now would be beneficial for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, I appreciate your offer but need to account for my inflation penalty. With 20% inflation each round, my $520000 now is worth only $416000 in real value to me (after the 20% inflation from rounds 1-2). This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our positions, and I've increased your share from my initial offer.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, considering the significant impact of inflation on my end, I've increased my share to $650000. Your $350000 is still a considerable amount, and accepting now would be wise, given the rapidly diminishing value of the money.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, let's be fair and end this now with a 50-50 split. With the compounding inflation I'm facing (nearly 60% by now), my $500000 is worth much less to me in real terms. This is my final compromise offer - we both walk away with equal nominal amounts, though mine is significantly devalued due to inflation. Further delays will only reduce both our outcomes.",Alice,5,
