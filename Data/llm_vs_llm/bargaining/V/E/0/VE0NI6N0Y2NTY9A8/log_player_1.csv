"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer for the first round, considering the inflation factor.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a substantial $450,000, which is 45% of the total. Since inflation affects me by 20% each round, accepting now is advantageous for both of us rather than dragging this on and diminishing the overall value.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the 20% inflation, I believe an equal split won't be fair for me in the next rounds. I'm offering you $400000, which is still a significant amount. Accepting now would be beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but need to account for my inflation penalty. With 20% inflation each round, my $520,000 now is worth only $416,000 in real value to me (after the 20% inflation from rounds 1-2). This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our positions, and I've increased your share from my initial offer.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the significant impact of inflation on my end, I've increased my share to $650000. Your $350000 is still a considerable amount, and accepting now would be wise, given the rapidly diminishing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000

This is my final compromise offer - we both walk away with equal nominal amounts, though mine is significantly devalued due to inflation. Further delays will only reduce both our outcomes.""
