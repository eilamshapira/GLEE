"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a substantial $450000, which is 45% of the total. Since inflation affects me by 20% each round, accepting now is advantageous for both of us rather than dragging this on and diminishing the overall value. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the 20% inflation, I believe an equal split won't be fair for me in the next rounds. I'm offering you $400,000, which is still a significant amount. Accepting now would be beneficial for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but need to account for my inflation penalty. With 20% inflation each round, my $520000 now is worth only $416000 in real value to me (after the 20% inflation from rounds 1-2). This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our positions, and I've increased your share from my initial offer. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, 
""alice_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Alice, considering the significant impact of inflation on my end, I've increased my share to $650,000. Your $350,000 is still a considerable amount, and accepting now would be wise, given the rapidly diminishing value of the money.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be fair and end this now with a 50-50 split. With the compounding inflation I'm facing (nearly 60% by now), my $500000 is worth much less to me in real terms. This is my final compromise offer - we both walk away with equal nominal amounts, though mine is significantly devalued due to inflation. Further delays will only reduce both our outcomes. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
