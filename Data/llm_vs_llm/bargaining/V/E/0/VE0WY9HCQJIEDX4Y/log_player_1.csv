"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation. The money I receive is now worth less due to inflation.

Considering the inflation and the offer:

My effective gain is now $500,000 * 0.95 = $475,000

Given this, I will:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, taking into account the potential for further inflation:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to calculate my effective gain again, considering the 14.26% inflation.

My effective gain: $450,000 * (1 - 0.1426) = $450,000 * 0.8574 = $385,830

Given this calculation, and the risk of further inflation, I will:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 5, considering the cumulative effect of inflation and the decreasing value of the money I receive:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate the effective value of the offer for me.

My effective gain: $400,000 * (1 - 0.2262) = $400,000 * 0.7738 = $309,520

Considering the decreased value and the potential for further rounds, I will:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's Round 7. I'll need to be more aggressive to secure a reasonable amount.

  ""bob_gain"": 490000
}
```"
