550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fair split considering our different inflation rates. If we go to the next round, the total value decreases for both of us, but especially for me. This deal gives you 45% which is generous given that a 50-50 split would be fair in a world without the inflation difference.",Alice,1,
