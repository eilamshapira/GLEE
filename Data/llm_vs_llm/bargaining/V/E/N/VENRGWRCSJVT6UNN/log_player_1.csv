"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to make a proposal to divide $1,000,000 with Bob, keeping in mind that inflation affects me more (10% per round) than it affects Bob (5% per round). This creates pressure for me to reach a deal sooner.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fair split considering our different inflation rates. If we go to the next round, the total value decreases for both of us, but especially for me. This deal gives you 45% which is generous given that a 50-50 split would be fair in a world without the inflation difference.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation rates, my offer reflects a fair adjustment from your initial proposal. Given that my money loses value at a slower rate, I believe a 55-45 split in my favor is reasonable. Let's settle this round to avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
