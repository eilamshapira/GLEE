"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fair split considering our different inflation rates. If we go to the next round, the total value decreases for both of us, but especially for me. This deal gives you 45% which is generous given that a 50-50 split would be fair in a world without the inflation difference. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation rates, my offer reflects a fair adjustment from your initial proposal. Given that my money loses value at a slower rate, I believe a 55-45 split in my favor is reasonable. Let's settle this round to avoid further devaluation.""
