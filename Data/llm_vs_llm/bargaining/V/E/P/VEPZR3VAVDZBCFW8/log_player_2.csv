"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $55 out of $100, which is more than half. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I'll face 10% inflation, meaning the entire $100 will be worth only $90 to me. My maximum possible gain would then be $90, and realistically less since I'd need to make Alice a reasonable offer.

Since $55 now is better than potentially getting a larger percentage of a smaller pie later, I'll accept this offer.
