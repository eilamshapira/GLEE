"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting this is a fair starting point. Your turn to respond as Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, 55/45 is fairer! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $450,000, but its value will be 20% less than its original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $450,000 * 0.8 = $360,000.

Since Bob's offer is not very favorable to me, and I still have a chance to make a counteroffer in the next round, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than in Round 1, and another 20% less than in Round 2, which means it's 20% * 2 = 40% less than the original value (1 - 0.2 = 0.8, 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64, or 1 - 0.36 = 0.64, 64% of original value, or 36% less). However, considering the two rounds that have passed, I should calculate it as follows: 
Round 1: 1
Round 2: 1 * 0.8 = 0.8
Round 3: 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64

So, the money I gain is worth 64% of its original value, or 36% less.

To make my offer more attractive to Bob, I'll consider the fact that the money he gains is worth 5% less than in Round 1, and another 5% less than in Round 2, which means it's 10% less than the original value (1 - 0.05 = 0.95, 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Split it 50/50, last chance for a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the money 50/50, with a message indicating that this might be the last chance for a fair deal. Your turn to respond as Bob!"
