"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, in the next round the money will only be worth 80% of its current value
4. My $4,000 now vs. potential higher amount but worth 20% less...
5. If I get $4,000 now, that's better than getting even $5,000 in the next round (which would be worth $4,000 due to inflation)

Given the inflation penalty, I should accept this offer. While it's not a 50-50 split, the risk of losing value through inflation makes this a reasonable deal.
