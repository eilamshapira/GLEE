0.0,10000.0,"Hi Bob, given that with each passing round my share loses 10% of its value while yours does not, I’m aware that delaying only hurts me. To avoid further devaluation and because you can always secure the full $10000 by waiting until your turn, I’m proposing you receive the entire $10000 right now. I hope you’ll agree to settle immediately so we can both wrap this up without any losses.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your point about devaluation, so I want to make this fair for both of us. I'm offering $4500 for you, which is slightly lower than half because of the difference in round impact. I hope you'll consider accepting this so we both walk away with a good share.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for your proposal. Given that waiting further would only shrink my share even more, I believe that locking in $4500 nominal (which is worth $4050 to me in present value) is the best outcome I can secure at this stage. I accept your offer.",Alice,2,accept
