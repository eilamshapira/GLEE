"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 10000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, given that with each passing round my share loses 10% of its value while yours does not, I’m aware that delaying only hurts me. To avoid further devaluation and because you can always secure the full $10,000 by waiting until your turn, I’m proposing you receive the entire $10,000 right now. I hope you’ll agree to settle immediately so we can both wrap this up without any losses.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about devaluation, so I want to make this fair for both of us. I'm offering $4500 for you, which is slightly lower than half because of the difference in round impact. I hope you'll consider accepting this so we both walk away with a good share. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your proposal. Given that waiting further would only shrink my share even more, I believe that locking in $4500 nominal (which is worth $4050 to me in present value) is the best outcome I can secure at this stage. I accept your offer.""}"
