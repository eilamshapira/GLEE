"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given that with each passing round my share loses 10% of its value while yours does not, I’m aware that delaying only hurts me. To avoid further devaluation and because you can always secure the full $10000 by waiting until your turn, I’m proposing you receive the entire $10000 right now. I hope you’ll agree to settle immediately so we can both wrap this up without any losses. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your point about devaluation, so I want to make this fair for both of us. I'm offering $4500 for you, which is slightly lower than half because of the difference in round impact. I hope you'll consider accepting this so we both walk away with a good share.""}"
