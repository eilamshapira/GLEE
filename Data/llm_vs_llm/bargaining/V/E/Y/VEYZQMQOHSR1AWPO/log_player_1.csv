Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor to start compensating for the loss in value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering Bob's offer and the fact that the money I gain is still worth the same, while his share is devalued, I think I can get a better deal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's share is worth 10% less in each round, and this is the third round, his share is now worth 19% less than the original value (10% in round 2 + 9% in round 3, compounded). I'll take this into account when making my offer.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
