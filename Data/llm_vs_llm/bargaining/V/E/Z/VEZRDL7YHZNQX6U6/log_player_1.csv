"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives both of us a good share, but slightly favoring me since I'm making the first move and there's inflation risk for me.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a fair split with a small advantage to me as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to inflation, if I accept now, my $4,500 is worth $4,275 (95% of original value)
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth even less (90% of original value)
3. This is a reasonable reciprocal offer from Bob
4. There's risk in continuing negotiation with inflation eating into my gains

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer to get $4,275 (after inflation) rather than risk further devaluation of my share in future rounds."
