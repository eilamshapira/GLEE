"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move. This is a fair offer considering you get a substantial portion. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer of a 60-40 split in her favor.

If I accept now, I get $40.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total money will be worth 5% less (only $95 total). Even if I were to propose a more favorable split for myself, I need to consider that Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

Given the diminishing value with each round and the reasonable portion offered, I'll accept this offer.
