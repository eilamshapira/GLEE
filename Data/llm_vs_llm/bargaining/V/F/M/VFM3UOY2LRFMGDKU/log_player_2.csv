"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly with a slight advantage to me. This way, we both get a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me after each round, I'll make a reasonable offer to Alice. Considering the inflation effect, I'll propose a split that's slightly in my favor to account for the potential loss of value.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly, considering the decreasing value over time. This offer gives us both a significant amount, but I need a bit more to compensate for the inflation effect on my side.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the impact of inflation. Let's meet in the middle. This offer should be fair considering the decreasing value of money. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual value I'd get from Alice's offer is 450000 * 0.81 (since it's 19% less than the original value) = 364500.

Given that the money is decreasing in value rapidly, and Alice's offer is not extremely unfavorable, I'll accept it to avoid further losses due to inflation.
