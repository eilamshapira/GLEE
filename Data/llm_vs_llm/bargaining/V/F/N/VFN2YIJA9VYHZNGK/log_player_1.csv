"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Alice, and I need to propose a division of $1,000,000 to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation impact in later rounds.

Here's my offer for Round 1, focusing on securing a significant portion for myself right away, understanding Bob's money depreciates faster.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Let's analyze this.

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice gets $400,000, and Bob gets $600,000.
*   **Inflation:** My money is worth the same, but Bob's $600,000 is only worth 90% of what it would have been in round 1, so it's really worth $540,000 to him.

I initially offered Bob $100,000, and he rejected it. Now he's offering me $400,000. The situation is still favorable to me if he rejects again.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. Let's consider the situation. This is Round 3.

*   **My Money:** Still worth the same.
*   **Bob's Money:** Now worth 81% (90% of 90%) of its original value.

I need to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept, given the diminishing value of his share. However, I also want to maximize my gains.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this offer from Bob in Round 4.

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice gets $450,000, Bob gets $550,000.
*   **Inflation:** Bob's money is worth 27.1% less than round 1. $550,000 * (1 - 0.271) = $550,000 * 0.729 = $400,950

Compared to my initial ask of $900,000, this is still quite a loss for me. However, I'm conscious that we are on round 4, and Bob's money is decreasing. If he rejects again, it might be a better offer for me.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, Round 5. Let's reassess.

*   **My Money:** Still constant value.
*   **Bob's Money:** Now worth only 59.05% (0.9^4 * 100) of the original value. It's depreciated significantly.

I've been playing somewhat aggressively, but I need to make an offer Bob will likely accept, given the rapid depreciation of his potential gains. He might be desperate to avoid further loss.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alright, Round 6. Bob is offering a 50/50 split.

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice gets $500,000, Bob gets $500,000.
*   **Inflation:** Bob's money is now worth 40.95% less. $500,000 * (1-0.4095) = $500,000 * 0.5905 = $295,250

I initially wanted $900,000, then asked for 650,000, and then offered 550,000. The round is getting quite high, so let's take it.

```json

  ""decision"": ""accept""
