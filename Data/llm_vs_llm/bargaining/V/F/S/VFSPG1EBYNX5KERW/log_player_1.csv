"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to consider the decreasing value of the money each round due to inflation. Since this is Round 1 and I'm Alice, I'll make a proposal that favors me slightly, but is still reasonable enough for Bob to accept, given the rapidly approaching deadline.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

Explanation:

*   I'm asking for $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000.
*   I believe this offer gives me a slight advantage, but isn't so greedy that Bob would automatically reject it and risk further devaluation of the money. This leaves room for negotiation in later rounds if necessary.

I'm ready for Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Let's analyze the situation.

*   **Bob's offer:** Alice gets $450,000, Bob gets $550,000.
*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 20% less than in round 1, and Bob's is worth 5% less.
*   **Goal:** To maximize my gain while ensuring a deal is reached before the 12-round deadline.

Let's calculate the relative value. In round 1, $600,000 was my goal. With 20% devaluation, in round 2 I would need $600,000 * .8 = $480,000. Bob's money only devalues by 5%, so Bob's $550,000 would only be worth $522,500.

Given the limited number of rounds and the continued devaluation of the money, rejecting this offer is too risky. I will accept.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
