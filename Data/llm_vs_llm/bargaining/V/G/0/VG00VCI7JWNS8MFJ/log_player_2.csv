Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While I could try to negotiate for more, a 50-50 split is completely fair and reasonable. There's no guarantee that I could get a better deal in subsequent rounds, and we risk getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds. This is a fair offer that benefits both parties equally."
