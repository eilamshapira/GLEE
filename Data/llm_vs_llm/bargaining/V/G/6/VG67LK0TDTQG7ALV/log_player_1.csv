"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, proposing an equal split since it's likely to be accepted and avoids prolonging negotiations.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose we split the money equally - $5,000 each. This is a fair and equitable division that gives us both a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob is offering me $4500, which is worth exactly $4500 to me
2. Bob wants $5500, but due to 5% inflation, it's actually worth $5225 to him
3. His total proposal ($10,000) preserves most value
4. If I reject, we go to another round where I can make an offer, but Bob's value will decrease further
5. While this offer gives me less than my initial proposal, it's still a substantial amount and further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes due to inflation
