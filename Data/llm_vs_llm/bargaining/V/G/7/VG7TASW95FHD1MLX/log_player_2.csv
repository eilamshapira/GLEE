"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether accepting this offer now is better than potentially getting a better offer in the next round, given the 20% inflation effect on my share.

If I reject now, in the next round, the total value for me will be worth 8000$ (80% of 10,000$). If I make a fairer offer then, like a 5000/5000 split, I would get 5000$ but it would be worth only 4000$ to me due to inflation.

The current offer gives me 4000$ right now. If I reject and counter-offer, I might not do much better after accounting for inflation, and Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation.
