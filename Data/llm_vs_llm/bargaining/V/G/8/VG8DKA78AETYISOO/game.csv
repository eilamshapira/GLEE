525000.0,475000.0,"Let's be fair, Bob. I know I'm losing out with inflation, so how about a slight advantage for me in this round?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I recognize the inflation penalty you face each round. To avoid further discounting of your share, I'm offering you a solid 400000$ (nominal) now. Accepting this offer means you secure your funds at a higher effective value than waiting another round. Let's settle this now peacefully.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
446250.0,553750.0,"Bob, I appreciate your attempt at fairness, but the deal still needs to be better for me. I'm willing to be reasonable, but I need you to meet me halfway.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
360000.0,640000.0,"Alice, we both know that every extra round chips away at the real value of your share—you’d face an effective 14.26% loss (since 0.95³ ≈ 0.8574) if we prolong this any further. By settling now, you secure a nominal 360000$, which translates to roughly 308655$ in real value. I believe this division reflects the urgency and the cost of delay for you, while still giving me a fair cut. Let’s end this now before further inflation diminishes our gains.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
410781.25,589218.75,"Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains. I'm proposing a solution where we split the difference between our last two offers.  This reflects the time pressure I'm under while still acknowledging your position. Let's close this out fairly.",Alice,5,
,,"Alice, while your proposal gives me quite a robust nominal amount, I believe that waiting another round lets me improve my position even further. Your 410781.25 isn’t reflective of the true effective value you'll receive after further rounds, and as the proposer in the next round, I can craft an offer that's even more in my favor. Let's continue to negotiate—I'm confident we can settle on terms that better reflect the time-sensitive realities of our situation.",Bob,5,reject
320000.0,680000.0,"Alice, every extra round chips away at your effective gains—by waiting, you'll be saddled with even steeper losses. In this round, I'm offering you 320000 dollars nominal, which, at current inflation (about 22.62% degradation), comes to roughly 247600 in real value. Accepting now spares you further erosion. Let's settle this before conditions worsen.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
365500.0,634500.0,"Bob, this is my final offer. It's clear you're aiming for a larger share, but I need you to acknowledge the significant losses I'm incurring with each round. Let's end this now and avoid any further complications.",Alice,7,
,,"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but it's clear that if we continue, your share's real value will be eroded even further. As you know, my funds remain unaffected by inflation while yours depreciate more with each round. By rejecting this round, I'll be in a position to craft a proposal that, while it might nominally lower your share, actually reflects a fairer deal considering the circumstances. I'm confident that moving forward will allow us both to settle on terms more in line with the reality of the situation.",Bob,7,reject
280000.0,720000.0,"Alice, as we step into round 8, your funds have now lost roughly 30% of their original value. I know this is steep, but any further delay will only compound the loss. By accepting my proposal of a nominal $280000 for you, you preserve more of your effective value than risking another round. Let's settle now rather than erode your share further.",Bob,8,
