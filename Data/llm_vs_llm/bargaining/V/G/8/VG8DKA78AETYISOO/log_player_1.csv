"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I recognize the inflation penalty you face each round. To avoid further discounting of your share, I'm offering you a solid 400000$ (nominal) now. Accepting this offer means you secure your funds at a higher effective value than waiting another round. Let's settle this now peacefully.

# Bob gain: 600000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we both know that every extra round chips away at the real value of your share—you’d face an effective 14.26% loss (since 0.95³ ≈ 0.8574) if we prolong this any further. By settling now, you secure a nominal 360000$, which translates to roughly 308655$ in real value. I believe this division reflects the urgency and the cost of delay for you, while still giving me a fair cut. Let’s end this now before further inflation diminishes our gains. 
# Alice gain: 360000 
# Bob gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is using a combination of persuasive language and slightly misleading math to pressure me into accepting a low offer. 

* **Misleading Math:** While he's technically correct about the 14.26% overall loss, he's framing it as if I'm losing that much *in addition* to the round-by-round decrease. He's trying to make the loss seem steeper than it is.
* **Pressure Tactic:**  He's emphasizing the ""urgency"" and ""cost of delay"" to make me feel like I have to accept a bad deal now.

I need to hold my ground. Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. While I am losing value, he's not offering a fair split considering the potential gains he's getting by waiting me out."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 410781.25,
""bob_gain"": 589218.75,
""message"": ""Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains. I'm proposing a solution where we split the difference between our last two offers.  This reflects the time pressure I'm under while still acknowledging your position. Let's close this out fairly.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. It's a significant move from my previous offer but still ensures I'm not accepting a drastically reduced amount. 
* **Clarity:** By explicitly stating this offer splits the difference, I'm removing any ambiguity and demonstrating fairness. 
* **Finality:** The tone suggests this is my final attempt at a compromise, encouraging Bob to accept and avoid further losses on both sides."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every extra round chips away at your effective gains—by waiting, you'll be saddled with even steeper losses. In this round, I'm offering you 320000 dollars nominal, which, at current inflation (about 22.62% degradation), comes to roughly 247600 in real value. Accepting now spares you further erosion. Let's settle this before conditions worsen. 
# Alice gain: 320000 
# Bob gain: 680000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is continuing his tactic of using fear and slightly misleading information. He's right that the longer this goes on, the more I lose, but his offer is still highly skewed in his favor. He's banking on me panicking and accepting a bad deal. I need to call his bluff, but I'm also running out of time."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 365500,
""bob_gain"": 634500,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. It's clear you're aiming for a larger share, but I need you to acknowledge the significant losses I'm incurring with each round. Let's end this now and avoid any further complications.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ultimatum:**  I'm making it clear that this is my last offer. This adds a sense of urgency and finality to the negotiation.
* **Concession:** I'm slightly increasing my previous offer to show Bob I'm willing to compromise, but only to a certain extent. 
* **Focus on Fairness:**  The message highlights the fairness of my position, emphasizing the losses I'm experiencing due to the game's structure. 
* **Avoiding a Stalemate:** This offer aims to prevent a stalemate where we both lose out significantly. It's a calculated risk, but one I need to take at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we step into round 8, your funds have now lost roughly 30% of their original value. I know this is steep, but any further delay will only compound the loss. By accepting my proposal of a nominal $280000 for you, you preserve more of your effective value than risking another round. Let's settle now rather than erode your share further. 
# Alice gain: 280000 
# Bob gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough pill to swallow, but Bob is right. The longer this drags on, the less I get. He's clearly playing hardball, and I don't think he'll budge from this point. Accepting now might sting, but it's better than risking an even lower offer in the next round."
