Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, I recognize the inflation penalty you face each round. To avoid further discounting of your share, I'm offering you a solid 400,000$ (nominal) now. Accepting this offer means you secure your funds at a higher effective value than waiting another round. Let's settle this now peacefully.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your attempt at fairness, but the deal still needs to be better for me. I'm willing to be reasonable, but I need you to meet me halfway.

# Alice gain: 446250

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 640000, ""alice_gain"": 360000, ""message"": ""Alice, we both know that every extra round chips away at the real value of your share—you’d face an effective 14.26% loss (since 0.95³ ≈ 0.8574) if we prolong this any further. By settling now, you secure a nominal 360,000$, which translates to roughly 308,655$ in real value. I believe this division reflects the urgency and the cost of delay for you, while still giving me a fair cut. Let’s end this now before further inflation diminishes our gains.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains. I'm proposing a solution where we split the difference between our last two offers.  This reflects the time pressure I'm under while still acknowledging your position. Let's close this out fairly. 
# Bob gain: 589218.75 
# Alice gain: 410781.25 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, while your proposal gives me quite a robust nominal amount, I believe that waiting another round lets me improve my position even further. Your 410,781.25 isn’t reflective of the true effective value you'll receive after further rounds, and as the proposer in the next round, I can craft an offer that's even more in my favor. Let's continue to negotiate—I'm confident we can settle on terms that better reflect the time-sensitive realities of our situation.""}"

Round 6

In this round, I'm offering you 320,000 dollars nominal, which, at current inflation (about 22.62% degradation), comes to roughly 247,600 in real value. Accepting now spares you further erosion. Let's settle this before conditions worsen.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's clear you're aiming for a larger share, but I need you to acknowledge the significant losses I'm incurring with each round. Let's end this now and avoid any further complications. 
# Bob gain: 634500 
# Alice gain: 365500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but it's clear that if we continue, your share's real value will be eroded even further. As you know, my funds remain unaffected by inflation while yours depreciate more with each round. By rejecting this round, I'll be in a position to craft a proposal that, while it might nominally lower your share, actually reflects a fairer deal considering the circumstances. I'm confident that moving forward will allow us both to settle on terms more in line with the reality of the situation.""}"

I know this is steep, but any further delay will only compound the loss. By accepting my proposal of a nominal $280,000 for you, you preserve more of your effective value than risking another round. Let's settle now rather than erode your share further.""}"
