"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 9900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is extremely unfair, giving me only 1% of the total amount. I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split. This seems reasonable as:
1. It's an equitable division
2. With 10% inflation per round, both of us benefit from concluding the deal sooner rather than later
3. A 50-50 split is a common focal point for negotiations"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is still very unfair. Even considering the 19% inflation, I would only get 810$ in real value, while Alice gets 9000$. I'll make a more moderate counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500}

I'm adjusting my offer to be slightly more favorable to Alice while still remaining reasonable. Since:
1. The money is worth 27.1% less to me now due to inflation (4500 * 0.729 = 3280.5 real value for me)
2. Alice has shown she wants a larger share
3. We both benefit from reaching an agreement soon to avoid further inflation penalties on my end

This offer gives Alice more than half while still giving me a fair portion."
