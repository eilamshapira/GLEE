100.0,0.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I claim the $100 today and you get $0. Remember, with every extra round you lose 5% of the value, so delaying only hurts your outcome. Accept now and we both conserve our resources.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, let's split it evenly.  We both get a fair share, and we don't have to risk the value decreasing in future rounds.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate the fair‐split sentiment, but considering that your share will further devalue with each round while mine remains constant, I'd prefer to continue the game. Let’s move to the next round and see what we can work out!",Alice,2,reject
45.0,55.0,"Bob, I know the longer we wait the more you lose from inflation. In this round, your $55 will be worth about $49.50 in today's terms, which beats the further devaluation if we postpone any further. I believe this is a fair deal that benefits both of us—please accept and let's settle now.",Alice,3,
