"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 100, ""bob_gain"": 0, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I claim the $100 today and you get $0. Remember, with every extra round you lose 5% of the value, so delaying only hurts your outcome. Accept now and we both conserve our resources.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split it evenly.  We both get a fair share, and we don't have to risk the value decreasing in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the fair‐split sentiment, but considering that your share will further devalue with each round while mine remains constant, I'd prefer to continue the game. Let’s move to the next round and see what we can work out!""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Bob, I know the longer we wait the more you lose from inflation. In this round, your $55 will be worth about $49.50 in today's terms, which beats the further devaluation if we postpone any further. I believe this is a fair deal that benefits both of us—please accept and let's settle now.""}"
