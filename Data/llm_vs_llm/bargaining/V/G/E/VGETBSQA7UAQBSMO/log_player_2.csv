"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I claim the $100 today and you get $0. Remember, with every extra round you lose 5% of the value, so delaying only hurts your outcome. Accept now and we both conserve our resources. 
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's split it evenly.  We both get a fair share, and we don't have to risk the value decreasing in future rounds.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I know the longer we wait the more you lose from inflation. In this round, your $55 will be worth about $49.50 in today's terms, which beats the further devaluation if we postpone any further. I believe this is a fair deal that benefits both of usâ€”please accept and let's settle now. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
