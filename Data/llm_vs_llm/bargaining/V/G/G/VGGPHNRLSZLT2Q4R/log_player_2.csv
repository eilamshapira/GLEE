Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Let's confirm the final values considering inflation:
- My gain: 4800 * 0.5904 = 2833.92
- Alice's gain: 5200 * 0.6561 = 3411.72

This seems like a fair deal given the inflation rates."
