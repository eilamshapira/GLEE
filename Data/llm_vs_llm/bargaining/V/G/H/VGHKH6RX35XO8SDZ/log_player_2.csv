"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game and the decreasing value of the money. Here's my offer for Round 2:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm offering a slightly better split for myself, hoping to find a middle ground that Alice will accept, considering the value is diminishing each round."
