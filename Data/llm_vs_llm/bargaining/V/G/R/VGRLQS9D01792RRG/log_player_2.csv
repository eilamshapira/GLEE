"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose a split of 80/20 in my favor. Let's end this quickly and take the deal! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer. I would get $200,000 in the first round. Since the money's worth decreases 10% for me with each round, I need to consider future rounds and potential offers from me. If I reject this, it will be my turn to make an offer. I will need to offer Alice at least $800,000 (since it is what she will gain if I accept now) to make sure she accepts. With the money being worth less for me in the next round, and with the need to make sure Alice gets a deal she wants, I am better off accepting this offer and getting $200,000.
