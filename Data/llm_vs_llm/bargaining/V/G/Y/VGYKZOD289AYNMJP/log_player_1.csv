"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make a strategic offer, considering the 5% inflation penalty for each round. I should aim for a fair split with a slight advantage to me since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I suggest we split the million with me taking $550,000 and you receiving $450,000. This is a fair first offer that gives us both substantial amounts, with slightly more for me as the first mover. The 5% inflation penalty means we should try to reach an agreement quickly, so I hope you'll find this acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the impact of inflation. If I accept now, I get $500,000 with 5% less value, which is effectively $475,000 in round 1 value. If I reject and we go to round 3, any amount I get will be worth 10% less than round 1 value. Since Bob is offering an equal split, which is fair, and the inflation penalty will only increase with more rounds, I should accept.
