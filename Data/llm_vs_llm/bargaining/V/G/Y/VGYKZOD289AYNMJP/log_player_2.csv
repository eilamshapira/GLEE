"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer seems reasonable, but I should consider if it's optimal given the 5% inflation per round. If I reject and make a counteroffer next round, the total amount will be worth 5% less to me. Let me evaluate:

If I accept now, I get $450,000.
If I reject and propose next round, I'd aim for more, but the entire pot would be worth 5% less to me, so I'd need to get more than $450,000/0.95 = $473,684 to come out ahead.

Since this is just the first round and we have many rounds left, I believe I can make a better counteroffer. The split is not too far from 50-50, but I think I can negotiate for a more favorable division.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split that still gives Alice a good portion while improving my position.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split, which I believe is fair to both of us. This gives us each half a million dollars."
