"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me since I'm first, but fair enough that Bob should accept given the inflation penalty.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable split considering Bob faces higher inflation (20%) than I do (10%) if he rejects, and we both risk getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept, I get $50 worth 90% of original value = $45
- If I reject, next round will have further inflation (my money worth 80% and Bob's 60%)
- Bob's offering an equal split, which is fair
- Better to secure a good deal early than risk further devaluation

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer.
