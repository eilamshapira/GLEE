"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With a 5% decrease per round in value for me, waiting could be risky. A $500,000 offer now is better than a potentially higher offer later that would be worth less due to inflation.

Let's calculate: If I reject and propose something more favorable next round, even if I got $600,000, it would be worth $570,000 (after 5% inflation). The risk of further negotiations and value loss doesn't seem worth it.

$500,000 is a fair split, and I'm guaranteed to get it now without any inflation impact.
