"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob, considering that money is worth less in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering that if we delay, the total amount becomes less valuable for both of us, with Bob's discount rate being higher than mine. Since Bob loses value faster (20% vs my 10% per round), he has more incentive to accept a reasonable offer now rather than waiting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. This is exactly the same split I proposed in round 1 (60-40), and since we're now in round 2, the actual value to me is less due to the 10% inflation on my portion. There's no advantage in rejecting and moving to another round where the money would be worth even less for both of us."
