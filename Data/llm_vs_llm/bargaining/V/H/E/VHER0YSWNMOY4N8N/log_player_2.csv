Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, the effective amount is $100 * 0.8 = $80. For Alice, it's $100 * 0.9 = $90.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the effective amounts.
