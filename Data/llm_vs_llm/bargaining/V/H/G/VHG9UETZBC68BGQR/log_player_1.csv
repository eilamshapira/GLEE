Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, let's factor in the inflation and try to make an offer that's more appealing to Bob, but still beneficial to me considering the dwindling value.

Since it's round 3, my money is now worth 10% less (5% * 2 rounds) and Bob's money is worth 20% less (10% * 2 rounds). This means $1 for me is worth $0.90 and $1 for Bob is worth $0.80, relative to the initial value. I will take that into consideration.
