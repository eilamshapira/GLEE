"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000.

Given that inflation hits me harder (10% per round vs her 5%), there's a cost to rejecting. If I reject and we go to round 2, my $4,000 would effectively be worth only $3,600 to me, while Alice's $6,000 would be worth $5,700 to her.

Since I'd have the opportunity to make a counter-offer next round, I could propose a better split for myself. However, Alice could reject my counter-offer, and we'd both continue to lose value.

This isn't a great first offer, but considering the asymmetric inflation penalty, I'll reject and make a counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while considering our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

Given the asymmetric inflation rates that punish me more heavily if we continue negotiating (10% for me vs 5% for Alice), I'm proposing a split that favors me slightly but is still reasonable. Since inflation affects me more severely, it makes sense that I should receive a larger portion now rather than continuing to future rounds where my share would be worth less."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's new offer and the inflation effects.

Alice is now offering me $4,800 while she takes $5,200. Due to inflation, my $4,800 is worth about $3,888 in round 1 terms (after 19% inflation). If I reject and we move to round 4, inflation will reduce the value even further for both of us, but especially for me.

Alice has increased her offer from $4,000 to $4,800, showing willingness to negotiate. The split is now closer to even (48%/52%) and considering that inflation affects me more heavily, accepting now would be better than continuing to negotiate while losing value.
