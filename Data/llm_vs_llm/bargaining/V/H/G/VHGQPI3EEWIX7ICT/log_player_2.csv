"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, my money will be worth less next round
4. $40 now is better than $50 in the next round (which would be worth $40 after 20% inflation)
5. While not a perfect 50-50 split, it's a reasonable offer considering inflation
