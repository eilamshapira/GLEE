"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer. She's proposing an even 50-50 split, which gives us each $50. This is a fair division, and since we're only in round 1, we still have the full value of the money.

If I reject and propose in round 2, the total value will already be reduced by 20% to $80, meaning even if I got a larger percentage, the absolute value might be less than $50.

This is a reasonable first offer and accepting allows us to avoid the inflation penalty.
