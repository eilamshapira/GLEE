"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that future rounds will reduce the value more for me than for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I suggest a slightly higher share for me since inflation will affect me more severely in future rounds. This is a fair deal for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. This way, both of us get a fair share, and we can avoid the effects of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I'll get $50, but it's worth 20% less than in round 1, so effectively $40
- If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, the money will be worth even less (40% less than round 1 for me)
- Bob's offer is equal split, but due to different inflation rates, they're actually getting more value

Given that continuing would lead to even more value loss, and the current offer still gives me a significant amount, I'll accept.
