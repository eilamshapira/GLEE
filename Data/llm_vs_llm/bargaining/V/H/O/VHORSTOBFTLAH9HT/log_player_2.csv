"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- It's a 50-50 split, which is fair in principle
- However, since this is the first round, there's no inflation impact yet
- If I reject, I can make my own proposal next round with only a 20% depreciation
- I could potentially get a better deal by making a counter-offer
- But there's also risk in prolonging negotiations

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll try to negotiate for a slightly better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a slightly better deal for myself, but still reasonable enough that Alice might accept:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

My reasoning:
- This is a 60-40 split
- With 20% inflation, the total money is now worth $800,000
- So Alice would still get $320,000 in real value
- It's better for both of us to reach an agreement soon rather than let inflation eat away at the total
- If Alice rejects, the next round will have another 20% inflation, making us both worse off"
