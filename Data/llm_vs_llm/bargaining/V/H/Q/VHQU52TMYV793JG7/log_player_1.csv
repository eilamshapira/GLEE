"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering I want to secure a good amount but also make it attractive enough for Bob to accept, given the 5% inflation penalty per round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this division because it's reasonably balanced while giving me a slight advantage as the first mover. It shows respect for Bob's position while protecting my interests, and avoids the risk of multiple rounds where inflation would eat into both our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split
2. Due to 5% inflation, my $5000 is actually worth $4750 to me
3. If I reject, I can make a new offer next round, but the money will be worth even less (another 5% reduction)
4. We still have 10 rounds left, but each delay makes it worse for me
5. This is actually a reasonable offer considering the inflation penalty

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept because while it's not the most favorable split for me, the inflation penalty makes it better to take a fair deal now rather than risk further devaluation of my share in future rounds."
