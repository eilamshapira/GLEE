# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is 450000 * 0.81 = 364500, and Alice's share is 550000 * 0.64 = 352000.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 19% less in round 3, and now another 10% less in round 4, so it's 0.81 * 0.9 = 0.729. The money Alice gains is worth 36% less in round 3, and now another 10% less in round 4, so it's 0.64 * 0.9 = 0.576.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, and the value is decreasing. This is my final offer - a near even split to avoid us both losing out. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get is 490000 * 0.6561 = 321509, and Alice's share is 510000 * 0.4096 = 2088192 * 0.1 = 208819.2. 

Given the significant decrease in value due to inflation, a near-even split might be the best option at this point.
