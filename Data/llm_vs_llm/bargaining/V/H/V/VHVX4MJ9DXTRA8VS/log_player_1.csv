"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose a 50-50 split. I believe this is a fair offer for both of us. Let's reach an agreement and avoid inflation losses! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. Due to inflation, if I wait another round, my share would be worth even less (another 20% reduction)
2. Getting $5000 now at 20% inflation (worth $4000) is better than risking further rounds with more severe inflation
3. It's a fair 50-50 split, and waiting longer will only decrease the real value of any future gains
4. We have limited rounds, and there's no guarantee of getting a better deal later"
