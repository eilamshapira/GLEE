"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob with each passing round, I'll try to be somewhat generous to encourage Bob to accept.

Here's my offer:
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This way, I get 60% of the money, and Bob gets 40%. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's offer is now split 50/50, I need to consider the fact that Bob's share is worth 20% less to him due to inflation.

However, for me, the value remains the same. Given that Bob's offer is quite generous, and I don't want to risk losing value in future rounds, I think I'll accept this offer.
