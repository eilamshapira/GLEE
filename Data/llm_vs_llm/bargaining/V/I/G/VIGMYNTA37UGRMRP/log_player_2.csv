"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 2, considering the inflation:

Since it's my turn to propose, and the money is worth 20% less for me this round, the effective value of the $1,000,000 is unchanged for the purpose of calculation. Let's calculate the new values, taking into account the discount for me:

*   My money worth: $1,000,000 * (1-0.2) = $800,000
*   Alice's money worth: $1,000,000 * (1-0.1) = $900,000

I will offer Alice a higher percentage of the money this time.
