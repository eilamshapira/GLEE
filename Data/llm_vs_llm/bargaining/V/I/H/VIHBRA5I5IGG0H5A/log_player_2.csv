"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me $4,500 out of $10,000, which is 45% of the total.

If I reject and move to the next round:
- The money will be worth 5% less to me
- The money will be worth 10% less to Alice
- I'll get to make the next proposal

If I reject, the maximum I could get in the next round would be worth: $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500 in current value

Since $4,500 is a reasonable offer (close to 50-50 split) and waiting would reduce the value for both of us, I'll accept this offer.
