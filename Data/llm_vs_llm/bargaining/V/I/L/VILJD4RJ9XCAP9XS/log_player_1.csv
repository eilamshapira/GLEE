"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives me a slight advantage but is still fair enough that Bob might accept it.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division because:
1. It gives me a modest advantage (55%)
2. It's not too greedy and leaves Bob with a substantial amount
3. Bob might accept it rather than risk inflation effects in later rounds
4. If Bob rejects it, I can still adjust my strategy based on their counter-offer"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob's offering me $450,000, while taking $550,000 for himself
2. Due to inflation, Bob's $550,000 is actually worth $495,000 to him (90% of original value)
3. My $450,000 would still be worth the full amount since inflation doesn't affect me
4. If I reject, we move to round 3, where I can make another offer
5. However, further rounds might lead to more inflation affecting Bob, which could make negotiations harder

Given that the offer isn't terrible ($450,000 is still a significant amount), and considering that prolonging the negotiation might make it harder to reach an agreement due to increasing inflation effects on Bob's side, I'll accept this offer.
