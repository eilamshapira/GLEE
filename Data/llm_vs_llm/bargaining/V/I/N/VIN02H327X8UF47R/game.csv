600000.0,400000.0,Let's split it fairly! I'll take 60% and you get 40%. This is a great starting point!,Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe a more equitable split would be 55% for me and 45% for you. This accounts for the 10% inflation that affects me each round. We both benefit from reaching an agreement sooner rather than later.",Bob,2,

360000.0,640000.0,"Alright Bob, given the situation with the decreasing value, how about this: I'll take 360000 and you get 640000. It's the best we can do with each round. Let's try to make a deal!",Alice,3,
