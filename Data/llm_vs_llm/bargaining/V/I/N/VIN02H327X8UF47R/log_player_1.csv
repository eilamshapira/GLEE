"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe a more equitable split would be 55% for me and 45% for you. This accounts for the 10% inflation that affects me each round. We both benefit from reaching an agreement sooner rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer for round 3, taking into account the inflation that affects me (20% less value compared to round 1) and Bob's potential inflation considerations:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000,
  ""message"": ""Alright Bob, given the situation with the decreasing value, how about this: I'll take 360,000 and you get 640,000. It's the best we can do with each round. Let's try to make a deal!""
