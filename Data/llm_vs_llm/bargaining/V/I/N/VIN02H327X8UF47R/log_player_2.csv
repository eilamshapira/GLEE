"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly! I'll take 60% and you get 40%. This is a great starting point! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get 40% ($400,000) while she gets 60% ($600,000). This isn't an even split, and with inflation reducing the value by 10% each round, I need to weigh whether making a counter-offer would be beneficial.

If I reject, I can make my own proposal next round, but the total will be worth 10% less to me. The $400,000 now would be equivalent to $444,444 in the next round (since $400,000 รท 0.9 = $444,444).

I believe I can propose a more favorable split in the next round, so I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that acknowledges we both deserve a fair share while considering the inflation factor affecting me.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe a more equitable split would be 55% for me and 45% for you. This accounts for the 10% inflation that affects me each round. We both benefit from reaching an agreement sooner rather than later.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, given the situation with the decreasing value, how about this: I'll take 360000 and you get 640000. It's the best we can do with each round. Let's try to make a deal! 
# Bob gain: 640000 
# Alice gain: 360000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is now proposing I get $640,000 (64%) while she gets $360,000 (36%). This is a significant improvement from her initial offer where I would have received only 40%.

Given that:
1. The money is worth 19% less to me in this round than in the first round
2. If I reject, the next round would make it worth even less (29% less than the first round)
3. Alice has moved considerably from her initial position
4. We're already in round 3 of a maximum of 12 rounds

This is a favorable offer that gives me the majority of the money. If I reject, there's no guarantee Alice would accept an even better deal for me in the next round, and the value would continue to decrease.
