60.0,40.0,I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation reducing the total value.,Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, I suggest a 55-45 split in my favor. This is actually better for you than waiting for another round since you'd face 10% inflation (your $45 now is worth more than a potential $50 or less after inflation). Let's avoid further devaluation of our money and come to an agreement now.",Bob,2,
