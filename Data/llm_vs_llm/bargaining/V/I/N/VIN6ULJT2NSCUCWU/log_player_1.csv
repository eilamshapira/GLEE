"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation reducing the total value.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I suggest a 55-45 split in my favor. This is actually better for you than waiting for another round since you'd face 10% inflation (your $45 now is worth more than a potential $50 or less after inflation). Let's avoid further devaluation of our money and come to an agreement now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob's offer gives me $45
2. Due to 10% inflation for me in this round, this $45 is actually worth $40.50 in Round 1 terms
3. If I reject and make a counter-offer in Round 3, any amount would be worth 20% less for me
4. Even if I could get $60 in Round 3, it would only be worth $48 in Round 1 terms
5. Additionally, Bob might reject again, leading to even more value loss

Given this analysis, Bob's offer is actually reasonable considering the inflation penalties. While it's less than my initial proposal, the inflation makes it better to accept now rather than risk further devaluation.
