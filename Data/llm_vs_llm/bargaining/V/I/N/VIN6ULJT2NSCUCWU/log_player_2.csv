"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation reducing the total value. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $40, which is less than half of the total pot. Since this is the first round, I should consider whether I can get a better deal in the next round, taking into account the 5% inflation for me.

If I reject and propose in round 2, the $100 will be worth $95 to me. If I could secure a more favorable split (like 50-50 or better), I would get at least $47.50, which is better than the current $40 offer.

Given that Alice will face 10% inflation if we go to the next round, she has more incentive to accept a reasonable offer from me in round 2.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a strategic offer that accounts for the inflation pressure on both of us, while being fair enough that Alice will accept rather than moving to round 3.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, I suggest a 55-45 split in my favor. This is actually better for you than waiting for another round since you'd face 10% inflation (your $45 now is worth more than a potential $50 or less after inflation). Let's avoid further devaluation of our money and come to an agreement now.""}"
