"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the inflation penalty that both of us face, while trying to be fair.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering you $450,000 and I'll take $550,000. This is a reasonable split considering that if we delay, both of us lose value - I lose 5% per round while you lose 10% per round. I'm proposing a split that gives both of us substantial value right now rather than risking further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
