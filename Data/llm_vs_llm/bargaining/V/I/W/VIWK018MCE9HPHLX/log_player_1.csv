"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair since you face higher inflation than me - if you reject, your share will be worth much less next round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm making a more generous offer, considering the inflation. Accept this, or the value will decrease further. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob is offering me $45
2. Due to 5% inflation, $45 now is worth $42.75 to me
3. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   - The money will be worth another 5% less for me
   - And 20% less for Bob
   - This will significantly weaken my negotiating position

While I got a lower amount than my initial proposal, the inflation impact makes this a reasonable offer. If I reject, both of us will lose more value, and Bob might be even less willing to accept a good offer due to the steep inflation he faces.
