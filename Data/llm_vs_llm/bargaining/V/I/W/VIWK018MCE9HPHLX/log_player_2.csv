"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair since you face higher inflation than me - if you reject, your share will be worth much less next round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the value of the money has decreased. For me, it's worth 20% less, so the total value is now $100 * 0.8 = $80. For Alice, it's worth 5% less, so the total value is now $100 * 0.95 = $95.

However, the actual amount to be divided is still $100. I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreased value.
