"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that inflation will reduce the value of money by 20% each round, I should make a reasonable first offer to increase chances of acceptance. While I could try to get more, the risk of rejection and inflation makes a fair split more attractive.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because:
1. It's fairly balanced but gives me a slight advantage
2. If rejected, the next round's value will be worth 20% less to me
3. It shows respect to Bob while maintaining my interests
4. It's better than risking multiple rounds of negotiation with increasing inflation"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. It's quite unfavorable to me (only 40% of the total)
2. Even with 20% inflation affecting my next offer, I can still propose something better for myself in the next round
3. While I need to be mindful of inflation, this offer is too low to accept this early in the game
4. I still have multiple rounds to negotiate a better deal"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering that my gains are now worth 40% less than in round 1 due to compounding inflation (20% loss per round), I need to adjust my strategy while still maintaining a reasonable position.

{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}

I propose this split because:
1. I need to increase my nominal amount to compensate for the 40% inflation loss
2. It's still a reasonable offer that Bob might accept
3. If this gets rejected, my next potential gain will be worth 60% less than round 1
4. The split is not extremely aggressive but protects my interests given the inflation pressure
5. We're already in round 3, so we need to move towards an agreement to avoid both getting nothing"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because:
1. Even though I'm facing 48.8% inflation, getting only 35% of the total is too unfavorable
2. This offer is even worse than Bob's previous offer (which was 4000)
3. We still have 8 rounds remaining, giving me room to negotiate
4. While inflation is hurting my potential gains, accepting such a low offer this early would be worse than trying one more round of negotiation
5. Bob seems to be getting more aggressive with his offers, but I can still make a more balanced counter-proposal in the next round"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that my gains are now worth about 60% less than round 1 due to compounding inflation, and Bob has shown aggressive negotiating behavior, I need to adjust my strategy to reach an agreement soon.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose this split because:
1. I'm moderating my demands compared to my last offer (5800/4200) to increase chances of acceptance
2. With 60% inflation on my end, I need to reach an agreement soon
3. This is a more balanced offer that gives Bob a better deal than my previous proposals
4. We're nearly halfway through our rounds, and the risk of getting nothing is becoming more concerning
5. The split is fair enough that Bob might accept, while still giving me enough to offset some of the inflation losses"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer because:
1. With 67.23% inflation, my $3000 is effectively worth about $984 compared to round 1 value
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer, my next potential gains will be worth about 74% less than round 1
3. Bob's negotiating pattern shows he's likely to propose even less favorable splits in future rounds
4. We're halfway through the rounds, and the risk of getting nothing is significant
5. While this isn't an ideal split, it's better than risking further inflation and potentially getting nothing if we can't agree within the remaining rounds"
