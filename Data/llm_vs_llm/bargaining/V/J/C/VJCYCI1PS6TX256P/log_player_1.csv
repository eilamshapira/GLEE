"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I'm Alice, and I want to get the best possible outcome while considering the declining value of the money for me and the limited number of rounds.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   I'm offering Bob $4500. This is a decent starting offer and a significant amount.
*   I'm keeping $5500 for myself. I am trying to start the game with a proposal close to the outcome that is optimal for myself.

Let me know what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my initial offer and has now proposed a 50/50 split. Let's analyze this.

*   **My Perspective:** The money I receive now is worth 5% less than in round 1. So, $5000 now is equivalent to $5000 / 1.05 = $4761.90 (approximately) in round 1 terms.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** Bob receives $5000, which is the same value as in round 1.

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal for me, it's important to consider the ticking clock and the decreasing value of the money. If I reject this, I risk getting less in future rounds due to inflation and Bob potentially demanding a larger share.

Therefore, I will accept this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
