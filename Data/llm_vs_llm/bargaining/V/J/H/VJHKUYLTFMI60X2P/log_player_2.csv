"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice offers me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, my next round's money will be worth less
4. $40 now is better than $44.44 in the next round (because $44.44 * 0.9 = $40)

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes immediate acceptance more attractive than a prolonged negotiation. $40 is a reasonable offer considering these constraints.
