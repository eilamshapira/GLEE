"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This ensures we both get a substantial amount, and we can avoid the loss from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice is proposing I get $400,000 (40%) while she gets $600,000 (60%).

If I reject, we move to Round 2, where I can make an offer. However, the total amount will decrease by 5% due to inflation, leaving $950,000 to divide.

Even if I propose a more favorable split in the next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation, potentially reducing our total gains.

While the split isn't entirely equal, $400,000 is still a substantial amount, and avoiding the inflation penalty seems prudent.
