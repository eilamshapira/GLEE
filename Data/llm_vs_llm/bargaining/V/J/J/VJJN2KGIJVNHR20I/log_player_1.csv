Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move, which I think is fair considering the time pressure of inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the 20% inflation after the first round, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable, as the money is now worth $80. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer because:
1. With 20% inflation, the total value is now only $80
2. Getting $45 now (worth $36 after inflation) is better than risking another round where everything would be worth even less
3. It's a reasonable split close to 50-50
4. Continuing to negotiate would mean losing more value to inflation"
