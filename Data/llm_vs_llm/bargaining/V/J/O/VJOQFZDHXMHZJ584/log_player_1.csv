"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me propose a split that accounts for the higher inflation penalty I face compared to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I suggest this 60-40 split because if Bob rejects, we'll both lose value due to inflation - I'll lose 10% and he'll lose 5%. This offers him a substantial portion while protecting me from the higher inflation risk I face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

If I accept Bob's offer now:
- I get $400,000 at 90% value = $360,000 effective value
- Bob gets $600,000 at 95% value = $570,000 effective value

If I reject and propose in next round:
- Values will decrease further (to 80% for me, 90% for Bob)
- Even if I propose a better split, Bob might reject again

Since the inflation penalty hits me harder than Bob, and there's risk of further value loss in future rounds, I should probably accept this offer despite it not being ideal.
