600000.0,400000.0,"I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that money devalues more quickly for you (20%) than for me (10%) in each round. This is a fair first offer that accounts for the time pressure we both face.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"I propose a 55-45 split in my favor.  While I acknowledge the difference in devaluation, we're both losing money each round. This offer allows for a more equitable division, and gives us both a substantial share.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. With your 20% devaluation rate versus my 10%, this split actually helps preserve more total value. If we keep negotiating, we both lose significant value - you're losing twice as fast as I am. This is a balanced offer that benefits us both.",Alice,3,
