"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor.  While I acknowledge the difference in devaluation, we're both losing money each round. This offer allows for a more equitable division, and gives us both a substantial share. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 55-45 split in Bob's favor is not optimal given our different inflation rates. Since my money devalues slower (10% vs 20%), I should receive a larger share to maximize overall value. I'll make a more compelling offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. With your 20% devaluation rate versus my 10%, this split actually helps preserve more total value. If we keep negotiating, we both lose significant value - you're losing twice as fast as I am. This is a balanced offer that benefits us both.""}"
