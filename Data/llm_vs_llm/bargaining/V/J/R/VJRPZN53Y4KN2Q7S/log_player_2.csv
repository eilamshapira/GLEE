"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that money devalues more quickly for you (20%) than for me (10%) in each round. This is a fair first offer that accounts for the time pressure we both face. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a 55-45 split in my favor.  While I acknowledge the difference in devaluation, we're both losing money each round. This offer allows for a more equitable division, and gives us both a substantial share.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split in my favor. With your 20% devaluation rate versus my 10%, this split actually helps preserve more total value. If we keep negotiating, we both lose significant value - you're losing twice as fast as I am. This is a balanced offer that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
