"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that you receive $40 and I keep $60. This split considers the inflation riskâ€”each round delays our gain. Let's settle now to avoid further loss in value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money more evenly. I propose 60 for me, 40 for you. This way we both get a decent share, and we can avoid further inflation risk. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
