"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

For me (Bob), the money is now worth 95% of its original value, so $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500.
For Alice, the money is now worth 90% of its original value, so $10,000 * 0.90 = $9,000.

Considering this, I'll make a fair offer.

{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer.

For me (Bob), the money is now worth 90.25% of its original value (100% - 9.75% = 90.25%), so the $4800 offered is equivalent to $4800 / 0.9025 ≈ $5316 in the original value.
For Alice, the money is now worth 81% of its original value (100% - 19% = 81%), so the $5200 offered is equivalent to $5200 / 0.81 ≈ $6419 in the original value.

Given this, Alice's offer seems somewhat reasonable, but I'll still consider rejecting it to try to get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer.

For me (Bob), the money is now worth 85.7375% of its original value (90.25% * 0.95 = 85.7375%), so I'll aim to get a bit more to compensate for the loss.
For Alice, the money is now worth 72.9% of its original value (81% * 0.9 = 72.9%), so I'll try to get a fair share.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer.

For me (Bob), the money is now worth 81.45% of its original value (100% - 18.55% = 81.45%), so the $5000 offered is equivalent to $5000 / 0.8145 ≈ $6139 in the original value.
For Alice, the money is now worth 65.61% of its original value (100% - 34.39% = 65.61%), so the $5000 offered is equivalent to $5000 / 0.6561 ≈ $7623 in the original value.

Given that the offer is an equal split, but considering the inflation, it seems like a relatively fair deal. I'll accept the offer to avoid further losses due to inflation.
