"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that both Bob and I face depreciation in future rounds, with his being more severe (20% vs my 5%).

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is still a substantial amount for Bob ($400,000), and considering the higher depreciation rate he faces (20% per round), it would be rational for him to accept this offer rather than move to the next round where his potential gains would be worth significantly less."
