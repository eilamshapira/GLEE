"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. If I reject, the total money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round, so the $1,000,000 will effectively be worth $800,000 from my perspective. For Alice, it will only be worth 5% less, or $950,000.

In the current offer, I would get $400,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer, I'll be dividing an effectively smaller pie (for me).

Let me analyze if rejecting makes sense. Even if I proposed a 50-50 split in the next round ($500,000 each), my share would only be worth $400,000 to me after the 20% inflation, which is the same as what I'm being offered now. And Alice might reject that anyway.
