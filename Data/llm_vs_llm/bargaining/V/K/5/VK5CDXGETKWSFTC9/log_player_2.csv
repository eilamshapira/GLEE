"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm evaluating Alice's offer where I (as Bob) would get $40 and Alice would get $60.

Let me consider this carefully. If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total value will decrease by 5% to $95. This means even if I proposed a more favorable split for myself, the total pie would be smaller.

While Alice's offer gives her a larger share, $40 is still a substantial amount. If I reject and the negotiation continues for multiple rounds, inflation could significantly reduce our total value.
