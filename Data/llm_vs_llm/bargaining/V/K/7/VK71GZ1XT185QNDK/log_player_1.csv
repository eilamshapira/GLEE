"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer for the division of $1,000,000.

Given that inflation affects me at 5% per round and Bob at 10% per round, I should consider that time pressure affects him more than me. However, a fair initial offer would be reasonable to start negotiations.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split of $500,000 each, which is fair and gives us both significant value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, considering the inflation rates and our negotiation so far.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""bob_gain"": 550000}

I'm offering a slight improvement for Bob compared to my initial offer, but more favorable to me than his counter-offer. Since inflation affects Bob more significantly (10% per round vs my 5%), this compromise should be attractive to him while still being reasonable for me."
