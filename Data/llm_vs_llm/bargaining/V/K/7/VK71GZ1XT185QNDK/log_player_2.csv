"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. It's a 50-50 split of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, in the next round:
   * The money will be worth 10% less to me
   * The money will be worth 5% less to Alice
   * I can make my own proposal
3. A 50-50 split is fair in many situations, but given the asymmetric inflation rates, I can probably do better

Since my inflation rate is higher than Alice's (10% vs 5%), time pressure affects me more. However, this is the first round, and I still have room to negotiate for a better deal given that I'm at a disadvantage due to higher inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected the 50-50 split, I should propose a division that accounts for my higher inflation rate while still being acceptable to Alice. Given that my money loses value faster (10% vs 5% per round), I should get a larger share to compensate for this disadvantage.

I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

This offer is justified because:
1. It compensates for my higher inflation rate
2. It's not so extreme that Alice would definitely reject it
3. If Alice rejects, we both face value loss, but I face more, so this gives her incentive to accept
4. It's still within a reasonable negotiation range"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice has increased her initial offer from 500,000 to 550,000 for me
2. Current value for me: 550,000 * 0.81 = 445,500 (after 19% inflation)
3. Current value for Alice: 450,000 * 0.9025 = 406,125 (after 9.75% inflation)
4. If I reject:
   * Next round my inflation will be even worse (29%)
   * Alice's inflation will be 14.75%
   * I can make another offer, but time is working against me more than against Alice

Given that:
- The offer is better than the initial 50-50 split
- Inflation is significantly eating into my potential gains
- The difference in our inflation rates means waiting is worse for me
- Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by improving her offer
