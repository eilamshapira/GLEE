"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer. Since I'm affected by inflation and Bob isn't, I should try to secure a good deal early.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering I'm under inflation pressure while Bob isn't. This gives Bob a substantial sum while protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is too low, especially considering the inflation pressure I'm under. I can still get a better deal in the next round, even with the 10% inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that we're now in round 3, and any money I receive is worth 20% less than in round 1, I need to adjust my strategy. I'll make a more moderate offer to increase chances of acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm reducing my demand from the initial offer to show flexibility, but still maintaining a favorable split given my inflation disadvantage. With 20% inflation, my $550,000 is effectively worth $440,000 to me now, so this is quite reasonable."
