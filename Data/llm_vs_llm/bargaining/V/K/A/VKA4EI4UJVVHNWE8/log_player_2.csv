"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my decision for Round 1:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 2:

```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000}
```

My reasoning is that I need to secure a larger share to account for Alice's diminishing returns in future rounds, and this is still a reasonable offer that leaves Alice with a significant amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the updated situation. Let's analyze:

*   **Alice's Offer:** $450,000 for me, $550,000 for her.
*   **Inflation:** Alice's money is worth 19% less than the initial value.

Let's consider the value of Alice's $550,000 to her: $550,000 * (1 - 0.19) = $445,500

Compared to the original $1,000,000, I'm being offered 45% of the original amount.

Given the time constraint and Alice's continued losses due to inflation, I will accept this offer.
