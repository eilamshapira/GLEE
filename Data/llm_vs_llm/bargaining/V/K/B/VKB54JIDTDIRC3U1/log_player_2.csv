"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $400,000 and she gets $600,000 of the $1,000,000. While this isn't an even split, I should consider the inflation factor.

With each round, my money loses 5% value while Alice's loses 20%. If I reject and the game continues to round 2, any amount I receive will be worth 5% less to me. Meanwhile, Alice has a stronger incentive to settle quickly since her inflation is much higher.

Given that this is just the first round and Alice is taking a significantly larger portion, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counteroffer that takes into account our different inflation rates. Since Alice faces much higher inflation (20% per round versus my 5%), she has a stronger incentive to reach an agreement sooner. I'll propose a more balanced split while still acknowledging this asymmetry.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the money evenly, with each of us receiving $500,000. This is a fair division that gives us both a substantial amount, and avoids further rounds where your money would lose 20% of its value per round compared to my 5%."
