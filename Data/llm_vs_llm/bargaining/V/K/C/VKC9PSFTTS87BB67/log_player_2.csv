"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000 of the $10,000 total.

If I reject this offer, I can make my own proposal in the next round. However, I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty that affects only me. If I reject, the $10,000 will be worth only $9,500 to me in the next round, while it remains $10,000 for Alice.

Given this asymmetric inflation that only affects me, I should be somewhat more inclined to accept reasonable offers. However, this first offer gives Alice 60% and me only 40%, which seems somewhat unfair given we're just starting.

I believe I can propose a more equitable split in the next round, even accounting for the 5% inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer that accounts for the inflation penalty I face.

{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750}

I'm proposing a split where I receive $5,250 and Alice receives $4,750. This is a reasonable offer that gives me slightly more than half, accounting for the fact that I face a 5% inflation penalty if we continue to another round. This division is fair and should be acceptable to Alice, as she still receives a substantial portion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4250 
# Alice gain: 5750 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer considering the inflation penalties.

Alice is now offering me $4,250 while she takes $5,750. This is a slight improvement from her first offer where she proposed $4,000 for me.

The money is now worth 9.75% less to me due to inflation (5% compounded over two rounds). If I reject and move to round 4, the money will be worth about 14.26% less to me (another 5% decrease), while Alice faces no inflation penalty.

If I reject this offer, the $10,000 pot will effectively be worth only about $8,574 to me in the next round due to inflation. This significantly reduces my negotiating leverage.

While Alice's offer isn't perfectly equal, given the asymmetric inflation penalty I face, getting $4,250 now is likely better than risking further inflation for a potentially marginal improvement.
