"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

The offer is slightly in Alice's favor (55% vs 45%), but it's not terribly unfair. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less next round (9,500$ total), and while I could propose a split more in my favor, Alice could then reject and we'd lose another 5%.

A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, and $4,500 is still a substantial amount. Making a strategic decision to accept now rather than risk further devaluation seems wise.
