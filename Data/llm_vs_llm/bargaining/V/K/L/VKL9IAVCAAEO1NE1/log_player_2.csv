"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's proposing a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
- This is a completely fair division
- There's no inflation effect for me, but I don't know about Alice
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it
- There's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
- This is a reasonable first offer that ensures both parties get a good amount

Given these considerations, I'll accept this fair offer.
