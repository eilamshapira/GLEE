60.0,40.0,I suggest a fair split considering the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. Let's resolve this quickly and both benefit.,Alice,1,

1.0,99.0,"Alice, if we continue to later rounds the inflation will erode your share even further. Accepting $1 now (which is still more than what you'd effectively secure if you delay) is better than the risk of ending up with nothing. Let's conclude this quickly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, your last offer was extremely unfair. I propose this split which accounts for inflation risk. If we keep going, we both risk getting nothing. This is a reasonable offer - let's conclude this now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, every additional round further erodes the value of your shareâ€”by round 4 your money is already worth about 85.7% of its original value, and waiting only makes it worse. Accepting 45 now secures you more than a prolonged negotiation would. Let's conclude this fairly and efficiently.",Bob,4,
