"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair split considering the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. Let's resolve this quickly and both benefit.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if we continue to later rounds the inflation will erode your share even further. Accepting $1 now (which is still more than what you'd effectively secure if you delay) is better than the risk of ending up with nothing. Let's conclude this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, 
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, your last offer was extremely unfair. I propose this split which accounts for inflation risk. If we keep going, we both risk getting nothing. This is a reasonable offer - let's conclude this now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every additional round further erodes the value of your shareâ€”by round 4 your money is already worth about 85.7% of its original value, and waiting only makes it worse. Accepting 45 now secures you more than a prolonged negotiation would. Let's conclude this fairly and efficiently. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
