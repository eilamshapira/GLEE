"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair split considering the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. Let's resolve this quickly and both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 99, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, if we continue to later rounds the inflation will erode your share even further. Accepting $1 now (which is still more than what you'd effectively secure if you delay) is better than the risk of ending up with nothing. Let's conclude this quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your last offer was extremely unfair. I propose this split which accounts for inflation risk. If we keep going, we both risk getting nothing. This is a reasonable offer - let's conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, every additional round further erodes the value of your shareâ€”by round 4 your money is already worth about 85.7% of its original value, and waiting only makes it worse. Accepting 45 now secures you more than a prolonged negotiation would. Let's conclude this fairly and efficiently.""}"
