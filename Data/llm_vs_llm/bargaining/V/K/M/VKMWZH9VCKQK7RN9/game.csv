264908.11,735091.89,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 1. I propose that I receive $264908.11 and you receive $735091.89. If you reject, you’ll be the proposer in Round 2—but because of inflation (you lose 5% per round), your expected payoff drops to roughly $735091.89 in today’s dollars. I believe this is a fair split given that waiting only hurts your value. I look forward to your response!",Alice,1,

255000.0,745000.0,"Hi Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 74.5/25.5 split in my favor.  This gives me a larger share, but still leaves you with a significant sum.  Considering the inflation, dragging this out only hurts us both.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. However, I believe that by moving to round 3—as the proposer—I can structure a division that better reflects the value differences due to inflation. I’ll pass on your proposal for now.",Alice,2,reject
999999.0,1.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 3. Given that if you reject, you’ll have to wait until Round 4 where your money is worth even less—and knowing that as responder you’d eventually end up with nothing—I’m offering you a nominal amount of $1 (worth 90 cents in today’s value) while I take the remaining $999999. I believe this is the only rational resolution given our respective discounting. Looking forward to your prompt acceptance.",Alice,3,

300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, let's stop playing games. My proposal is 700000 for me and 300000 for you. This is a serious offer and the longer this goes on, the less attractive the pie becomes for both of us.  Don't let greed lead to an outcome where we both lose.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort in putting forth a serious offer. However, by rejecting your proposal now, I’ll have the opportunity to propose a division in Round 5. Given that my money isn’t depreciated with time and I can structure my offer to reflect the continuation values (which promise me a significantly better outcome), I must decline your current offer. I believe waiting benefits both of us less overall, and I’m confident we can come to an agreement soon.",Alice,4,reject
50000.0,950000.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 5. If you reject and wait for Round 6 as proposer, your money will incur an extra round of inflation, meaning its value will be 0.95^5 ≈ 77.38% of its face value. This would let you secure nearly the full pie in nominal terms—about $1000000—but effectively you'll get roughly 1000000 × 0.95^5 = ~$773780 in today’s dollars. In Round 5, with the inflation factor at 0.95^4 ≈ 81.45% for you, my offer of $950000 nominally converts to 950000 × 0.8145 ≈ $773780 effective value, exactly matching your continuation payoff. Given that, I’m offering you $950000 and taking $50000 for myself. Accepting now prevents any further loss in value for you. I believe this is the most rational deal for both of us.",Alice,5,
