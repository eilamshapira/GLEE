Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 1. I propose that I receive $264908.11 and you receive $735091.89. If you reject, you’ll be the proposer in Round 2—but because of inflation (you lose 5% per round), your expected payoff drops to roughly $735091.89 in today’s dollars. I believe this is a fair split given that waiting only hurts your value. I look forward to your response!

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 745000, ""alice_gain"": 255000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 74.5/25.5 split in my favor.  This gives me a larger share, but still leaves you with a significant sum.  Considering the inflation, dragging this out only hurts us both.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 3. Given that if you reject, you’ll have to wait until Round 4 where your money is worth even less—and knowing that as responder you’d eventually end up with nothing—I’m offering you a nominal amount of $1 (worth 90 cents in today’s value) while I take the remaining $999999. I believe this is the only rational resolution given our respective discounting. Looking forward to your prompt acceptance. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a tough situation, and Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation mechanic to pressure me. However, accepting $1 is essentially giving up on almost the entire amount.  I believe there's still room to negotiate a better deal, even with the time pressure."

Don't let greed lead to an outcome where we both lose.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 5. If you reject and wait for Round 6 as proposer, your money will incur an extra round of inflation, meaning its value will be 0.95^5 ≈ 77.38% of its face value. This would let you secure nearly the full pie in nominal terms—about $1000000—but effectively you'll get roughly 1000000 × 0.95^5 = ~$773780 in today’s dollars. In Round 5, with the inflation factor at 0.95^4 ≈ 81.45% for you, my offer of $950000 nominally converts to 950000 × 0.8145 ≈ $773780 effective value, exactly matching your continuation payoff. Given that, I’m offering you $950000 and taking $50000 for myself. Accepting now prevents any further loss in value for you. I believe this is the most rational deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 950000 
# Alice gain: 50000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice has made a clever offer that I should accept. While it might seem tempting to hold out for a larger share in the next round, her analysis is correct. The impact of inflation means that my potential gain from waiting is completely offset by the devaluation of the money. Accepting this offer guarantees me the best possible outcome considering the current circumstances."
