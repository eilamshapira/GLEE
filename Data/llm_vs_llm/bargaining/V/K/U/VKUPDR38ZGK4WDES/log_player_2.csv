Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me after the first round, the actual amount I'm dividing is $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000. For Alice, it's $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000. However, the original amount is still the basis for our division, so I'll make my offer based on $1,000,000.

To make a fair offer, I'll propose a 50-50 split of the original $1,000,000, considering the value reduction.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another round, another devaluation!

Considering the devaluation, if I accept Alice's offer, the $50,000 I gain is actually worth $50,000 * 0.81 (since it's 19% less than the original value) = $40,500 to me.

I think I can do better than that.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth even less now. For me, it's 10% less each round, so after 3 rounds, it's $1,000,000 * (0.9)^3 = $729,000. For Alice, it's 5% less each round, so after 3 rounds, it's $1,000,000 * (0.95)^3 = $857,375.

I'll make a more generous offer to Alice this time, hoping she'll accept.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 80000 
# Alice gain: 920000 
Do you accept this offer?","The devaluation is really starting to hurt now. If I accept Alice's offer, the $80,000 I gain is actually worth $80,000 * 0.6561 (since it's 34.39% less than the original value) = $52,488 to me.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I need to consider the alternative: making another offer and risking further devaluation.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The devaluation continues. For me, it's $1,000,000 * (0.9)^5 = $590,490. For Alice, it's $1,000,000 * (0.95)^5 = $774,048.

I'll try to make a more appealing offer to Alice this time, while still being mindful of my own dwindling value.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 120000 
# Alice gain: 880000 
Do you accept this offer?","The devaluation is getting worse. If I accept Alice's offer, the $120,000 I gain is actually worth $120,000 * 0.5314 (since it's 46.86% less than the original value) = $63,768 to me.

At this point, I'm starting to think that any offer that gives me a significant amount of money is better than risking further devaluation. However, I still don't like the idea of giving Alice such a large share.

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The devaluation continues to erode the value of the money. For me, it's $1,000,000 * (0.9)^7 = $478,296. For Alice, it's $1,000,000 * (0.95)^7 = $697,676.

I'll try to make a more reasonable offer, considering the devaluation. I'll give Alice a bit more, hoping she'll accept.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","The devaluation is really taking its toll. If I accept Alice's offer, the $150,000 I gain is actually worth $150,000 * 0.4305 (since it's 56.95% less than the original value) = $64,575 to me.

At this point, I'm starting to think that I should take what I can get. The devaluation is only going to get worse, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing.
