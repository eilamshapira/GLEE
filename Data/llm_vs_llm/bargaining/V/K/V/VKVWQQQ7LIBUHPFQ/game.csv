600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I face 10% inflation each round while you don't, this is a fair offer that gives us both substantial value without needing to drag this out.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but let's consider the inflation dynamics. If we continue to the next round, your money will be worth 10% less, while mine maintains its value. Since you face this disadvantage, I'm offering you $400000 now, which is actually more valuable than getting $440000 in the next round (which would be worth only $396000 to you after 10% inflation). This split is fair given our different inflation rates.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I've considered your point about inflation, but your counter was too aggressive. Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split. Remember, even though I face inflation, we both benefit from concluding this quickly rather than letting the value erode through multiple rounds of negotiation.",Alice,3,
