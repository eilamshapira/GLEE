"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I face 10% inflation each round while you don't, this is a fair offer that gives us both substantial value without needing to drag this out.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but let's consider the inflation dynamics. If we continue to the next round, your money will be worth 10% less, while mine maintains its value. Since you face this disadvantage, I'm offering you $400000 now, which is actually more valuable than getting $440000 in the next round (which would be worth only $396000 to you after 10% inflation). This split is fair given our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation mechanic means each round reduces my purchasing power, but Bob's offer of $400,000 is too low given I'm still early in the negotiation. Even with 10% inflation, I can still make or receive better offers in the next round. While Bob's logic about inflation is correct, starting from my initial $600,000 offer, his counter of $400,000 is too aggressive a reduction."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Bob, I've considered your point about inflation, but your counter was too aggressive. Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split. Remember, even though I face inflation, we both benefit from concluding this quickly rather than letting the value erode through multiple rounds of negotiation.""}"
