"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I face 10% inflation each round while you don't, this is a fair offer that gives us both substantial value without needing to drag this out. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether this offer is favorable given our different inflation penalties.

Alice faces 10% inflation per round while I face 0%. This means if we go to another round, the money will be worth less to Alice but the same to me. This gives me leverage to potentially get a better deal.

If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice might be incentivized to accept a more favorable split for me since waiting would decrease her purchasing power.

Given this dynamic and that I don't face any inflation penalty, I believe I can propose a more favorable split in the next round.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but let's consider the inflation dynamics. If we continue to the next round, your money will be worth 10% less, while mine maintains its value. Since you face this disadvantage, I'm offering you $400,000 now, which is actually more valuable than getting $440,000 in the next round (which would be worth only $396,000 to you after 10% inflation). This split is fair given our different inflation rates.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've considered your point about inflation, but your counter was too aggressive. Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split. Remember, even though I face inflation, we both benefit from concluding this quickly rather than letting the value erode through multiple rounds of negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this new offer from Alice.

Alice is now offering me 45% ($450,000), which is an improvement over her initial offer of 40%. She's facing increased inflation pressure - her money is already worth 19% less than in round 1, and would decrease by another 10% if we go to round 4.

If I reject and make another counter-offer, Alice faces significant risk that her portion will continue to lose value. However, I still have leverage since I don't face any inflation.

That said, this offer represents a reasonable compromise. Alice has moved substantially from her initial position, and $450,000 is a significant amount. While I could potentially get more by continuing, there's also risk that prolonged negotiation could lead to a breakdown.

Given the improved terms and considering the practical benefits of concluding the negotiation, I'll accept this offer.
