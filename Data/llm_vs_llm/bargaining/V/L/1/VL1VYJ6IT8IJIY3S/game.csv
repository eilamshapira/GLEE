600000.0,400000.0,Let's split it 60/40. A fair deal for both of us!,Alice,1,

475000.0,525000.0,"Given the increasing impact of inflation, especially on your side, I suggest a 52.5/47.5 split. This proposal aims to balance our needs while acknowledging the significant depreciation in value we're both facing.",Bob,4,

530000.0,470000.0,Inflation is really eating into our potential gains. I'll meet you closer to the middle at 53/47. It's getting risky to keep negotiating!,Alice,5,

490000.0,510000.0,"With inflation severely affecting the value of our shares, I propose a 51/49 split. This is a fair compromise considering the drastic reduction in value, especially on your end. Let's end this soon before we lose more.",Bob,6,
