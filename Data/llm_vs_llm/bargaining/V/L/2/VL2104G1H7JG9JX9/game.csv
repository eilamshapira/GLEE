600000.0,400000.0,Let's start with a fair split. I'm offering you $400000. Accept and we both win!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,Let's go for a fair 50/50 split. It's the most equitable way to ensure we both benefit equally from this deal!,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I'm accounting for the inflation that's affecting me. I need a bit more to make this worthwhile. I'm offering you $450000. Take it before inflation makes it even harder!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Alice, let's try $480k for me and $520k for you. I hope this addresses the inflation impact on you while being fair.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, the inflation is really hitting me hard. I need $650000 to make this viable. It's still a good chunk of change for you, and time is running out!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
540000.0,460000.0,"Alice, considering the inflation impact on you, let's try $460k for me and $540k for you. This seems fairer given the circumstances.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, this is getting desperate. Inflation is killing me. I need $700000, or it's really not worth my time. Consider this a last call for a deal!",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
560000.0,440000.0,"Alice, let's aim for $440k for me and $560k for you. This acknowledges the inflation impact you've experienced while still being a good deal for both of us.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, I'm really losing value fast. I absolutely need $750000 at this point. This is my final serious offer. Otherwise, we both walk away with nothing.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
580000.0,420000.0,"Alice, I understand your situation with inflation. How about $420k for me and $580k for you? This gets you more to account for the loss in value.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Bob, this is it. I need $800000 to even consider this. It's almost worthless to me otherwise. $200000 is better than nothing for you. Final offer!",Alice,11,
