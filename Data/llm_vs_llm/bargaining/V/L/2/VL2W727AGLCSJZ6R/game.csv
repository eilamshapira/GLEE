50.0,50.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a straightforward 50/50 split of the $100. By settling now we both avoid any delays—especially since my share loses value over time—so let's secure the full value for both of us immediately. What do you think?",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. I believe this is fair considering the risk of inflation diminishing our potential returns with each round. Let's wrap this up now and secure a good deal for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, thanks for your proposal. However, given the depreciation I face as rounds progress, I still expect to do better on my own next round. I appreciate your effort, but I’ll pass on this offer.",Alice,2,reject
14.0,86.0,"Hi Bob, I know that further delay will hit both of us hard—my value is dropping by 20% in this round and yours even more if we wait. To avoid the harsher discount of the future, I'm offering you 86 and taking 14. This split gives you almost what you could secure by waiting while letting us close the deal now. Let’s settle and save ourselves further losses!",Alice,3,
