"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a straightforward 50/50 split of the $100. By settling now we both avoid any delays—especially since my share loses value over time—so let's secure the full value for both of us immediately. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. I believe this is fair considering the risk of inflation diminishing our potential returns with each round. Let's wrap this up now and secure a good deal for both of us."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I know that further delay will hit both of us hard—my value is dropping by 20% in this round and yours even more if we wait. To avoid the harsher discount of the future, I'm offering you 86 and taking 14. This split gives you almost what you could secure by waiting while letting us close the deal now. Let’s settle and save ourselves further losses! 
# Bob gain: 86 
# Alice gain: 14 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice's offer is now very good for me. Even though the total value has decreased, getting $86 is significantly better than risking another round where I'd have even less bargaining power."
