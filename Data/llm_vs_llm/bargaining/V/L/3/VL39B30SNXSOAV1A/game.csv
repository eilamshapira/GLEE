60.0,40.0,I propose we split the money with me getting $60 and you getting $40. This seems fair considering the impact of inflation on me.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
2.0,98.0,"Alice, please consider that if you reject this offer, the inflation will worsen your outcome in the next roundâ€”your dollars will lose even more value. Accepting now guarantees you an effective $1.80 (2 nominal dollars at a 10% discount) rather than risking nearly nothing later. Please accept this rational and final offer.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's split the money equally. This way, we both get a fair share, and I can still get a reasonable amount even with the inflation affecting my gains.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
1.0,99.0,"Alice, every additional round diminishes the real value of your money even further. Accepting this offer secures you a guaranteed effective value (about $0.73), whereas rejecting will only leave you with nothing in the long run. Let's conclude this now rather than letting inflation erode your share completely.",Bob,4,
