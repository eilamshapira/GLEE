"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, please consider that if you reject this offer, the inflation will worsen your outcome in the next roundâ€”your dollars will lose even more value. Accepting now guarantees you an effective $1.80 (2 nominal dollars at a 10% discount) rather than risking nearly nothing later. Please accept this rational and final offer. 
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every additional round diminishes the real value of your money even further. Accepting this offer secures you a guaranteed effective value (about $0.73), whereas rejecting will only leave you with nothing in the long run. Let's conclude this now rather than letting inflation erode your share completely. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99
