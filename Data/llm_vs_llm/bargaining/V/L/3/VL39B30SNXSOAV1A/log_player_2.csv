"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with me getting $60 and you getting $40. This seems fair considering the impact of inflation on me. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 98, ""alice_gain"": 2, ""message"": ""Alice, please consider that if you reject this offer, the inflation will worsen your outcome in the next roundâ€”your dollars will lose even more value. Accepting now guarantees you an effective $1.80 (2 nominal dollars at a 10% discount) rather than risking nearly nothing later. Please accept this rational and final offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money equally. This way, we both get a fair share, and I can still get a reasonable amount even with the inflation affecting my gains. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 99, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, every additional round diminishes the real value of your money even further. Accepting this offer secures you a guaranteed effective value (about $0.73), whereas rejecting will only leave you with nothing in the long run. Let's conclude this now rather than letting inflation erode your share completely.""}"
