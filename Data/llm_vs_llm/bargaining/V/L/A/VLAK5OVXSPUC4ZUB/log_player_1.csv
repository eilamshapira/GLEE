"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. Let's be reasonable. We both need to get something out of this, and this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation impact means my $4500 would only be worth $4050 now. I can make a better counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for further inflation. Also, Bob's insistence on taking the majority share doesn't seem fair given I made the first reasonable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. Due to inflation, my purchasing power is declining faster than yours (10% vs 5% per round). This 55-45 split in my favor is fair considering this difference. If we continue negotiating, we both lose value. Let's conclude this now.""}"
