Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. Due to inflation, my purchasing power is declining faster than yours (10% vs 5% per round). This 55-45 split in my favor is fair considering this difference. If we continue negotiating, we both lose value. Let's conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
