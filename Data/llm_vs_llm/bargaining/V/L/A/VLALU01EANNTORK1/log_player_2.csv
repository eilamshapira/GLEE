"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is fair and if I can get a better deal in the next round, taking into account the 5% inflation for me and 10% inflation for Alice.

If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-offer in round 2, but the total value will be worth 5% less to me (950,000 effective value) and 10% less to Alice (900,000 effective value).

The current offer gives me $400,000, which is less than half. If I reject and make a counter-offer, I could potentially get more. However, I need to consider that Alice might reject my counter-offer as well, leading to further depreciation.

Given the inflation rates, it might be strategic to negotiate for a better deal since Alice faces a higher inflation rate and thus has more incentive to reach an agreement soon.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice faces a higher inflation rate (10% vs my 5%), she has more incentive to reach an agreement quickly. I'll propose a more balanced split that's still favorable to me, while being reasonable enough that she'll likely accept rather than face another round of significant depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

The 1,000,000 dollars is now worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice compared to the first round. My proposal gives me a majority share while still giving Alice a substantial portion. This is more balanced than her initial offer, and considering the inflation factors, it should be appealing enough for her to accept rather than continuing to the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer, taking into account the increasing inflation.

If I reject this offer:
- In the next round, the money will be worth 14.75% less to me than in round 1 (another 5% decrease)
- For Alice, it would be worth 29% less than in round 1 (another 10% decrease)
- Alice has offered me less than her first offer ($350K vs $400K), which seems like a step backward

This offer gives me even less than the first round, which doesn't seem reasonable since we've both lost value due to inflation. Alice is actually asking for more now ($650K vs $600K initially) despite the money being worth less to her.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates, Alice has more to lose by continuing. My rejection would signal that I won't accept diminishing offers.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alice's last offer was actually worse for me than her initial offer, despite the ongoing inflation. This suggests she's taking a hard negotiating stance. However, the asymmetric inflation rates (10% for her vs 5% for me per round) mean she has more incentive to reach an agreement soon.

For this round, I'll propose a balanced offer that accounts for the current inflation rates and gives us both a fair share. I'll reduce my previous demand slightly to show flexibility while still maintaining a position of strength.

{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000}

This offer is more balanced than my previous one and gives Alice a substantial portion. At this point, the money is worth 14.75% less to me and 29% less to Alice compared to round 1. If Alice rejects this offer, she'll face another 10% depreciation in the next round, which should make this offer more appealing than continuing the negotiation."
