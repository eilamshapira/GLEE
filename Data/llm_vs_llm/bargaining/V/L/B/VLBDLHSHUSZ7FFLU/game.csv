377669.0,622331.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid the inflation bite we both face (albeit possibly differently), I propose a division that reflects timely agreement. Based on a simple backward‐induction logic assuming similar time discounting (about 10% per round), I suggest that I receive $377669 and you receive $622331. Let’s wrap this up in round 1 so we both secure as much value as possible!",Alice,1,

350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I believe a more balanced division is in order. I propose I receive $650000 and you receive $350000. This way, we both get a fair share and can avoid further rounds where inflation might affect us more.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, while I would like a more favorable split, waiting further would only cost me additional value due to my inflation penalty. Your offer gives me $350000, which even discounted by 10% in round 2 is better than the anticipated worse deal I might secure if I wait. So I'll accept your proposal.",Alice,2,accept
