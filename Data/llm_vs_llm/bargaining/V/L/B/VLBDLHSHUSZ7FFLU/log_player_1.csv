"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 377669, ""bob_gain"": 622331, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid the inflation bite we both face (albeit possibly differently), I propose a division that reflects timely agreement. Based on a simple backward‐induction logic assuming similar time discounting (about 10% per round), I suggest that I receive $377,669 and you receive $622,331. Let’s wrap this up in round 1 so we both secure as much value as possible!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I believe a more balanced division is in order. I propose I receive $650000 and you receive $350000. This way, we both get a fair share and can avoid further rounds where inflation might affect us more. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, while I would like a more favorable split, waiting further would only cost me additional value due to my inflation penalty. Your offer gives me $350,000, which even discounted by 10% in round 2 is better than the anticipated worse deal I might secure if I wait. So I'll accept your proposal.""}"
