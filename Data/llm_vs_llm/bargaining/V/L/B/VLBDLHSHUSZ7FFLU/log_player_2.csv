"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid the inflation bite we both face (albeit possibly differently), I propose a division that reflects timely agreement. Based on a simple backward‐induction logic assuming similar time discounting (about 10% per round), I suggest that I receive $377669 and you receive $622331. Let’s wrap this up in round 1 so we both secure as much value as possible! 
# Bob gain: 622331 
# Alice gain: 377669 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I believe a more balanced division is in order. I propose I receive $650,000 and you receive $350,000. This way, we both get a fair share and can avoid further rounds where inflation might affect us more.""}"
