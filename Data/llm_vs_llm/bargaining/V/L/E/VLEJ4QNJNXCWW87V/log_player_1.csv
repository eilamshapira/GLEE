"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer to Bob:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 510000,
  ""bob_gain"": 490000
}
```

My reasoning is that I'm offering slightly more than half, hoping to secure a quick agreement and avoid the loss of value due to inflation in subsequent rounds. I believe this is a fair opening offer."
