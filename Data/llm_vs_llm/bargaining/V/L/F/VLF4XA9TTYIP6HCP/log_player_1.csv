"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split considering I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept, but also accounting for the 10% inflation penalty I'll face if we go to another round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because while a 50-50 split might seem fair, the 10% inflation penalty I face makes me want to secure a slightly larger portion now. This offer still gives Bob a substantial amount and should be reasonable enough to accept rather than risk further negotiations where the total value decreases."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. Due to inflation, if I reject and wait for the next round, my share would be worth even less (another 10% reduction)
2. The split is still reasonably fair, giving me 45% of the total
3. Fighting over a few hundred dollars more isn't worth the risk of further devaluation of my share
4. There's no guarantee I'd get a better deal in future rounds, especially with the inflation penalty affecting my portion"
