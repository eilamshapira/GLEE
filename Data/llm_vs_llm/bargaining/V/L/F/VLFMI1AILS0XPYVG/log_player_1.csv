"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hey Bob, how about a 60/40 split this round? It's a fair deal to keep things moving forward quickly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. This gives us both an equal share, and since inflation isn't affecting me, I'm comfortable negotiating for a fair division. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your 50/50 suggestion. However, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor this round, taking into account the inflation impact on me. It still ensures you an almost equal share.""}"
