"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, how about a 60/40 split this round? It's a fair deal to keep things moving forward quickly. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing a 60/40 split in her favor. While I would get $40, I need to consider that inflation isn't affecting me (0% per round), so there's no pressure for me to accept immediately. If I reject, I can make my own proposal in the next round which might be more favorable to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. This gives us both an equal share, and since inflation isn't affecting me, I'm comfortable negotiating for a fair division.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your 50/50 suggestion. However, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor this round, taking into account the inflation impact on me. It still ensures you an almost equal share. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has now offered a 55/45 split, which gives me $45. I notice she mentioned inflation is affecting her, with the money she gains now being worth 36% less than in the first round. This means her $55 is effectively worth about $35.2 to her after inflation.

Since inflation doesn't affect me (my $45 maintains its full value), and I get more than I would have in her first offer, this seems reasonable.
