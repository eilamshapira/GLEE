"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for round 1, taking into account the declining value of the money for Bob:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm aiming for a split that's more favorable to me but still acceptable to Bob, considering the initial round. I hope Bob will see this as a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
