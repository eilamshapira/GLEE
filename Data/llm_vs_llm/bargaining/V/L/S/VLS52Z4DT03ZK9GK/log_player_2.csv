"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$
2. This is a 40-60 split in Alice's favor
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
4. There's no inflation penalty for me, so waiting isn't costly
5. Since I can make a better offer next round and there's no cost to waiting, I should reject this somewhat unfair split

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still slightly in my favor since I have some negotiating power:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose this 55-45 split as it's more equitable than Alice's initial offer while giving me a small advantage. It's fair enough that Alice might accept it to avoid further rounds, but not so extreme that it would likely trigger an automatic rejection."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me 4500$ out of 10,000$
2. This is a 45-55 split
3. Due to inflation, Alice's 5500$ is actually worth only 3520$ to her (5500 * 0.64)
4. Alice seems to be more affected by inflation than I am
5. While this offer is better than her first offer (4000$), I know that inflation is hurting Alice more than me
6. I could reject and make another offer next round when inflation will hurt Alice even more, giving me more negotiating power

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that I know Alice is significantly affected by inflation (her money is worth 36% less), I can use this leverage to make a stronger offer in my favor. However, I don't want to be too aggressive as she might still reject if the offer is too unfair:

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

This 60-40 split might be acceptable to Alice now because:
1. Due to inflation, waiting is costly for her
2. Her 4000$ is already devalued by 36%, so further delays would hurt her more
3. This offer still leaves her with a significant portion
4. It's better for her to accept a less favorable deal now than to risk further devaluation"
