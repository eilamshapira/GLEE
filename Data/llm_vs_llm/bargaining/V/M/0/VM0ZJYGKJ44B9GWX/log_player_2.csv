"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. This is a good starting point for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Current offer: $40 for me, $60 for Alice
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less for me (I'll feel each dollar as $0.80)
   * For Alice, it will be worth 5% less (she'll feel each dollar as $0.95)
   * This significantly weakens my negotiating position

The offer is not entirely fair (60-40 split in Alice's favor), but considering:
- The high inflation penalty I face (20% vs Alice's 5%)
- The fact that Alice made a somewhat reasonable opening offer
- The risk of getting worse outcomes in future rounds due to the asymmetric inflation

I think I should accept this offer. Getting $40 now is better than risking getting less value in future rounds due to the steep inflation penalty.
