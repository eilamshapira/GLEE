"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for potential future inflation if the negotiation continues.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while protecting my interests against potential inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. The $50 I would receive is worth 5% less due to inflation, so effectively $47.50 for me
2. This is less than my initial proposal where I would have gotten $55
3. However, if I reject and we go to round 3, my money will be worth another 5% less
4. The split is equal, which is fair in principle
5. Bob seems to be affected more by inflation (20%), so their position might weaken more than mine in future rounds
6. However, there's risk in continuing, and $47.50 equivalent is still a decent outcome

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because while it's less than my initial proposal, the risk of further value loss through inflation makes this a reasonable compromise."
