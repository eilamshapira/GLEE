"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to Bob for dividing the $100.

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer to Bob, considering that the money loses 5% of its value for him each round.

{""alice_gain"": 48, 
""bob_gain"": 52}

Since Bob is affected by inflation (losing 5% value each round), I'm offering him a slightly larger share than myself to account for this. This should be mutually beneficial given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer to Bob, considering the increasing inflation effect on his side.

{""alice_gain"": 45, 
""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm offering Bob a larger share to account for the increasing inflation effect on his end (now at 14.26% less value). This gives him more nominal dollars to offset the decreased purchasing power he's experiencing, while still ensuring I receive a fair portion."
