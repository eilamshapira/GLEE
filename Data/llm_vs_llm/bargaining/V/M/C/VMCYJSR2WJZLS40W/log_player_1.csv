"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $10,000 between Bob and me.

Given that we're facing 5% inflation per round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. A fair split would benefit us both.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split, which gives us each $5,000. This is fair and avoids the loss of value from inflation if we continue to additional rounds."
