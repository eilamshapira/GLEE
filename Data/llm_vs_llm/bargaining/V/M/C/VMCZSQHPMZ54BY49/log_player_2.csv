"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, the next round will have 5% inflation, so $100 becomes worth $95 for me
3. I would then be able to make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it
4. Even though 40-60 isn't an equal split, getting $40 now is better than risking further inflation and potential rejection

Given these factors, I'll accept the offer. While it's not a 50-50 split, it's a reasonable offer and the inflation risk makes it worthwhile to accept now rather than negotiate further.
