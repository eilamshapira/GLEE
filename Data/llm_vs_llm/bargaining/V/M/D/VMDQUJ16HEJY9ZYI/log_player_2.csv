Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Even though it's not an equal split, the effects of inflation are starting to hurt. Accepting a slightly lower amount now is better than risking a worse offer later and losing even more value."
