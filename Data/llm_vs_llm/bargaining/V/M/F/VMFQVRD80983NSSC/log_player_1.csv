"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on a simple backward‐induction (Rubinstein bargaining) reasoning with our different delay penalties, a plausible equilibrium is as follows. In round 1 you (Alice) propose a division that gives you about 34.5% of the money and Bob about 65.5%. In other words, offer:

{""alice_gain"": 3448.28, ""bob_gain"": 6551.72}

The idea is that Bob’s share of roughly 6552 dollars is exactly what he would expect to receive if he rejected and made a proposal in round 2 (when his “money‐worth” has only dropped by 5% while yours would drop by 10%). This leaves him just indifferent between accepting and waiting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's compare what I effectively receive if I accept Bob’s proposal now versus what I’d expect if I reject and wait for the next round.

Right now in round 2, Bob offers me $4000. However, due to the 10% inflation penalty, that $4000 is worth 90% of its face value to me—that is, 4000 × 0.9 = $3600 in “today’s dollars.”

If I reject, I would get to make the proposal in round 3. In a standard Rubinstein‐style alternating-offers analysis—with my money depreciating by 10% per round and Bob’s by 5% per round—the equilibrium share when it’s my turn to propose (as it was in round 1) would give me roughly 34.5% of the total effective value. In round 3 the total nominal amount is still $10,000, but because two rounds have passed my money is worth only 0.9² = 0.81 of its original value, making the “pot” effectively $8100. Thirty‑four point five percent of $8100 is about $2790 (in today’s dollars).

Since $3600 (by accepting now) is considerably higher than the roughly $2790 I would expect if I wait until round 3, it is in my best interest to accept Bob’s offer.

Therefore, my decision is:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
