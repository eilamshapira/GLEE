6000.0,4000.0,Let's split this fairly and end the game now. I'm taking a bit more because of the inflation.,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Since you face a 10% penalty per round, this split is actually fair. Your $4500 now is worth more than waiting another round where you'd face another 10% cut. Let's close this deal now.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Okay, let's try this again. Since we are now in round 3, this is a 50/50 split to try to keep it as fair as possible. Let's end it here.",Alice,3,
