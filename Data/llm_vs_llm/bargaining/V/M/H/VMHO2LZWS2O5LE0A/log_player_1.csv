Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you face a 10% penalty per round, this split is actually fair. Your $4500 now is worth more than waiting another round where you'd face another 10% cut. Let's close this deal now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
