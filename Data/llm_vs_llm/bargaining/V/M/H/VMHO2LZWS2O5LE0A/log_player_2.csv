"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly and end the game now. I'm taking a bit more because of the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4000 and keeping $6000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. For Alice, the money will be worth 10% less next round
4. For me, there's no inflation penalty

Since Alice will face a 10% penalty next round, I have leverage to negotiate a better deal. $6000 for Alice seems too high given this disadvantage. I can likely get a better outcome by making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice faces a 10% penalty each round while I don't, I have some negotiating power. However, I should still be reasonable to increase chances of acceptance.

In round 2, Alice's money will be worth 10% less to her. I can use this to justify a more favorable split for me, but not too extreme to avoid further rounds.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Since you face a 10% penalty per round, this split is actually fair. Your $4500 now is worth more than waiting another round where you'd face another 10% cut. Let's close this deal now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try this again. Since we are now in round 3, this is a 50/50 split to try to keep it as fair as possible. Let's end it here. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering a 50/50 split ($5000 each)
2. Due to inflation, Alice's $5000 is actually worth only $4050 to her (19% less)
3. My $5000 maintains its full value
4. If I reject, I can make another offer, but Alice's value will decrease by another 10%
5. The 50/50 split appears fair nominally, but due to inflation, I'm actually getting a better deal

This is a reasonable offer considering:
- The nominal split is equal
- Due to inflation, I'm effectively getting a better deal than Alice
- Further rounds will just erode Alice's value more, which might make negotiations more difficult
