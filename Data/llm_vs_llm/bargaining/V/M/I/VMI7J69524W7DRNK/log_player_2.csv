"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $200,000 out of the $1,000,000, while she takes $800,000. That's a 20-80 split in her favor.

If I reject and move to the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation, meaning the total effective value for me would be $950,000. However, I would get to make the next proposal.

Given that I can make a more favorable proposal in the next round and the inflation penalty isn't too severe yet, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer to Alice, considering the inflation factor and the fact that we both need to agree.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a more equitable split where I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. This is fair because while Alice has the advantage of no inflation penalty, we both benefit from reaching an agreement quickly. This offer gives Alice a substantial portion while recognizing my position as the current proposer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $250,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is better than her initial offer of $200,000.

Due to inflation, the money is now worth 9.75% less to me, so the $250,000 offered has an effective value of about $225,625 to me. If I reject and move to the next round, the inflation will increase to approximately 14.26% (5% more than the current 9.75%), meaning the entire $1,000,000 would be worth about $857,400 to me.

If I reject, I'll be able to make a new proposal, but Alice has demonstrated she's only willing to increase her offer slightly. Each round we continue, my negotiating position weakens due to the asymmetric inflation.

Considering the inflation penalty is increasing and Alice has shown some willingness to compromise, I'll accept this offer.
