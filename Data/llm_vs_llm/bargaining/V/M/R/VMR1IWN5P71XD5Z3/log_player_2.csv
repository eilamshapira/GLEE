"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $4000, Alice gets $6000
2. If I reject, next round:
   * I can make a counter-offer
   * But the money will be worth 5% less to me (and 10% less to Alice)
   * $4000 now > $4000 * 0.95 = $3800 next round

While I might be able to negotiate a better split next round, the 5% depreciation means I'd need to secure significantly more money to make up for the loss in value. Plus, Alice would be even more motivated to accept due to her 10% depreciation.

$4000 is a reasonable offer - it's 40% of the total, and given the depreciation pressure, it's better to accept now than risk a protracted negotiation.
