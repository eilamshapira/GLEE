We're getting close to the point where Alice's perceived value of the money remaining will lead her to make more and more unfavorable offers. I'm hoping to push for a slightly better deal in the next couple of rounds."

I'm lowering my offer slightly again. It's a calculated risk, but with the increasing inflation for Alice, she may be more inclined to accept a lower offer to avoid walking away with nothing."

It's getting risky now, and this offer is at least somewhat reasonable considering the inflation. Accepting now guarantees I get something."
