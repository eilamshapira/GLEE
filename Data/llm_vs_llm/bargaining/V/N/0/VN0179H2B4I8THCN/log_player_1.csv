"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the 10% inflation penalty I face in each round. Since this is the first round, there's no inflation impact yet.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split. This is fair and gives both of us an equal share, and I hope Bob will accept it to avoid the inflation penalty in subsequent rounds."
