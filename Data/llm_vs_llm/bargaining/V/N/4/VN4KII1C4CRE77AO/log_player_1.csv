"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll play as Alice in this game where we need to divide $100 between us. Since we're starting the first round and I'm making the initial proposal, I'll try to be fair while looking out for my interests.

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50}

I suggest an equal split of the money, which is the fairest approach. We both walk away with $50, and there's no need to extend the negotiation with the risk of inflation affecting one or both of us."
