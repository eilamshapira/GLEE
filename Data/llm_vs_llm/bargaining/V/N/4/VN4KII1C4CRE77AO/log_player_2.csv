"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. The offer is a 50-50 split, which is fair at face value
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, if I wait until next round:
   - A $50 offer now is worth more than any amount up to $62.50 in the next round
   - I have no guarantee Alice will accept my counter-offer
4. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush, especially with inflation
