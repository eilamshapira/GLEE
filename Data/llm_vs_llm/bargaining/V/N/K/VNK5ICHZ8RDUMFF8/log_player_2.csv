"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is extremely unfair, offering me only $1 out of $1,000,000. I will make a counter-proposal in the next round that is more equitable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a fair and equal split of the money. This way, both Alice and I benefit equally from the deal. A 50-50 split is the most equitable solution and should be acceptable to both parties."
