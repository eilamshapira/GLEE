550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. Keep in mind that with 5% inflation per round, this deal is better for both of us than negotiating further. If we go to the next round, the total value drops to $950000, which means we'd both get less. Let's settle now and both walk away with a good amount.",Alice,1,

475000.0,525000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a more equitable split would be beneficial for both of us. Considering the inflation rate you mentioned, my proposal of $525000 for me and $475000 for you still keeps us close to a fair division while accounting for the reduced value in the next round. Let's agree on this and avoid further loss in value.",Bob,2,
