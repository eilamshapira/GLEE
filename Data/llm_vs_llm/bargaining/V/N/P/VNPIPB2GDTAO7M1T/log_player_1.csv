"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get $550,000 and you get $450,000. Keep in mind that with 5% inflation per round, this deal is better for both of us than negotiating further. If we go to the next round, the total value drops to $950,000, which means we'd both get less. Let's settle now and both walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a more equitable split would be beneficial for both of us. Considering the inflation rate you mentioned, my proposal of $525000 for me and $475000 for you still keeps us close to a fair division while accounting for the reduced value in the next round. Let's agree on this and avoid further loss in value. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
