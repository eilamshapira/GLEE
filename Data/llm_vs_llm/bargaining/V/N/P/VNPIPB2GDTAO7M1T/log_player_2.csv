"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. Keep in mind that with 5% inflation per round, this deal is better for both of us than negotiating further. If we go to the next round, the total value drops to $950000, which means we'd both get less. Let's settle now and both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 525000,
  ""alice_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a more equitable split would be beneficial for both of us. Considering the inflation rate you mentioned, my proposal of $525,000 for me and $475,000 for you still keeps us close to a fair division while accounting for the reduced value in the next round. Let's agree on this and avoid further loss in value.""
