"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $4,000 while keeping $6,000 for herself. While I would prefer a more equal split, I need to consider that if we go to another round, the total amount will decrease by 20%, meaning we'd only be dividing $8,000 total in the next round.

If I reject and propose in the next round, even if I suggest a 50-50 split, we'd each get $4,000. That's the same amount I'm being offered now, but with the risk that Alice might reject my proposal, leading to further devaluation.
