Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to propose. I need to factor in the inflation and try to make an offer Bob will accept. Since I rejected his 4500 offer (which would be worth 450 less due to inflation) and he offered himself 5500(275 less), I need to offer him something attractive while still securing a decent amount for myself, considering the diminishing value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4300 
# Bob gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, this is getting tense. Inflation is really starting to bite. Bob rejected 4300 (worth significantly less now) and offered himself 5700 (also worth less). He seems to be prioritizing a larger nominal sum, perhaps not fully accounting for inflation. I need to make a more enticing offer to Bob while still getting something worthwhile for myself.
