600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob! I'm offering you a fair $400000 while I take $600000. Consider that if you reject, your share will be worth 5% less next round. Let's make a deal now and both walk away happy.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
490000.0,510000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting me, I'd like to propose a division of $510000 for me and $490000 for you. This way, we both get a fair share, and I can compensate for the value loss I'm experiencing. Let's settle this round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, let's be practical. Your share is already worth 10% less due to inflation. If we continue further rounds, your position will only weaken. This offer of $350000 for you is actually better than a larger amount in future rounds when inflation will have eaten away more value. Let's conclude this now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
470000.0,530000.0,"Alice, I understand your perspective, but considering the cumulative inflation for me, I need to secure a bit more. How about I take $530000 and you take $470000? This still leaves you with a significant amount, and we can both walk away satisfied.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, let's look at the numbers clearly. Due to the 19% inflation affecting you, even a smaller amount now is better than a larger amount later. This $300000 for you is still worth more than what you'd get after more rounds of inflation. My position strengthens each round while yours weakens. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, given the compounding inflation, I need to ensure I get a reasonable amount. Let's settle on $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This still gives you a substantial share, and we can both end this before the value diminishes further for me.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, we need to be realistic. After 6 rounds, your money has lost over 25% of its value. Even if you got a larger amount in future rounds, it would be worth even less to you. This $250000 now is actually worth more to you than $400000 would be several rounds from now. The math is clear - this is your best option to maximize your actual value.",Alice,7,
