"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob's money loses 5% value each round while mine doesn't depreciate.

{""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm offering you a fair $400,000 while I take $600,000. Consider that if you reject, your share will be worth 5% less next round. Let's make a deal now and both walk away happy.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting me, I'd like to propose a division of $510000 for me and $490000 for you. This way, we both get a fair share, and I can compensate for the value loss I'm experiencing. Let's settle this round. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob is offering me $490,000, which is less than my initial offer for myself
2. If I reject, Bob's money will depreciate another 5% next round
3. However, I have strong negotiating power since my money doesn't lose value
4. We still have 10 rounds left, and Bob's position will weaken with each round
5. I can likely get a better deal by rejecting this offer

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's money has already depreciated by 10% over two rounds, I'll adjust my offer accordingly but still maintain a strong position.

{""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. Your share is already worth 10% less due to inflation. If we continue further rounds, your position will only weaken. This offer of $350,000 for you is actually better than a larger amount in future rounds when inflation will have eaten away more value. Let's conclude this now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but considering the cumulative inflation for me, I need to secure a bit more. How about I take $530000 and you take $470000? This still leaves you with a significant amount, and we can both walk away satisfied. 
# Alice gain: 470000 
# Bob gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob is still not fully acknowledging his weakening position
2. His $530,000 is actually worth only about $454,422 to him due to the 14.26% inflation
3. We still have 8 rounds left
4. Each round makes Bob's position worse while mine stays strong
5. I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate
6. Bob's offers haven't changed dramatically enough to reflect his deteriorating position

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Given that Bob's money has now depreciated by about 19% (after 4 rounds), I'll make an offer that reflects this reality.

{""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's look at the numbers clearly. Due to the 19% inflation affecting you, even a smaller amount now is better than a larger amount later. This $300,000 for you is still worth more than what you'd get after more rounds of inflation. My position strengthens each round while yours weakens. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the compounding inflation, I need to ensure I get a reasonable amount. Let's settle on $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This still gives you a substantial share, and we can both end this before the value diminishes further for me. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob is still not making realistic offers given his weakening position
2. His $550,000 is actually only worth about $425,910 to him due to 22.62% inflation
3. We still have 6 rounds left
4. My negotiating position continues to strengthen while his weakens
5. Bob seems to be making increasingly desperate offers that don't reflect the reality of the situation
6. The game theory strongly favors waiting for a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With Bob's money now having depreciated by over 25% after 6 rounds, I'll make an offer that reflects this reality while still giving him a chance to make a rational decision.

{""alice_gain"": 750000,
""bob_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""Bob, we need to be realistic. After 6 rounds, your money has lost over 25% of its value. Even if you got a larger amount in future rounds, it would be worth even less to you. This $250,000 now is actually worth more to you than $400,000 would be several rounds from now. The math is clear - this is your best option to maximize your actual value.""}"
