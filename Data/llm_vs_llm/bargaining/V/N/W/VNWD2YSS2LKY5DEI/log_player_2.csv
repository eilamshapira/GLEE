Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering you a fair $400000 while I take $600000. Consider that if you reject, your share will be worth 5% less next round. Let's make a deal now and both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting me, I'd like to propose a division of $510,000 for me and $490,000 for you. This way, we both get a fair share, and I can compensate for the value loss I'm experiencing. Let's settle this round.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. Your share is already worth 10% less due to inflation. If we continue further rounds, your position will only weaken. This offer of $350000 for you is actually better than a larger amount in future rounds when inflation will have eaten away more value. Let's conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

How about I take $530,000 and you take $470,000? This still leaves you with a significant amount, and we can both walk away satisfied.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's look at the numbers clearly. Due to the 19% inflation affecting you, even a smaller amount now is better than a larger amount later. This $300000 for you is still worth more than what you'd get after more rounds of inflation. My position strengthens each round while yours weakens. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

Round 6

Let's settle on $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. This still gives you a substantial share, and we can both end this before the value diminishes further for me.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to be realistic. After 6 rounds, your money has lost over 25% of its value. Even if you got a larger amount in future rounds, it would be worth even less to you. This $250000 now is actually worth more to you than $400000 would be several rounds from now. The math is clear - this is your best option to maximize your actual value. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000
