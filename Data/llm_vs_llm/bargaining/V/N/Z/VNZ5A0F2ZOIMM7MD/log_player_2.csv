"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $400,000, which is 40% of the total money, while she would get $600,000 (60%). While this isn't an even split, I need to consider the 5% inflation penalty I face each round if I reject.

If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value to me would be reduced by 5%, meaning the $1,000,000 would be worth $950,000 to me. Even if I were to propose a more favorable split in the next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation penalties for me.

Given that $400,000 is a substantial amount and the risk of diminishing returns in future rounds due to inflation, I'll accept this offer.
