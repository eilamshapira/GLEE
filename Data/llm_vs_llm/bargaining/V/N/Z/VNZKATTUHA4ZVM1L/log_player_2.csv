"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into consideration.

In round 1, the total value for me was $1,000,000. Now, it's worth $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000 for me.
For Alice, the total value was $1,000,000. Now, it's worth $1,000,000 * 0.80 = $800,000 for her.

Considering this, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, still better for you 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of the offer considering inflation.

For me, the money is worth 5% less in round 1, and another 5% less in round 2, and another 5% less is not accurate, it is 5% in round 1, then 4.75% in round 2 (5% of 950000 is 47500,  950000 - 47500 = 902500, then 5% of 902500 is 45125, so 902500 - 45125 = 857375, then the total decrease is 1000000 - 857375 = 142625, 142625/1000000 = 0.142625 or 14.2625%, but the problem stated 9.75%, I will use the problem statement), so the money I gain is worth $420,000 * (1 - 0.0975) = $420,000 * 0.9025 = $379,050.
For Alice, the money is worth 20% less in round 1, and another 16% less in round 2 (20% of 1000000 is 200000, 1000000 - 200000 = 800000, then 20% of 800000 is 160000, 800000 - 160000 = 640000, then the total decrease is 1000000 - 640000 = 360000, 360000/1000000 = 0.36 or 36%, I will use the problem statement), so the money Alice gains is worth $580,000 * (1 - 0.36) = $580,000 * 0.64 = $371,200.

Considering this, I'll decide whether to accept or reject the offer.
