"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $10,000.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

I think this is a fair starting offer where I get slightly more than half, considering I'll be affected by 10% inflation if we continue to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
