"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slight advantage for myself, but keeping it reasonable so Bob is likely to accept. We're also in Round 1, so the full value of the money is there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Reasoning: Even though the money is worth less, I'm still rejecting. $4000 with 10% less value is $3600. I believe I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. Remember the money is now worth 20% less than in round 1. I'll try to be more generous this time, but still keep some advantage for myself.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""bob_gain"": 4700
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer of $4200. With the 27.1% reduction, that's $4200 * (1 - 0.271) = $4200 * 0.729 = $3061.80.

It's getting lower, but still... I think I can get a bit more.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn. The money is now worth 34.39% less than in round 1. I'm starting to get worried, so I need to be more reasonable.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```"
