"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. The total amount is $1,000,000
2. Alice is offering me $450,000 (45%) and keeping $550,000 (55%)
3. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round
4. My $450,000 now is worth more than $480,000 in the next round (after 20% depreciation)
5. While the split isn't perfectly equal, it's reasonably fair

Given that:
- The offer is fairly close to 50-50
- Waiting will significantly reduce the value for me (20% loss)
- There's risk in negotiation
- I'd be giving up guaranteed $450,000
