Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This round highlights the impact of inflation. While I proposed a 55/45 split in my favor last round, Alice's current offer of 45/55 is now more appealing. Accepting a slightly less favorable split is better than risking further inflation and potentially getting a much worse deal later."
