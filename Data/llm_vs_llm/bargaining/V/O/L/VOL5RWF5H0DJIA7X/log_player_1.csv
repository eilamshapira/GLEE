"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll play as Alice and propose an offer to divide $100 with Bob.

Considering the inflation factor (my money loses 20% value each round while Bob's only loses 5%), it's in my interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. I should propose a fair offer that Bob would likely accept.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering this split because while an even 50-50 split would be perfectly fair, the asymmetric inflation rates give me an incentive to secure a deal in the first round. The 55-45 split is still reasonably fair while giving me a slight advantage, and Bob should recognize that rejecting this offer could lead to worse outcomes for both of us due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While I initially proposed a 55-45 split in my favor, Bob's counteroffer of 50-50 is fair. Given that inflation affects me more severely (20% per round) than it affects Bob (5% per round), it's in my best interest to accept this reasonable offer now rather than continue to another round where my potential gains would be worth even less."
