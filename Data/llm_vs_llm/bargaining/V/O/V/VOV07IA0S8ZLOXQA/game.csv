60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Note that with each round, inflation hits me harder (20%) than you (10%), so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.",Alice,1,

35.0,65.0,"Alice, I understand inflation impacts us differently. I propose a more favorable split for me, but still ensure you get a good share. Let's end this quickly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I'm meeting you in the middle. With inflation, if this goes to round 5, I'll effectively lose over 40% of value while you'll only lose about 25%. A 55-45 split is fair given the asymmetric inflation penalty. Let's close this deal now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, I'm willing to be slightly more generous given the inflation. Let's make this work with a 60/40 split now, before the value diminishes further.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, I'm now offering a perfectly even split. This is fair for both of us, especially considering I'm losing value faster than you with each round. At this point, my $50 is worth much less to me than it would have been in round 1. Please accept so we can both walk away with something worthwhile.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, I believe we're approaching a point where further negotiation harms us both significantly. Given the ongoing inflation, I propose a 55/45 split. This allows us both to preserve a decent amount of the initial value.",Bob,6,
