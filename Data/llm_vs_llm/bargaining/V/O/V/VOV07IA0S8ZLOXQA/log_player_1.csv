"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Note that with each round, inflation hits me harder (20%) than you (10%), so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.""}"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand inflation impacts us differently. I propose a more favorable split for me, but still ensure you get a good share. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm meeting you in the middle. With inflation, if this goes to round 5, I'll effectively lose over 40% of value while you'll only lose about 25%. A 55-45 split is fair given the asymmetric inflation penalty. Let's close this deal now.""}"

This is fair for both of us, especially considering I'm losing value faster than you with each round. At this point, my $50 is worth much less to me than it would have been in round 1. Please accept so we can both walk away with something worthwhile.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I believe we're approaching a point where further negotiation harms us both significantly. Given the ongoing inflation, I propose a 55/45 split. This allows us both to preserve a decent amount of the initial value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
