"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Note that with each round, inflation hits me harder (20%) than you (10%), so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm meeting you in the middle. With inflation, if this goes to round 5, I'll effectively lose over 40% of value while you'll only lose about 25%. A 55-45 split is fair given the asymmetric inflation penalty. Let's close this deal now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to be slightly more generous given the inflation. Let's make this work with a 60/40 split now, before the value diminishes further.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm now offering a perfectly even split. This is fair for both of us, especially considering I'm losing value faster than you with each round. At this point, my $50 is worth much less to me than it would have been in round 1. Please accept so we can both walk away with something worthwhile.

# Alice gain: 50
