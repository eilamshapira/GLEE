"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a reasonable first offer to Bob, considering that inflation will reduce the value by 20% each round if we don't reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose taking $60 for myself and giving $40 to Bob. This is a slightly favorable split for me but still gives Bob a significant portion. Since we're in the first round, the money has its full value, and it would be wise for Bob to seriously consider this offer rather than risk value loss through inflation in subsequent rounds."
