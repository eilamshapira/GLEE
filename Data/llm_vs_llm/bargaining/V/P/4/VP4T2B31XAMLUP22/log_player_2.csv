"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I hope you’re doing well. To avoid any needless delay (and the 10% inflation hit on my side in later rounds), I propose we divide the $10000 equally—$5000 each. I believe a fair split right away benefits us both. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
