"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me 4000$, which is less than half of the total amount, I need to consider the impact of inflation. If I reject and move to the next round, the value of my share would decrease by 20% due to inflation. Let me evaluate if making a counter-offer would be beneficial.

If I reject now, the 10,000$ will be worth 8,000$ to me in the next round. Even if I propose a more favorable split in the next round, the maximum I could theoretically get would be 8,000$, and Alice might not accept that.

Since 4,000$ now is better than potentially getting less later due to inflation, I should accept this offer.
