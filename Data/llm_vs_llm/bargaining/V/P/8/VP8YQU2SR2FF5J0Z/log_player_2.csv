Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4784 
# Alice gain: 5216 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether to accept Alice's offer, let's calculate the actual value of the money for me after considering inflation.

The money is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. So, the actual value of my gain would be:

\$4784 * (1 - 0.4686) = \$4784 * 0.5314 = \$2542.77

Given that the value of the money decreases significantly with each round due to inflation, it might be better to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation.
