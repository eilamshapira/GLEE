"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I take 60%, you take 40%. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get 4000$ out of the 10,000$, which is 40%. This isn't an equal split, but I need to factor in the 5% inflation penalty per round if I reject.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the total value would be worth 5% less to me. I should be strategic here - while I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty works against me with each passing round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced offer while accounting for the inflation risk.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both equal shares of $5000. Given the inflation penalty I face with each round, this is a reasonable compromise that benefits us both equally.""}"
