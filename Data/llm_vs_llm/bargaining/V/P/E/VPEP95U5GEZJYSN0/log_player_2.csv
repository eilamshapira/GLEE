Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me (Bob) with each passing round, and 5% less for Alice, I'll take that into account for my offer.

For me (Bob), the $1,000,000 is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000.
For Alice, the $1,000,000 is still worth $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000.

Considering this, I'll make a fair offer.
