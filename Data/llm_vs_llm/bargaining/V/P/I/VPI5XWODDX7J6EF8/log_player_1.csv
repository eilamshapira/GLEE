"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to consider the inflation effect on my gains. Here's my first offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slightly advantageous position to account for potential inflation impact on my side in later rounds. I'm hoping Bob will accept a reasonable offer early on to avoid the risk of the money losing value."
