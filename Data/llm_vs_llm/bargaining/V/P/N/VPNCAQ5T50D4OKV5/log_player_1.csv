"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting a larger share, but I'm aiming for something more equitable. How about a 45/55 split? 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $5500, but it's worth 10% less than the original value, so I'll effectively get $5500 * 0.9 = $4950.

Since Bob's offer is relatively close to a 50/50 split and considering the decreasing value of the money, I think it's a reasonable offer.
