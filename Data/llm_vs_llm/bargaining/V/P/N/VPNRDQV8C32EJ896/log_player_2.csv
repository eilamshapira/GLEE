"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's take a fair share before inflation hits! I propose a slightly better deal for me, but still a great deal for you. Let's accept this in the first round. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if Alice's offer of $490,000 for me and $510,000 for her is fair.

Alice is offering me 49% of the total, which is close to an even split. If I reject and we go to the next round, the total amount will decrease by 20% (worth only $800,000). Even if I offered myself a larger percentage in the next round, I'd need to get more than 61.25% of the remaining $800,000 just to exceed what Alice is offering me now.

Given that this is a reasonable first offer and inflation will significantly reduce our potential earnings with each passing round, I'll accept.
