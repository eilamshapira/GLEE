"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to make an offer to divide $1,000,000 with Bob, considering that each round makes the money worth 20% less to me, while its value doesn't decrease for Bob. This gives Bob a significant advantage in later rounds, so I should make a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for myself since I'm going first, but it's still quite fair to Bob. With the 20% inflation penalty for me in future rounds, Bob has leverage if we continue, so I'm offering him a substantial portion upfront to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Bob's offer considering the inflation penalty I face.

If I accept Bob's offer now:
- I get $500,000, but it's worth 20% less to me due to round 2 inflation
- So my effective value is $500,000 Ã— 0.8 = $400,000

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3:
- The money would be worth another 20% less to me (60% of original value)
- Bob has no inflation penalty and can afford to wait
- I would need to offer Bob significantly more to get him to accept

Given that Bob moved from my proposed 45% to an even 50-50 split, and considering my disadvantage with increasing inflation, this is actually a reasonable offer.
