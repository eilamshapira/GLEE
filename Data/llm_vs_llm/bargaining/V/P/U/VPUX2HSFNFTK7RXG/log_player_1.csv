"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I take a bit more, but you still get a fair share. Let's settle to avoid more losses. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the actual value of the offer.

The original value of $45 is now worth $45 * 0.8 = $36 to me.

Considering this, I think I can try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 20% less in each round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less in each round.

In Round 1, the value was 100%.
In Round 2, the value for me was 80%, and for Bob, it was 95%.
In Round 3, the value for me will be 80% * 0.8 = 64%, and for Bob, it will be 95% * 0.95 = 90.25%.

To make my offer more attractive, I'll give Bob a bit more, considering the value for him is still relatively high.

{""alice_gain"": 42, 
""bob_gain"": 58, 
""message"": ""Let's settle before inflation reduces our gains further.""}"
