"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 50-50. It's the most equitable way to divide the money. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which is $500,000 for each of us. While this is a fair offer, in game theory, being the proposer in the next round could give me an advantage. However, there's also risk in rejecting a fair offer - Alice might propose a less favorable split in later rounds.

Given that:
1. The offer is perfectly fair
2. We have a limited number of rounds
3. There's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree
4. A 50-50 split is a commonly accepted fair solution

I'll accept this offer. It's fair, reasonable, and guarantees a good outcome for both parties.
