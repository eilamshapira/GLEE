"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that acknowledges both inflation concerns and fairness.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering you a slightly larger share because I face a 5% inflation penalty in each round. If we agree now, we both walk away with substantial amounts rather than risking future devaluation or potentially getting nothing after 12 rounds."
