"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer carefully:

1) Alice is offering me $450,000 and taking $550,000
2) If I reject, I can make a counteroffer in Round 2
3) However, inflation means the money will be worth 5% less to me next round
4) $450,000 now vs potentially more in later rounds with inflation

Let me calculate: If I reject, the total value to me next round would be $950,000 (5% less). I'd need to secure more than $450,000 to make rejection worthwhile.

Since this is a reasonable first offer and inflation will reduce the value each round, I'll accept.
