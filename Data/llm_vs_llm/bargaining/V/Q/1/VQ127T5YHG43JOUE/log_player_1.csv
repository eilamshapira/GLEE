"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll approach this game with a bit of strategy, considering the inflation factor of 20% per round for me.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering Bob a substantial amount of $450,000 while keeping $550,000 for myself. This is a fair initial offer that gives Bob a significant portion while acknowledging that I need to secure a good amount in the first round due to the inflation penalty I'll face if we continue to additional rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to be strategic since the money is now worth 40% less to me than in round 1. I'll offer Bob a better deal to try to reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a completely even 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair and balanced offer that gives us both equal shares. Given the inflation effect I'm experiencing, it's important for me to close the deal now rather than risk further devaluation of my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money now worth nearly 60% less to me than in round 1, I need to make a compelling offer to close this deal.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I'm offering Bob $550,000 while keeping $450,000 for myself. This gives Bob the majority of the money and should be appealing enough to accept. Given the significant inflation penalties I'm facing, it's crucial that we reach an agreement now rather than continuing further rounds where my share will continue to lose value."

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000
