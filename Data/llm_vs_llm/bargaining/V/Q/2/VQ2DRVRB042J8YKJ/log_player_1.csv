"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll play as Alice in this game of dividing $1,000,000 with Bob.

Since I know that Bob faces a 5% inflation penalty per round while I face no inflation, I have a strategic advantage. If Bob rejects my offer, his potential gains in the next round will be worth less to him. This gives me some leverage in making my initial offer.

Given this asymmetry, I'll propose a division that's favorable to me but still attractive enough for Bob to accept rather than moving to the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is slightly less than half, but accepting this now is better for him than rejecting and facing 5% inflation on any amount he might get in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. This is a reasonable counteroffer that gives me $525,000, which is still more than half of the total amount. While I could reject and make another offer, Bob would then face further inflation, which might make him more aggressive in the next round. This division is favorable to me and represents a good compromise."
