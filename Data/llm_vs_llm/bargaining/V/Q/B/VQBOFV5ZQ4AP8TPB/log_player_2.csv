"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. If I reject and go to the next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * My $500,000 would effectively become worth $400,000
   * Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, I'm already at a disadvantage

This is actually a fair first offer, and due to the inflation penalty I face, accepting now is better than trying to negotiate for more in subsequent rounds where my share would be devalued.
