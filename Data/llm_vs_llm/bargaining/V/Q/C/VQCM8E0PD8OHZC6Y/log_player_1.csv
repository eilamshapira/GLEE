Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the 5% decrease in value for me in each round, and that this is the second decrease, the total value decrease for me is 10% (1 - 0.95^2). 
However, I'll make an offer that still tries to be fair, but also takes into account the decreasing value for me.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the 5% decrease in value for me in each round, and that this is the third decrease (after round 2 and round 4, since I made an offer in round 3 and round 1), but actually the fourth round has passed, so the value has decreased by 5% four times: 
1 * 0.95^4 = 0.8145, which means the money I gain is worth approximately 18.55% less than in the first round.

I'll make an offer that tries to balance my decreasing value with a reasonable split.
