"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split: $5,000 for each of us.

I need to consider the inflation factor: for me, there's no inflation (0%), but for Alice, the money loses 5% value each round. This means if we go to another round, the total value for Alice decreases, giving me more leverage in negotiations.

If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-offer in the next round where the $10,000 will still be worth $10,000 to me, but only $9,500 to Alice. This gives me an advantage in negotiation.

With this in mind, a 50-50 split isn't the optimal outcome for me given the game's structure.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my offer considering the inflation asymmetry. Since Alice faces 5% inflation per round but I don't, I can propose a split that reflects this dynamic while still being reasonably attractive to Alice.

Given that we're now in round 2, Alice values the $10,000 at only $9,500. If we go to round 3, it would be worth even less to her ($9,025). This gives me negotiating leverage, but I should still make an offer that Alice would reasonably accept to avoid extending the game.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose I receive $5,500 and Alice receives $4,500. This is slightly better for me than a 50-50 split, accounting for the asymmetric inflation, while still being fair enough that Alice should prefer accepting now rather than continuing to round 3 where her value would decrease further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer.

Alice is offering me $4,800 and keeping $5,200 for herself. However, I need to consider the inflation dynamics:
- For me, there's no inflation (0%), so $4,800 is worth exactly $4,800
- For Alice, due to the cumulative inflation of 9.75% in round 3, her $5,200 is actually worth about $4,693 in round 1 value

If I reject this offer, we'll move to round 4, where I could make a new proposal. Alice's inflation would increase to approximately 14.76% (compounding 5% three times), giving me even more leverage.

Given that Alice's current proposal gives her an effective advantage when accounting for inflation, and considering that my position strengthens with each round, I should reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now that we're in round 4, Alice's inflation has increased further. She now values the money at approximately 14.76% less than in round 1. This means the $10,000 is effectively worth only about $8,524 to her, while it's still worth the full $10,000 to me.

Given this asymmetry and the fact that we've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation, I'll make an offer that acknowledges the inflation pressure on Alice while seeking a better deal for myself compared to the initial 50-50 split.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose I receive $6,000 and Alice receives $4,000. This offer accounts for the inflation asymmetry while still providing Alice with a substantial amount. From Alice's perspective, her $4,000 is worth around $3,410 in round 1 value, but if she rejects and we go to round 5, her inflation will increase further to approximately 19.5%, making any future negotiations potentially worse for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5400 
# Alice gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer in round 5:

Alice is offering me $5,400 and taking $4,600 for herself. With the current inflation:
- For me, the $5,400 is worth exactly $5,400 (no inflation)
- For Alice, due to 18.55% inflation, her $4,600 is actually worth about $3,747 in round 1 value

This is now a better deal for me than the initial 50-50 split. Alice has moved significantly from her initial position, offering me 54% of the money.

If I reject, we move to round 6, where Alice's inflation would increase to approximately 23% (compounding another 5%), giving me even more leverage. However, there's always the risk of prolonging negotiations too far.

Given that Alice has now offered me a majority share that accounts for some of the inflation asymmetry, and that this is significantly better than her previous offers, I'll accept this offer.
