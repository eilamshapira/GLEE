"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","To start, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money decreases in value over rounds, it's beneficial to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Considering the inflation rates, I'll propose a split that slightly favors me to account for the higher depreciation rate I face, but still keeps the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the offer from Bob, let's calculate the actual value actually received, considering the inflation.

For me (Alice), the $400,000 offered is worth 20% less than its face value due to inflation. So, its actual value to me is 400,000 * 0.8 = $320,000.

For Bob, the $600,000 he proposes to keep is worth 5% less to him, so its actual value to him is 600,000 * 0.95 = $570,000.

Considering this, the offer seems to favor Bob significantly. Given the substantial decrease in value for me and the relatively minor decrease for Bob, I think it's in my best interest to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a more balanced distribution before the value decreases further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that the money's value continues to decrease, and considering the previous offers and rejections, I'll aim for a more balanced split that takes into account the inflation rates affecting both of us. Since the value for me decreases more significantly with each round, I need to ensure I secure a substantial amount early on.

However, to make the offer more appealing to Bob and considering he rejected my initial offer and then made a less favorable counteroffer, I'll adjust my proposal to be slightly more generous to him than my initial offer, while still accounting for the inflation disparity.
