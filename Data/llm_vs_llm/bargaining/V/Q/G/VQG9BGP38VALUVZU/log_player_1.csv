"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to Bob for the division of $100.

Given that inflation affects my money at 10% per round and Bob's at 5% per round, I should consider that time passing is more costly for me than for Bob. I should make a reasonable offer that Bob will likely accept to avoid future rounds where my share would be worth less.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this division because it gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob should accept it. If we go to another round, inflation would reduce the value of my share more than Bob's, which gives him some leverage. This balanced offer respects both of our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully, accounting for the inflation effects.

If I accept Bob's offer now:
- I get $45, but it's worth 10% less than in round 1, so effectively worth $40.50 to me
- Bob gets $55, which is worth 5% less to him than in round 1, so effectively $52.25 to him

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3:
- The money will be worth even less (20% less for me, 10% less for Bob compared to round 1)
- Any eventual split would have to be significantly better for me to overcome this inflation penalty

Given that the inflation rate affects me more severely than Bob, and the difference between our original offers isn't extreme, accepting now is likely better than continuing to negotiate with increasing penalties.
