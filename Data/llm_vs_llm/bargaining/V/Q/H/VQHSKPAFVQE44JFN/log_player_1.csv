"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a split that takes into account the different inflation rates affecting both players. Since Bob's money devalues faster (20% per round) compared to my 5% per round, he has more incentive to accept an early offer.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because it gives Bob a significant portion while still being favorable to me. The 60-40 split is common in negotiations and might be seen as reasonable enough for Bob to accept rather than risk greater devaluation of his share in future rounds."
