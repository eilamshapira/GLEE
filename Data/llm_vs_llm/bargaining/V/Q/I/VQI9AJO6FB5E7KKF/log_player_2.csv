"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. 

With Alice's offer, I would get $400,000 in the first round. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me. So in round 2, the maximum value I could get would be effectively worth $900,000 (due to 10% inflation from my perspective).

While $400,000 is less than half, getting it now without inflation impact is substantial. However, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal since I have room to work with before inflation significantly erodes my position.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I should propose something that's both favorable to me but also likely to be accepted by Alice, considering she would face no inflation penalty in the next round.

Given that Alice's first offer was 60/40 in her favor, I'll propose a more balanced split, but still giving her a decent portion to make it attractive.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000}

This is a reasonable offer that gives me a slight majority while still being fair to Alice. If she rejects, she can counter-offer in the next round, but I will face another 10% inflation penalty on whatever amount we agree to then."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's current offer is $420,000 for me
2. Due to 19% inflation, this $420,000 is actually worth $340,200 to me (420,000 * 0.81)
3. If I reject and we continue to next round:
   - Inflation will increase to 27.1% for me
   - I can make another offer, but even if I got the whole million, it would be worth only $729,000 to me
   - Alice would likely reject an extremely unbalanced offer anyway

Alice has slightly improved her initial offer (from 400k to 420k), showing some willingness to negotiate. However, inflation is significantly eating into my potential gains. While I might be able to negotiate for a bit more, the risk of further inflation damage is becoming concerning.
