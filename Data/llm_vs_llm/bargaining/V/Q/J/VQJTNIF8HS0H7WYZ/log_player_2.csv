"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   - For me, money will be worth 5% less next round
   - For Alice, money will be worth 10% less next round
4. If I reject, my $40 would become worth $38 next round
5. Alice's $60 would become worth $54 next round

While the split isn't perfectly fair (60-40 in Alice's favor), the inflation penalty makes rejecting risky. If I make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it, and we'd both lose value. The current offer gives me a decent share, and accepting now ensures we don't lose value to inflation.
