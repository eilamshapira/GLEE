"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll play as Alice in this game. Given the presence of inflation that reduces the value by 10% each round for me, it's strategically important to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose an equal split of the $100 - $50 for each of us. This is a fair division that respects both our interests. Given that inflation will reduce my potential gain in future rounds, I believe an equitable split now would be beneficial for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $40 for me and $60 for him. Even though it's not an equal split, I need to consider the inflation effects. If I reject and we move to round 3, my share would be worth another 10% less. Given that Bob is also experiencing inflation (at 20% per round), this offer is reasonable under the circumstances. Taking $40 now is better than potentially getting less value in future rounds."
