520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, I see that inflation is affecting you more severely (20% per round vs. my 10%). This revised offer gives you $480000, which is worth more to you now than my previous offer. If we continue to the next round, you'll lose another 20% of value. This is the most favorable split for both of us considering our different inflation rates.",Alice,3,
