Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my first offer to Bob, considering the inflation effect.

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a generous $450,000. Remember that if you reject, we both face inflation. I'm suggesting a fair split that acknowledges this risk - you get nearly half now, guaranteed, rather than risking value loss in future rounds.""

# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I'm making a reasonable offer. Let's settle this before further value loss. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I see that inflation is affecting you more severely (20% per round vs. my 10%). This revised offer gives you $480,000, which is worth more to you now than my previous offer. If we continue to the next round, you'll lose another 20% of value. This is the most favorable split for both of us considering our different inflation rates.""
