"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a generous $450000. Remember that if you reject, we both face inflation. I'm suggesting a fair split that acknowledges this risk - you get nearly half now, guaranteed, rather than risking value loss in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual value I'm considering is $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the reduced value. I'll offer Alice $350,000 out of the original $1,000,000, which is roughly 43.75% of the reduced value ($800,000).

Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 650000, 
""alice_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm making a reasonable offer. Let's settle this before further value loss.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see that inflation is affecting you more severely (20% per round vs. my 10%). This revised offer gives you $480000, which is worth more to you now than my previous offer. If we continue to the next round, you'll lose another 20% of value. This is the most favorable split for both of us considering our different inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
