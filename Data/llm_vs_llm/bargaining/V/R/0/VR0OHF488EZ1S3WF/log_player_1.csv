"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer for the first round.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose that I (Alice) receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. This is a 60-40 split that gives both of us a substantial amount, but acknowledges that I need to account for the 20% inflation penalty if we go to another round."
