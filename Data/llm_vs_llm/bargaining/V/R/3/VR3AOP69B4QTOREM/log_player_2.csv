"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider this offer from Alice. She's proposing an even 50-50 split of the $10,000, which would give us each $5,000.

This is a fair offer that aligns with principles of equity. If I reject, we move to the next round where the money will be worth 10% less (so only $9,000 total), and I'd need to make a better proposal that Alice would accept.

Given that this is a completely fair split and any delay reduces our total amount, it makes sense to accept.
