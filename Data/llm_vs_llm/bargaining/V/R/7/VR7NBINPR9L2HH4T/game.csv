5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose an even split: $5000 for you and $5000 for me. By accepting now, we both avoid any further complications from inflation (which affects me by 10% each round). I believe a fair, equal division is the best way to start our negotiations. Looking forward to your response!",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I agree that a swift resolution is best, I think a 60/40 split better reflects the risk I'm taking with inflation. This way I still come out slightly ahead if you accept my next offer, assuming your inflation is similar to mine. What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe we can do better. Given the inflation costs—I’d lose 10% of my value each round—it’s crucial we reach an agreement quickly. I think I can craft a proposal in the next round that improves my position a bit compared to receiving an effective $3600 in today's value. Let's take a chance and continue negotiating.",Alice,2,reject
4100.0,5900.0,"Hi Bob, I understand that the longer we wait, the more inflation erodes our gains—I'm now facing a 20% reduction, and while I’m not completely sure how inflation affects you, it's in both our interests to settle soon. To that end, I propose a division of $10000 with $4100 for me and $5900 for you. This 41/59 split is designed to give you a modest edge while still leaving me with a fair share, and it should be preferable to further delays. Let’s wrap this up quickly before the numbers drop further!",Alice,3,
