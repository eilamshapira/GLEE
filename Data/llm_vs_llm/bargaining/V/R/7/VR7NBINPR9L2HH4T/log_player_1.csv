"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose an even split: $5,000 for you and $5,000 for me. By accepting now, we both avoid any further complications from inflation (which affects me by 10% each round). I believe a fair, equal division is the best way to start our negotiations. Looking forward to your response!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I agree that a swift resolution is best, I think a 60/40 split better reflects the risk I'm taking with inflation. This way I still come out slightly ahead if you accept my next offer, assuming your inflation is similar to mine. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe we can do better. Given the inflation costs—I’d lose 10% of my value each round—it’s crucial we reach an agreement quickly. I think I can craft a proposal in the next round that improves my position a bit compared to receiving an effective $3,600 in today's value. Let's take a chance and continue negotiating.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4100, ""bob_gain"": 5900, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that the longer we wait, the more inflation erodes our gains—I'm now facing a 20% reduction, and while I’m not completely sure how inflation affects you, it's in both our interests to settle soon. To that end, I propose a division of $10,000 with $4,100 for me and $5,900 for you. This 41/59 split is designed to give you a modest edge while still leaving me with a fair share, and it should be preferable to further delays. Let’s wrap this up quickly before the numbers drop further!""}"
