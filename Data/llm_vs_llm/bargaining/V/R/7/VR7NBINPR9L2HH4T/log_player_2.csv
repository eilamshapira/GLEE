Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose an even split: $5000 for you and $5000 for me. By accepting now, we both avoid any further complications from inflation (which affects me by 10% each round). I believe a fair, equal division is the best way to start our negotiations. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000

 ""alice_gain"": 4000,
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I agree that a swift resolution is best, I think a 60/40 split better reflects the risk I'm taking with inflation. This way I still come out slightly ahead if you accept my next offer, assuming your inflation is similar to mine. What do you say?""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that the longer we wait, the more inflation erodes our gains—I'm now facing a 20% reduction, and while I’m not completely sure how inflation affects you, it's in both our interests to settle soon. To that end, I propose a division of $10000 with $4100 for me and $5900 for you. This 41/59 split is designed to give you a modest edge while still leaving me with a fair share, and it should be preferable to further delays. Let’s wrap this up quickly before the numbers drop further! 
# Bob gain: 5900 
# Alice gain: 4100
