Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Since we both face inflation with each round, it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement quickly. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my position as the first mover.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe a 55-45 split is fairer, given the potential for future inflation. It's a good deal for both of us and avoids unnecessary delays. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
