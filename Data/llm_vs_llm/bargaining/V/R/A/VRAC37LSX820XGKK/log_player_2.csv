"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Since we both face inflation with each round, it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement quickly. This is a fair offer that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my position as the first mover. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
