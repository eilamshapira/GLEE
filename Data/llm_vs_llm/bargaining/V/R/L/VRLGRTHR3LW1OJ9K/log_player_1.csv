"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $1,000,000. Since the money loses 10% of its value for me with each passing round, I should consider that in my proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a fair offer that gives both of us a substantial amount, while accounting for the fact that I face a disadvantage with the 10% inflation penalty in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that Bob is starting with extremely aggressive offers. I need to take a more strategic approach while keeping in mind that the money loses 10% value for me each round.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm slightly increasing my request to 60/40 to account for both the inflation penalty I face and to signal that Bob's extreme offer wasn't productive. This is still a reasonable split that leaves Bob with a substantial amount, and I hope we can reach a fair agreement without wasting more rounds, which would harm my position further due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see Bob is continuing with extremely unfair offers, suggesting he may be trying to use the inflation penalty against me. I need to adapt my strategy.

{""alice_gain"": 680000, 
""bob_gain"": 320000}

I'm offering Bob 32% of the total amount. With each passing round, my position weakens due to inflation, so I'm adjusting my offer accordingly. This is still a reasonable division that gives Bob a significant portion while accounting for my disadvantage in this negotiation. I hope Bob will recognize that constructive cooperation would benefit us both rather than continuing with extreme offers that only waste rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that Bob is consistently making the same minimal offer, apparently trying to force me into a very disadvantageous position as inflation reduces the value of my share. I need to be strategic about this.

{""alice_gain"": 750000, 
""bob_gain"": 250000}

Given that we're now in round 7 and the money has already lost nearly 41% of its value for me, I'm adjusting my offer to account for this significant inflation penalty. This 75/25 split helps offset some of my disadvantage while still giving Bob a quarter million dollars. Bob should understand that cooperation now is better than continuing this pattern, as further delays will only lead to both of us potentially getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement within the 12-round limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 900000 
# Bob gain: 100000
