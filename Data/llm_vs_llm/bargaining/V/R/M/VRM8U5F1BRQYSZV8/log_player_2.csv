"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 90/10 split. Take it or leave it, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $1000 for me, $9000 for Alice
2. If I reject, next round:
   - The money will be worth 20% less for me
   - 10% less for Alice
   - But I get to make the offer

This is a very unfair initial offer from Alice. Since I can make a counter-offer in the next round, and Alice's money will also depreciate (though less than mine), I should reject this and propose a more balanced split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

The money is now worth:
- For me: 80% of original value
- For Alice: 90% of original value

I should propose a more equitable split, but accounting for the depreciation:

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair. With the current depreciation, this split gives us roughly equal real value. If you reject, we'll both lose more value next round.""}

This offer makes sense because:
1. A 60/40 split is more reasonable than Alice's initial 90/10
2. Given the depreciation, $6000 for me at 80% value ≈ $4800 real value
3. $4000 for Alice at 90% value ≈ $3600 real value
4. If Alice rejects, both of us will lose more value in the next round
5. It's firm but fair, and highlights the mutual benefit of accepting now"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: My previous offer was generous, Bob. This is my final offer. Take it or you'll regret it. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $3500 for me, $6500 for Alice
2. With depreciation:
   - My $3500 is worth $2240 (64% of original value)
   - Alice's $6500 is worth $5265 (81% of original value)
3. If I reject:
   - Next round money will depreciate even more (20% more for me, 10% more for Alice)
   - My next offer would be worth significantly less for both of us

While this isn't an ideal split, considering:
- The increasing depreciation rate
- That my counter-offer would be worth even less
- That Alice has shown she's willing to play hardball
- That this offer is significantly better than her first one

I should accept this offer now before the money loses more value.
