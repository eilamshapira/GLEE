"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hey Bob, let's start with a fair division. I take $60 and you take $40. We both benefit more by agreeing early given the inflation impact, especially on your share.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split is the fairest starting point. We both face inflation, and while mine is higher, that doesn't justify an uneven initial split. This way we both get equal amounts and can avoid further rounds of negotiation where we both lose value. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
