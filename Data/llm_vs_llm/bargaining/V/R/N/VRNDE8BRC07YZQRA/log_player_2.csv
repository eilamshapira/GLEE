"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's start with a fair division. I take $60 and you take $40. We both benefit more by agreeing early given the inflation impact, especially on your share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice has proposed that she gets $60 and I get $40.

Since the inflation rate for my money is 20% per round versus 5% for Alice, there's pressure on me to accept earlier rather than later. If I reject and we move to round 2, my $40 would be worth only $32 (80% of $40), while Alice's $60 would be worth $57 (95% of $60).

However, I believe a 50-50 split would be more fair as a starting point. Alice's current offer gives her a significant advantage.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a counter-offer that considers both the inflation rates and fairness.

Since Alice's money depreciates at only 5% per round while mine depreciates at 20% per round, there's more pressure on me to reach an agreement quickly. However, this doesn't mean I should accept an unfair division.

I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging our different inflation rates.
