5500.0,4500.0,Let's start with a fair split considering the inflation rates. This offer gives you a bit more relative value.,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Given our different inflation rates (your 20% vs my 5%), this split is actually fair in terms of preserved value. If we continue negotiating, your share will lose value much faster than mine, so this is a good deal for both of us.",Bob,2,

5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split it evenly this time. Considering the inflation, this is still a good deal for you.",Alice,3,

4000.0,6000.0,"Let's be practical - at this point, your $4000 today is worth more than $5000 would be in the next round due to your 20% inflation rate. This is the best way for both of us to preserve value. If we continue, we both lose more.",Bob,4,
