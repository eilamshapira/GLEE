"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split considering the inflation rates. This offer gives you a bit more relative value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4,500 in round 1, which is its full value for me.
2. Alice takes $5,500, also at full value for her.
3. If I reject, we move to round 2 where:
   - My money will be worth 95% of original value
   - Her money will be worth 80% of original value
4. The decline in value is much steeper for her (20% vs my 5%)
5. This gives me negotiating leverage in later rounds.

While 45/55 split isn't terrible, given the significant difference in our inflation rates, I believe I can get a better deal by negotiating. Alice has more urgency to make a deal due to her higher inflation rate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

1. Given Alice's 20% per round inflation compared to my 5%, she has more pressure to agree soon
2. However, I shouldn't be too aggressive as we need to reach an agreement within 12 rounds
3. I'll propose a more favorable split for me, but with a reasonable explanation

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Given our different inflation rates (your 20% vs my 5%), this split is actually fair in terms of preserved value. If we continue negotiating, your share will lose value much faster than mine, so this is a good deal for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. Considering the inflation, this is still a good deal for you. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. The $5,000 I would receive is worth $4,512.50 (90.25% of original value due to 9.75% inflation)
2. Alice's $5,000 is worth only $3,200 (64% of original value due to 36% inflation)
3. This shows Alice is feeling the pressure of her higher inflation rate
4. However, given the steep difference in our inflation rates, I can still push for a better deal
5. The total money is losing more value for Alice with each round, strengthening my negotiating position

While a 50/50 split might seem fair on the surface, considering the inflation rates and the fact that Alice's money is losing value much faster, I believe I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the current situation:

1. My inflation loss is now around 15% (5% per round)
2. Alice's inflation loss is now around 60% (20% per round)
3. The difference in our inflation rates is becoming more pronounced
4. However, I should make an offer that Alice is likely to accept to avoid losing too much value ourselves

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be practical - at this point, your $4000 today is worth more than $5000 would be in the next round due to your 20% inflation rate. This is the best way for both of us to preserve value. If we continue, we both lose more.""}"
