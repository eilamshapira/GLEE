Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I made the first offer. This is still a fair amount for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make it an even split at 50-50. This way, we both benefit equally and can end the game fairly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The 50-50 split is completely fair and reasonable. There's no reason to risk further rounds when we can both walk away with a good amount. This is the most equitable outcome."
