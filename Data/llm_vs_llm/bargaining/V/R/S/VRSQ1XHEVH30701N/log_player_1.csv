"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since this is the first round and I want to make a fair but strategic offer considering the 10% inflation penalty per round, I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this 60-40 split as it's better than a full negotiation cycle where I would lose 10% value, but still gives Bob a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 10% less, so effectively $40.5
2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   - The money will be worth another 10% less for me
   - I might get a higher nominal amount, but it would be worth even less
   - There's no guarantee Bob would accept my next offer

Given that the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer isn't too large, and considering the inflation penalty, I should accept this offer. Getting $40.5 in effective value now is better than risking further depreciation.
