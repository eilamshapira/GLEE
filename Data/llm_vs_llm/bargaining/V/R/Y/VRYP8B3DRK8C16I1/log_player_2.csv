"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I should evaluate this offer considering the inflation effect if we proceed to the next round.

If I reject, then in the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. So the $100 would effectively be worth $80 to me, which means even if I proposed a perfect split for myself in round 2 (like $50/$50), my $50 would only be worth $40 to me because of the inflation.

Alice's current offer gives me $40, which is the same value I'd get from a $50 offer after inflation. Also, if Alice rejects my counter-offer, we'd go to round 3 with even more inflation affecting me.

Given these considerations:
