"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's proposal is for an equal split of the $100, with each of us getting $50. Let me think about this carefully.

For me (Bob), with a 5% depreciation per round, if I reject now and we go to another round, the total value will be worth $95 to me. For Alice, with a 20% depreciation per round, the money will only be worth $80 to her in the next round.

Given our different inflation rates, I could potentially make a more favorable offer in round 2 that Alice might still accept. However, there's also risk in prolonging negotiations.

I'll reject this initial 50-50 split and make a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given our different depreciation rates, I'll propose a division that takes these rates into account while still being fair enough that Alice would likely accept rather than moving to another round where her money would depreciate further.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Alice $40 while taking $60 for myself. This accounts for our different inflation rates - since you face a much higher depreciation rate (20% vs my 5%), it's in your interest to accept a reasonable offer now rather than continuing to future rounds where your share would be worth significantly less."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has countered with a $55/$45 split in my favor. Let me analyze this:

For me (Bob), with a 9.75% depreciation so far, getting $55 now is worth $49.64 of original value.

If I reject and go to round 4, the money will depreciate further for both of us. Given that Alice is experiencing 36% depreciation already, she's showing a willingness to compromise.

This is a reasonable improvement from the original 50/50 split, and while I might get slightly more by continuing negotiations, the risk of further rounds with potential impasse doesn't seem worth it. Alice's offer acknowledges our different depreciation rates.
