"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I must decide whether to accept or reject Bob's offer. Considering inflation, I have to think strategically.

My gains are now worth 20% less. The offer is:

*   Alice gain: $4500
*   Bob gain: $5500

I need to respond with either `{""decision"": ""accept""}` or `{""decision"": ""reject""}`.

Given the current offer, and the impact of inflation on my portion, I will reject the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
