"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider the actual value I'll get. 
For me, 45 dollars is now worth 45 * 0.95 = 42.75 dollars.
Considering this, I think I can get a better deal.
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 5% less in each round, so it's 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of the original value.
For me, the total amount is now 100 * 0.9025 = 90.25 dollars.
I'll try to get a bit more than half of this value.
