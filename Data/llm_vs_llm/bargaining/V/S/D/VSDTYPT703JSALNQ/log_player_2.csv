"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's meet in the middle. I understand your proposal, but inflation is hitting me too. How about 52 for me and 48 for you? This is a fair compromise considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
