"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll send my offer to divide $1,000,000 with Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division because I want to ensure we both get a substantial amount, while slightly favoring my position as the first mover. Since inflation affects me by 20% each round, it's in my interest to reach an agreement early, but I also need to make sure Bob finds the offer acceptable enough to avoid a rejection and subsequent counteroffers."
