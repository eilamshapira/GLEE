357143.0,642857.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for splitting the $1000000: I would receive $357143 and you would receive $642857. Given that in future rounds the values decrease (20% for me and 10% for you per round), I believe this division is efficient for both of us. Accepting now prevents further loss in valueâ€”let's close this deal quickly.",Alice,1,
