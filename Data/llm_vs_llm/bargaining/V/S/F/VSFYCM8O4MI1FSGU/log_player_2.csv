"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for splitting the $1000000: I would receive $357143 and you would receive $642857. Given that in future rounds the values decrease (20% for me and 10% for you per round), I believe this division is efficient for both of us. Accepting now prevents further loss in valueâ€”let's close this deal quickly. 
# Bob gain: 642857 
# Alice gain: 357143 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, let's analyze the situation.

In the first round, Alice offers me $642,857 and takes $357,143 for herself. 

If I reject this offer, in the next round, I will make a proposal. The total amount of money will be worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice. 

The money's value to me will decrease by 10% each round, and to Alice by 20%. 

Considering this, I should think about the potential future gains and losses. 

However, given that Alice's initial offer gives me a larger share ($642,857 vs $357,143), and considering the significant decrease in value for both of us in subsequent rounds, it seems like a reasonable starting point.

Given these considerations, my decision is:
