"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I'm ready. Here's my offer in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate. Because of inflation, the money is worth 20% less. My gains in the first round would be worth 80% of their original value.
My equivalent money would be $40 * 0.8 = $32.
Bob's offer this round gives me $40.
