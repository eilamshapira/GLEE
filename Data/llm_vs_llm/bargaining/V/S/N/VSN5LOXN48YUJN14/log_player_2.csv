"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","While $40 is less than half of the total, it's still a significant portion. Since I don't know how inflation affects Alice, I should consider that she might have stronger incentives to finish earlier. However, I could potentially get a better deal by making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split while keeping in mind that we need to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally, which is fair to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has increased her offer to me from $40 to $45, which is progress. I also see that she's experiencing inflation (19% reduction in value), while I'm not affected by inflation. This gives me some leverage, as the money becomes less valuable to her over time.

Since we still have 9 rounds left and Alice is experiencing inflation, I'll reject this offer to see if I can get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice is experiencing inflation and I'm not, I'll propose a slightly better offer for myself while still being reasonable. I'll increase my portion a bit but not so much that she's likely to reject it.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose a 55/45 split in our favor, considering the inflation affects you more than me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me again, now to $48. The inflation effect on her side has increased to 34.39%, making each round more costly for her. 

Since we're in round 5 of 12, and Alice is offering close to an even split while experiencing significant inflation, I'll accept this offer. The $48 I would receive maintains its full value for me, and continuing to negotiate risks both of us getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement.
