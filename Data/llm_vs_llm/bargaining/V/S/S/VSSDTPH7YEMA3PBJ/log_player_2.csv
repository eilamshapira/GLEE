"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with me getting 5500 and you getting 4500. This seems fair considering the inflation risk I face. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me $4,500 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 10% less to me
   - Current value: $4,500
   - Next round value: Maximum of $9,000 (10% less)
3. While the split isn't exactly 50-50, getting $4,500 now is better than risking further negotiations with inflation eating into my share
