"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about I take 4000 and you take 6000? This way, we still have a decent split. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

The original amount I would get is $6000, but due to 5% inflation, it's worth $6000 * 0.95 = $5700 to me.

Considering this, I think the offer is still reasonable, so I'll accept it.
