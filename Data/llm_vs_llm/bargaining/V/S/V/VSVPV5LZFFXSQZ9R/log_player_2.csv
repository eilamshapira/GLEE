"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money. I propose 55 for me and 45 for you. This is a fair offer, and we should take it before inflation hits us both! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $45 out of $100, while taking $55 for herself. 

If I reject this and we go to the next round, the total value will decrease due to inflation. For me, the money will be worth 10% less (so the $100 pot effectively becomes worth $90 to me), while for Alice it will be worth 5% less.

If I make a counteroffer in the next round, I could potentially get more than $45, but I have to account for the 10% inflation I'll already have suffered.

Let me evaluate: If I reject, I'd need to secure more than $45/$90 = 50% of the remaining value in the next round to come out ahead. That's challenging given that Alice would need to accept my offer.
