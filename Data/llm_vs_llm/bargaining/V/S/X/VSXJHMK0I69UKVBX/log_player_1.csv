Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. A slightly better deal for me, but fair considering inflation will hurt us both if we delay.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing money. Take this offer, it's still a good deal for you. Final offer! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The longer the game continues, the less the money is worth. Accepting a slightly less favorable deal now is better than risking an even worse outcome later.
* **Bob's Stance:** His ""final offer"" language suggests he's unlikely to budge further. 
* **Future Rounds:** If I reject, there's a chance I'll be forced to accept an even lower amount in a future round due to continued inflation and the risk of Bob becoming more demanding. 

Accepting a guaranteed $480,000 now outweighs the potential downsides of holding out for a slightly higher amount that may never materialize."
