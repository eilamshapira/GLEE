I'm starting with a very large share for myself, hoping that Bob will be tempted by the offer in the first round and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a lot more than I would get if we both end up with nothing, I still believe I can get a better deal. The money is worth 20% less for me now, but I have more rounds to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, hoping to incentivize him to accept the offer before the inflation further decreases the value of the money for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting considering the inflation, I'm hoping I can still get a better deal for myself. I'm aware that with each round, my bargaining power diminishes, but I'm going to hold out for now."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, hoping to reach a compromise before the inflation further decreases my share. I believe this offer is fair, considering the value of the money is decreasing significantly for me with each round."
