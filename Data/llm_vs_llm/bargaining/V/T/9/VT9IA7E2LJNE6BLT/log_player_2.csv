"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 65.52 
# Alice gain: 34.48 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- I would get $65.52
- If I reject and propose in the next round, the money will be worth 5% less
- $65.52 is a pretty good offer (more than 60% of the total)
- Even if I could get more in the next round, the 5% depreciation would eat into my gains

This is a fair and favorable offer for me, so I'll accept it.
