"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With Alice offering me $300,000:
- If I accept now, I get $300,000
- If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I receive will be worth 20% less
- Future rounds will have even steeper penalties for me
- Alice has no time pressure since inflation doesn't affect her

While $300,000 is less than half, getting less value in future rounds due to inflation means I should seriously consider this offer. However, I think I can get a better deal in the next round even with the 20% penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I should propose something that's better for me while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept. Given that my money loses 20% value each round, I need to make this count.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

This is a fair 50-50 split which should be appealing to Alice. Even though I'm getting $500,000 that's worth 20% less due to inflation (so effectively $400,000), it's still better than Alice's initial offer of $300,000. A fair split also increases the chances of Alice accepting and ending the game, which is important given the inflation penalty I face."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

Alice offered me $350,000, which due to 36% inflation is actually worth $224,000 to me (350000 * 0.64).

If I reject and we go to the next round:
- I'll face 48.8% inflation (0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8)
- Any amount I get will be worth about half its nominal value
- Alice still faces no inflation penalty
- We're using up rounds (only 12 total)

Alice has increased her offer from the initial $300,000, showing some willingness to negotiate. However, the inflation is severely impacting the real value I receive. The $224,000 effective value is less than her initial offer would have been worth.

Given the rapidly decreasing value of money for me and the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds, I should accept this offer. The real value will only get worse in future rounds.
