"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game and the inflation effect. Here's my offer for Round 1, formatted as JSON:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

**Explanation of my strategy:**

*   **Initial Aggressiveness:** I'm starting with a relatively aggressive offer (60/40 split) in my favor. This is because:
    *   It's Round 1, and the money is still worth the full amount.
    *   I want to test Bob's willingness to negotiate.
*   **Addressing Inflation:** I'm aware of the 20% inflation per round. This initial offer aims to front-load my potential gains before the value decreases significantly.
*   **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** I'm not demanding an unreasonable split (e.g., 90/10). This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer or at least being willing to engage in further rounds of negotiation.
*   **Unknown Bob's Inflation:** Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm assuming he is rational and will want to secure a significant portion of the money early on as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I've received Bob's offer for Round 2. Let's analyze it:

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice: $450,000, Bob: $550,000
*   **Inflation Impact:** The money I receive is now worth 80% of its original value.
*   **My Actual Gain:** If I accept, my $450,000 is effectively worth $450,000 * 0.8 = $360,000 in Round 1 dollars.

Now, let's consider my options. My goal is to maximize the value of the money I receive, accounting for the decreasing value over time, with the constraint of 12 rounds. If I reject, I have to make an offer in round 3, so, to make this decision, I want to think strategically. Since he is already close to an even split, I will try to push it a little bit further.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again in Round 3. Remember, the money I receive is now worth 60% of its original value (80% * 80%).

Here's my offer, taking inflation into account and trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and increasing the chances of acceptance:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a counter-offer that is more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer, but less aggressive than my initial offer in Round 1.
*   **Inflation Awareness:** If Bob accepts this offer, my $550,000 is effectively worth $550,000 * 0.6 = $330,000 in Round 1 dollars. Bob will receive the full $450,000.
*   **Compromise:** I am trying to meet Bob somewhat closer to the middle in the hopes of getting him to accept.
*   **Time Pressure:** We are already in Round 3, so the risk of not coming to an agreement is increasing. I want to avoid a long drawn-out negotiation where the value of the money keeps decreasing."
