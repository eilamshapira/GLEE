Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While the offer is the same as Round 1, the inflation is starting to hurt. Alice's offer is proportionally worse for me now than it was in the first round. I need to push for a better split soon, but there are still several rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000} 

I am slightly lowering my asking price to show flexibility, but I am still aiming for a larger share of the pie before inflation eats further into the potential gains."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is getting closer to acceptable, but with the inflation working against me, I need to hold out for a bit longer and hope Alice gets more desperate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000}

I'm lowering my demand slightly again. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want a slight advantage while it's still possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting close to a coin toss in terms of the impact of inflation. I need to signal I'm willing to accept a less favorable split soon, or I risk getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000} 

It's time to go for a straight 50/50 split. This is fair and hopefully prevents us both from walking away with nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's painful to accept less than a 50/50 split, but the inflation is eating into my potential gains with each passing round. Accepting this offer is better than risking a worse deal or even walking away with nothing."
