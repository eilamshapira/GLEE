"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With a 50-50 split, I would get $500,000. However, if I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. So if I wait one round, even if I get a better deal, the maximum value would be $900,000 but worth only $810,000 to me due to inflation.

The current offer gives me a fair split without any inflation penalty. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of continued rounds and inflation eating into my gains makes this a reasonable offer.
