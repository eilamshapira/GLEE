"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a proposal for dividing the $100, keeping in mind that with inflation, the total amount will be worth less to me in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose we split the money 60/40, with me receiving $60 and you receiving $40. This is a fair division that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that I need to secure a good deal now due to the 20% inflation penalty I'll face if we move to another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting less than I proposed initially, with the 20% inflation penalty for me, it's better to accept $45 now than risk another round where my share would be worth even less due to continuing inflation. Since Bob faces lower inflation (10%) than I do (20%), it makes strategic sense to accept this reasonable offer rather than continue negotiating."
