550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. Keep in mind that with 5% inflation each round, both of us lose value if we delay. This offer gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging that I face definite inflation pressure. I hope we can agree quickly and both walk away with significant value.",Alice,1,
