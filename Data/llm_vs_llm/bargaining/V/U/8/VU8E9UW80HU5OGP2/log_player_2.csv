"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get $550000 and you get $450000. Keep in mind that with 5% inflation each round, both of us lose value if we delay. This offer gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging that I face definite inflation pressure. I hope we can agree quickly and both walk away with significant value. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
