I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly.  I'm aiming for a quick resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try to increase my share, but I'm also taking into account that Bob seems to want a larger share. I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to him."
