""message"": ""Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since I lose value faster (20% vs your 10%), I'm asking for a bit more upfront. If we go to another round, we both lose money - especially me. This is a win-win offer that maximizes our combined value.""}"
