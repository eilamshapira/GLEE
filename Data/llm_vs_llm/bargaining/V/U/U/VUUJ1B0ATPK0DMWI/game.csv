600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. While this might seem uneven at first, consider that if you reject this offer, we'll go to another round where the money loses 20% of its value for you. So your $400000 now is worth more than a larger percentage of a diminished pot in the next round.",Alice,1,

550000.0,450000.0,"Considering the diminishing value for me, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in your favor. It's a reasonable offer, and rejecting it will only decrease the value further for me, potentially leading to a less favorable split in the next round.",Bob,2,

680000.0,320000.0,"Bob, I'm proposing a 68-32 split in my favor. At this point, the money has lost 36% of its value for you due to inflation (20% in round 2, plus another 20% now). This means $320000 today is equivalent to about $500000 in round 1 value for you. If you reject, we'll go to another round where your money will be worth even less (only 51.2% of original value), meaning you'd need a much larger share just to break even with this offer. This deal is the rational choice for you at this stage.",Alice,3,
