"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for the inflation factor affecting Bob's valuation.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. While this might seem uneven at first, consider that if you reject this offer, we'll go to another round where the money loses 20% of its value for you. So your $400,000 now is worth more than a larger percentage of a diminished pot in the next round.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the diminishing value for me, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in your favor. It's a reasonable offer, and rejecting it will only decrease the value further for me, potentially leading to a less favorable split in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Bob's offer compared to what I could potentially get in the next round.

Bob is offering me $550,000, which is less than my initial proposal of $600,000. If I reject and we go to round 3, the money will be worth another 20% less to Bob (now worth 64% of the original value to him). This gives me more leverage in the next round.

In round 3, I could potentially propose a more favorable split for myself, perhaps 65-35 or 70-30, which would give me $650,000-$700,000.

Since I don't face any inflation penalty, I'm better off rejecting this offer and making a more aggressive proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll leverage the increasing inflation pressure on Bob to propose a more favorable split for myself.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 680000,
  ""bob_gain"": 320000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I'm proposing a 68-32 split in my favor. At this point, the money has lost 36% of its value for you due to inflation (20% in round 2, plus another 20% now). This means $320,000 today is equivalent to about $500,000 in round 1 value for you. If you reject, we'll go to another round where your money will be worth even less (only 51.2% of original value), meaning you'd need a much larger share just to break even with this offer. This deal is the rational choice for you at this stage.""
