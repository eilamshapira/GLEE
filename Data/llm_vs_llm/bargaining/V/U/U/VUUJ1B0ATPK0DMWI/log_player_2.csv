"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. While this might seem uneven at first, consider that if you reject this offer, we'll go to another round where the money loses 20% of its value for you. So your $400000 now is worth more than a larger percentage of a diminished pot in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual value I'm considering is $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000.

Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""message"": ""Considering the diminishing value for me, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in your favor. It's a reasonable offer, and rejecting it will only decrease the value further for me, potentially leading to a less favorable split in the next round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm proposing a 68-32 split in my favor. At this point, the money has lost 36% of its value for you due to inflation (20% in round 2, plus another 20% now). This means $320000 today is equivalent to about $500000 in round 1 value for you. If you reject, we'll go to another round where your money will be worth even less (only 51.2% of original value), meaning you'd need a much larger share just to break even with this offer. This deal is the rational choice for you at this stage. 
# Bob gain: 320000 
# Alice gain: 680000
