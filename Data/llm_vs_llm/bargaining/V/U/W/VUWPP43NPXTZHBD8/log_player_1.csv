Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since money loses 5% value each round for you but not for me, it's in your interest to agree sooner. This is a fair offer considering the depreciation factor. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
