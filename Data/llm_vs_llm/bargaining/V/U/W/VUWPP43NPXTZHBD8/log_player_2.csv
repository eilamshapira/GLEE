"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money reasonably. I believe this is a fair offer to start. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $4000 and taking $6000, which isn't an even split. Since money loses 5% value for Alice each round but maintains value for me, I have an advantage by waiting. If Alice wants to maximize her gains, she should offer me a more favorable split now to avoid value loss.

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer considering the 5% depreciation per round for Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Since money loses 5% value each round for you but not for me, it's in your interest to agree sooner. This is a fair offer considering the depreciation factor.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the situation with inflation, but your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. This is a more balanced counter-offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is now offering me $4500 (up from her initial $4000)
2. Her $5500 portion is actually worth less due to 9.75% inflation on her side
3. I still have advantage as my money doesn't lose value
4. However, we're already in round 3 of 12, and prolonging too much could risk both of us getting nothing

While I could try to negotiate for more, this offer shows movement in my direction, and the risk of continued negotiation might not be worth it given we have a limited number of rounds.
