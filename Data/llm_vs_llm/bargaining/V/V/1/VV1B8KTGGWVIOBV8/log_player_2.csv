"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject now, the money will be worth 20% less for me in the next round, and it continues to decrease with each round. Let me think...

If I reject and offer in the next round, I might ask for more, but Alice could reject, and we'd both lose value due to inflation. Alice's current offer gives me $40, which is a fair portion considering I lose 20% value each round.
