Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Round 2 Proposal: I know that time (and my money) is losing value quickly, so I'd like to settle now. I'm offering 35 for me and 65 for you â€“ this gives you a better share than before and ensures we conclude before my dollars devalue further. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
