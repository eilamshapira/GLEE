"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your opening offer, but I believe a 50-50 split would be more fair for both of us. This way, we both walk away with half a million dollars, which is a significant sum. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): A 50-50 split is fair and reasonable. While I tried to get a better deal in my first offer, getting $500,000 is still an excellent outcome. If I reject this, Bob might come back with a worse offer in the next round, and we could end up in a back-and-forth that leaves both of us worse off. Better to accept this fair split and end the game positively."
