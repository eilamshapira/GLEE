"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor as I'm making the first move and taking initiative in starting our negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer strategically. She's offering me $400,000 of the $1,000,000, which is a 40% share. While this isn't an equal split, it's also not an extremely unfair offer. However, by rejecting this offer, I'll get to make a counter-proposal in the next round, which could potentially lead to a better outcome for me.

Given that I'll have the proposal power in the next round and that 40% is somewhat below what would be considered a fair split (50-50), I'll reject this offer.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging Alice's initiative in the first round.
