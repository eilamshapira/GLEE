"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest this split because it's close to equal but gives me a small advantage as the first mover. It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting rather than letting inflation reduce the total value in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 5% inflation, $45 now is worth $42.75 in Round 1 terms. If I reject and we go to Round 3, there will be another 5% inflation, further reducing the value.

While I could try to negotiate for more in the next round, the inflation penalty makes this risky. Bob's offer is actually quite reasonable - it's the mirror image of what I proposed, and I'm getting almost as much real value as I would have given Bob in my original proposal.
