"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself since I'm making the first offer, but keep it reasonable to increase chances of acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose taking $55 for myself and giving $45 to Bob. This is a fair split that acknowledges my first-mover position while still offering Bob a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept, I'll get $50, but with 5% inflation, it's worth $47.50 to me
- If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer, but the money will be worth even less (10% less than original)
- Bob's offering an equal split, which is fair, and waiting another round will definitely reduce the value further

Given that inflation will continue to eat into the value and that this is a reasonable offer, I should accept.
