"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly at 5000 each. This is fair considering the inflation impact on both of us, and it's a good midpoint to end the game. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
