"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself since I'm making the first offer, but keep it reasonable to increase chances of acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and you get $45 - a fair division that acknowledges my first-mover position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 5% inflation, if I accept Bob's offer of $45, it's actually worth $42.75 to me (45 * 0.95).

If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I receive will be worth 10% less due to compounding inflation. This means I'd need to secure a significantly higher amount to make up for the loss in value.

Given this, and considering that Bob's current offer is fairly reasonable, I should accept now rather than risk further devaluation.
