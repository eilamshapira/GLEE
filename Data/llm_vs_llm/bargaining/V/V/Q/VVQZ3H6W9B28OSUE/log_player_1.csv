"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'm taking a bigger risk with inflation, so I deserve a larger share. Accept this offer to ensure you get something. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
