Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I think this split would be more equitable at this stage. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While not perfectly equal, accepting this offer ensures I get a reasonable amount, especially with the knowledge that Alice is experiencing significant inflation. If I reject this offer and make my own in round 4,  there's a risk Alice might find it unacceptable due to the decreased value on her end, leading to a worse outcome for me."
