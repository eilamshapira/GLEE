45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice,  I think a more even split is fairer.  I'm offering you $45, which is still a good deal considering the discount each round.  Let's be reasonable and settle this now.",Bob,2,

38.0,62.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid further losses from inflation, I propose we settle now. With the current discount factors, you’d receive an effective payoff of 62 × 0.80 = 49.6, which is comparable to what you’d expect if we delayed further. I believe this is a fair trade-off given the circumstances. Let’s agree and finalize the deal.",Alice,3,
