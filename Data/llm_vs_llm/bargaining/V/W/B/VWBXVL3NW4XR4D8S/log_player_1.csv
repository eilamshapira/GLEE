"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  I think a more even split is fairer.  I'm offering you $45, which is still a good deal considering the discount each round.  Let's be reasonable and settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 38,
  ""bob_gain"": 62,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid further losses from inflation, I propose we settle now. With the current discount factors, you’d receive an effective payoff of 62 × 0.80 = 49.6, which is comparable to what you’d expect if we delayed further. I believe this is a fair trade-off given the circumstances. Let’s agree and finalize the deal.""
