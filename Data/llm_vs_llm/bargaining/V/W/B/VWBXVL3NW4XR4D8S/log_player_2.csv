"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle now: I get $65 and you get $35. With the discount penalty looming each round, accepting today ensures you receive a solid amount without further loss. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I think a more even split is fairer.  I'm offering you $45, which is still a good deal considering the discount each round.  Let's be reasonable and settle this now.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid further losses from inflation, I propose we settle now. With the current discount factors, you’d receive an effective payoff of 62 × 0.80 = 49.6, which is comparable to what you’d expect if we delayed further. I believe this is a fair trade-off given the circumstances. Let’s agree and finalize the deal. 
# Bob gain: 62 
# Alice gain: 38 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
