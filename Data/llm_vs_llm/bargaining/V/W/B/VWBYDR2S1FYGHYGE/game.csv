6000.0,4000.0,"Let's be fair, Bob. This offer gives us both a good deal.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split. If you reject, in the next round the total will be worth 10% less to you (only $9000 in value), meaning even a 50-50 split would only be worth $4500 to you. My current offer gives you $4500 now, which is equivalent to getting 50% in the next round due to your inflation penalty. This is fair given the circumstances.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, it's my turn to propose, and I'm feeling generous. This is the same split you offered, but in reverse. It accounts for the inflation, and gives me a slight advantage for proposing.  Let's close this out.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, with each round, the money loses 10% value for you but stays the same for me. If you reject this offer, in round 5 the $10000 will only be worth $7290 to you (a 27% reduction from the original value). Even if you got 60% in round 5, that would only be worth $4374 to you due to inflation. My current offer of $4000 is almost equivalent to that best case. The logical choice is to accept now rather than lose more value.",Bob,4,

5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, let's stop wasting time.  The value is getting eroded with each round.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this fairly.",Alice,5,
