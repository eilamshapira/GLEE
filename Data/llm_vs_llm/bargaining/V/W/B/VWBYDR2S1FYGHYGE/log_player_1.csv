Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a more balanced split. If you reject, in the next round the total will be worth 10% less to you (only $9000 in value), meaning even a 50-50 split would only be worth $4500 to you. My current offer gives you $4500 now, which is equivalent to getting 50% in the next round due to your inflation penalty. This is fair given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, it's my turn to propose, and I'm feeling generous. This is the same split you offered, but in reverse. It accounts for the inflation, and gives me a slight advantage for proposing.  Let's close this out.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with each round, the money loses 10% value for you but stays the same for me. If you reject this offer, in round 5 the $10000 will only be worth $7290 to you (a 27% reduction from the original value). Even if you got 60% in round 5, that would only be worth $4374 to you due to inflation. My current offer of $4000 is almost equivalent to that best case. The logical choice is to accept now rather than lose more value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
