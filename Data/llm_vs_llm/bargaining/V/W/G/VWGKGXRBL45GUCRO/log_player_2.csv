"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the inflation risk. This offer gives you a substantial amount while ensuring I'm also protected from the devaluing money. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Current offer: I get $4,500, Alice gets $5,500
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But the money will be worth 5% less to me
   * $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500 total value for me in next round

While the split isn't perfectly equal (45/55), accepting now guarantees me $4,500. If I reject, I'd need to get significantly more than $4,500 in the next round to make up for the 5% inflation loss. Additionally, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further inflation losses.

Given these factors, this is actually a reasonable offer considering the inflation risk.
