"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair split considering both our interests. Let's finalize this deal! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully considering the 20% inflation that affects me with each passing round.

Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60. While this isn't an even split, rejecting would mean making a counter-offer next round when the money is worth 20% less to me. If I reject, the $100 would effectively be worth only $80 to me in the next round.

If I were to counter with a 50/50 split next round, I'd get $50 but it would be worth only $40 to me due to inflation. This is the same value as accepting $40 now. Any delay risks further value loss for me.
