"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair. It's still a good deal for you, and we can avoid further negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 10% inflation, the actual values would be:
Alice gain: 4500 * 0.9 = 4050
Bob gain: 5500 * 0.9 = 4950

I think I can get a better deal. My response is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Due to the 10% inflation in each round, the money is now worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of its original value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 52/48 is a fair split considering the decreasing value""} 

Note: These values are based on the original $10,000, but the actual value will be 0.81 times these amounts due to inflation."
