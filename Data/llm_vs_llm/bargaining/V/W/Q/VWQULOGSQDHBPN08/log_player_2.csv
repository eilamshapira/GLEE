"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual value I'm considering is $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000. 

To make a fair offer, I'll split this value roughly in half. 

{""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""alice_gain"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on me, the actual value of the money I would gain is $1,000,000 * 0.64 = $640,000 (since it's worth 36% less). 

Alice's offer of $100,000 would be $100,000 * 0.64 = $64,000 in real value to me.

I think I can do better than that.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 36% less for me after 3 rounds (considering the inflation), and now it's worth even less, the actual value I'm considering is $1,000,000 * 0.64 * 0.8 = $512,000. 

To make a fair offer, I'll split this value roughly in half, but also considering Alice's lower inflation rate, I'll give her a bit more.
