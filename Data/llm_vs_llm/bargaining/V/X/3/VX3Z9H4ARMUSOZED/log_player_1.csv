"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering inflation impacts me more severely than you (20% vs 10% per round). If we delay, we both lose value, so it's in our mutual interest to agree now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation rates, I'm willing to take a bit more, but still offer you a significant share to avoid further losses. This 55-45 split seems more balanced to me. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
