"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering inflation impacts me more severely than you (20% vs 10% per round). If we delay, we both lose value, so it's in our mutual interest to agree now. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
