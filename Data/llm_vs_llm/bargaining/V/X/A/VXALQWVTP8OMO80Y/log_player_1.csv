"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the 10% inflation you face each round, this offer actually gives you more real value now (4500$) than you'd get from a larger nominal amount in future rounds. Let's make a deal now and both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
