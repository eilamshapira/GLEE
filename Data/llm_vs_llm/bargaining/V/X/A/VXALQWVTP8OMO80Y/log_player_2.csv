"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a fair split, slightly favoring me as I'm facing inflation. This gives us both a good deal to begin with! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice wants 5500$ and offers me 4500$
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. For Alice, the money will be worth 10% less next round
4. That means her 5500$ would only be worth 4950$ to her next round
5. This gives me negotiating leverage, as I could offer her less next round and it might still be worthwhile for her
6. A 4500/5500 split isn't terrible, but I can probably do better given the inflation pressure on Alice's side

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, considering the 10% inflation you face each round, this offer actually gives you more real value now (4500$) than you'd get from a larger nominal amount in future rounds. Let's make a deal now and both benefit.""}

Reasoning:
1. I'm increasing my share to 5500$ since I have the leverage of Alice's inflation pressure
2. 4500$ for Alice now is worth more than 5000$ next round (which would only be worth 4500$ to her)
3. My message emphasizes the time pressure on Alice and presents this as a mutually beneficial solution
4. If she rejects, her negotiating position will be even weaker in the next round
5. The offer is still reasonable enough that she might accept to avoid further value loss"
