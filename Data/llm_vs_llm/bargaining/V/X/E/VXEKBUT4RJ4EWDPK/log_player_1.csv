Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, considering I'm taking the first risk by making the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
