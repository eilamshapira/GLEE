Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""How about we switch it up from your previous offer, Bob? Time is money!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is biting, let's split it down the middle before it's too late! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer to get a bit more, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage seems reasonable. The longer the game goes on, the less valuable the money becomes due to inflation.  A guaranteed 50 now is better than risking a lower amount later."
