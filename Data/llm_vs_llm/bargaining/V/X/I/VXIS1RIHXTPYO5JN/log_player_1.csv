"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer to start the negotiation with Bob. Given that I face a 20% inflation penalty per round, I want to reach an agreement quickly.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even split of the $10,000 - $5,000 for each of us. This is a fair division that respects both our interests equally."
