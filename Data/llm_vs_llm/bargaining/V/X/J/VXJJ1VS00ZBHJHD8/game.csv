357143.0,642857.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for an immediate agreement: I take $357143 and you get $642857. Given that each round reduces the value by 20% for me and 10% for you, this split reflects our respective discount rates and the fact that you’re in a slightly stronger position when waiting. I believe this fair division is in both our best interests – accepting it now avoids further devaluation and delays. Let me know your thoughts!",Alice,1,

250000.0,750000.0,"Alice, considering our different depreciation rates (20% for you vs 10% for me), this offer actually gives you $250000 now rather than a smaller amount in future rounds. If we continue to the next round, your share would be worth 20% less, while mine would only decrease by 10%. This makes accepting now your best option. This is a fair offer given the game dynamics.",Bob,2,

206350.0,793650.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal: I propose that you receive $793650 and I receive $206350. In round 3, each dollar is worth only 0.64 for me and 0.81 for you relative to round 1. If you reject this offer, you’ll become the proposer in round 4 and, given your lower discounting (a 10% drop per round), you could secure an effective value (when converted back to round‑3 terms) of about $642857. That effective value translates into roughly $793650 in nominal dollars in round 3. By accepting now, you’ll get exactly that, while avoiding further devaluation. I believe this is the fair threshold based on our respective discount rates—please let me know if you accept!",Alice,3,
