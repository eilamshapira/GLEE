"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 357143, ""bob_gain"": 642857, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for an immediate agreement: I take $357,143 and you get $642,857. Given that each round reduces the value by 20% for me and 10% for you, this split reflects our respective discount rates and the fact that you’re in a slightly stronger position when waiting. I believe this fair division is in both our best interests – accepting it now avoids further devaluation and delays. Let me know your thoughts!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering our different depreciation rates (20% for you vs 10% for me), this offer actually gives you $250000 now rather than a smaller amount in future rounds. If we continue to the next round, your share would be worth 20% less, while mine would only decrease by 10%. This makes accepting now your best option. This is a fair offer given the game dynamics. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 206350, ""bob_gain"": 793650, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my proposal: I propose that you receive $793,650 and I receive $206,350. In round 3, each dollar is worth only 0.64 for me and 0.81 for you relative to round 1. If you reject this offer, you’ll become the proposer in round 4 and, given your lower discounting (a 10% drop per round), you could secure an effective value (when converted back to round‑3 terms) of about $642,857. That effective value translates into roughly $793,650 in nominal dollars in round 3. By accepting now, you’ll get exactly that, while avoiding further devaluation. I believe this is the fair threshold based on our respective discount rates—please let me know if you accept!""}"
