"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for an immediate agreement: I take $357143 and you get $642857. Given that each round reduces the value by 20% for me and 10% for you, this split reflects our respective discount rates and the fact that you’re in a slightly stronger position when waiting. I believe this fair division is in both our best interests – accepting it now avoids further devaluation and delays. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 642857 
# Alice gain: 357143 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current offer to me (Bob): $642,857
2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   * Money will be worth 10% less for me
   * Money will be worth 20% less for Alice
   * I'll get to make the next proposal

While Alice's offer gives me a good portion (64.3%), I think I can do better by making my own proposal in the next round. Even with the 10% depreciation, I'll have more leverage since Alice's money will depreciate faster (20%).

Maximum value for me now: $642,857
Next round's total value for me: $900,000 (after 10% depreciation)
Next round's total value for Alice: $800,000 (after 20% depreciation)

Given these dynamics, I believe I can propose a more favorable split in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer considering our different depreciation rates:

{""bob_gain"": 750000,
""alice_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""Alice, considering our different depreciation rates (20% for you vs 10% for me), this offer actually gives you $250,000 now rather than a smaller amount in future rounds. If we continue to the next round, your share would be worth 20% less, while mine would only decrease by 10%. This makes accepting now your best option. This is a fair offer given the game dynamics.""}

Rationale:
1. I'm offering a 75/25 split, which is aggressive but justified by the depreciation dynamics
2. If Alice rejects:
   - Her money will depreciate by 20% in the next round
   - My money will only depreciate by 10%
   - $250,000 now is worth more to her than a larger nominal amount in future rounds
3. The message emphasizes the time-pressure on Alice's side to encourage acceptance"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal: I propose that you receive $793650 and I receive $206350. In round 3, each dollar is worth only 0.64 for me and 0.81 for you relative to round 1. If you reject this offer, you’ll become the proposer in round 4 and, given your lower discounting (a 10% drop per round), you could secure an effective value (when converted back to round‑3 terms) of about $642857. That effective value translates into roughly $793650 in nominal dollars in round 3. By accepting now, you’ll get exactly that, while avoiding further devaluation. I believe this is the fair threshold based on our respective discount rates—please let me know if you accept! 
# Bob gain: 793650 
# Alice gain: 206350 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer carefully:

1. Current offer to me: $793,650
   * With 19% depreciation, this is worth approximately $643,000 in round 1 terms

2. If I reject and go to round 4:
   * Money will depreciate another 10% for me (total 29% from round 1)
   * Money will depreciate another 20% for Alice (total 56% from round 1)
   * The effective value of any amount will be significantly less

Alice's analysis is quite accurate. The offered amount ($793,650) with current depreciation is approximately equivalent to the maximum value I could reasonably expect to achieve in the next round, once further depreciation is factored in.

Given that:
1. The offer gives me about 79.4% of the nominal amount
2. Further negotiations would lead to more value loss for both parties
3. The effective value is close to optimal given our respective bargaining positions
