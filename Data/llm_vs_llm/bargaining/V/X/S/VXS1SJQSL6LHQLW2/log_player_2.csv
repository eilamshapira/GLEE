"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I know that:
1. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
2. Alice's money value decreases by 5% each round, while mine stays the same
3. This means in the next round, $50 would only be worth $47.50 to Alice

Given this information, I can likely propose a split in the next round that gives me more while still being acceptable to Alice due to the time pressure she faces.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I know Alice's money loses 5% value each round, I can leverage this. If I offer her slightly less than $50 now, it's still better for her than waiting another round where her share would be worth even less.

In this round, $50 is worth $47.50 to Alice. I'll offer her $48, which is worth $45.60 to her now, but still better than waiting another round where further depreciation would occur. This is a rational choice for her to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48}

I propose that I get $52 and Alice gets $48."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me $52, which is actually the same split I proposed last round
2. For her, the $48 she would receive is now worth only about $43.32 (due to 9.75% inflation)
3. If I reject, we go to round 4, where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Alice's money will depreciate further to 14.75% less
   - This could let me ask for even more

However, $52 is already a good gain for me compared to the initial 50-50 split, and there's always a risk that prolonging the negotiation could lead to both of us getting nothing if we can't agree.
