Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try this again. I'm being slightly less generous this time. Inflation is hitting us both. Consider this a fair offer, or we both risk losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is worse than my previous one, and while inflation is a concern, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I need to signal I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept an unfair split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  This back and forth isn't helping anyone. I'm proposing a fair 50/50 split to end this quickly. Take it before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""}"
