"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer proposes that I receive $45 while she gets $55. While this isn't an even split, I need to consider our relative time pressures. The money doesn't lose value for me over time, but it loses 5% value per round for Alice. This gives me a strategic advantage in later rounds.

Since we're only in round 1 and I don't face inflation pressure, I can afford to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges our different inflation situations while being fair.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose an even 50/50 split. This is the fairest division possible, and it benefits Alice to accept now rather than continuing to later rounds where her share would be worth less due to her 5% inflation rate. A 50/50 split now is better for her than potentially getting the same or less later when it's worth less to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer, now proposing I receive $48 while she gets $52. This is getting closer to an even split. 

However, her inflation penalty is increasing - the money she would receive is already worth 9.75% less than in round 1. If we continue to later rounds, her inflation will keep increasing, which gives me leverage.

Since I don't face any inflation penalty, I can still afford to negotiate for a slightly better deal, especially since we have plenty of rounds remaining.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly improved offer that takes into account Alice's inflation pressure.

{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48}

I'm proposing I receive $52 while Alice gets $48. This is a fair offer considering Alice's 5% per round inflation penalty. If she rejects this and we continue to later rounds, her share will be worth even less to her due to inflation. It's in her best interest to accept this offer now rather than continuing negotiations where her position weakens with each passing round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has now offered a perfect 50/50 split of $50 each. This is a fair division of the money.

Given that:
1. I don't face any inflation penalty
2. Alice is now facing an 18.55% inflation penalty on her money
3. We've already gone through 5 rounds
4. Alice has moved to an even split proposal

This seems like a reasonable place to end our negotiation. A 50/50 split is fair in absolute terms, and continuing further would just decrease the value of Alice's portion due to her inflation penalty.
