Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose 5500 for me and 4500 for you. This is a good starting point, and we can adjust if needed, but let's avoid losing value to inflation by dragging this out. What do you think?""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 50-50 split is fairer, especially considering inflation affects us both. Let's settle on $5000 each and end this quickly. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
