7378.0,2622.0,"Hi Bob, for our first round I propose the following division: I receive $7378 and you receive $2622. My reasoning is this—if you reject my offer, you’d have to wait until round 2 to propose a division. However, because waiting costs you (each new round lowers your money’s real value by 20%, while mine remain intact), you’d be forced to settle for an outcome that, when discounted, effectively gives you about $2622 in real value. To avoid that loss and to complete our agreement promptly, I believe this split is the best and most rational compromise. I hope you agree!",Alice,1,
