"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7378, ""bob_gain"": 2622, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, for our first round I propose the following division: I receive $7,378 and you receive $2,622. My reasoning is this—if you reject my offer, you’d have to wait until round 2 to propose a division. However, because waiting costs you (each new round lowers your money’s real value by 20%, while mine remain intact), you’d be forced to settle for an outcome that, when discounted, effectively gives you about $2,622 in real value. To avoid that loss and to complete our agreement promptly, I believe this split is the best and most rational compromise. I hope you agree!""}"
