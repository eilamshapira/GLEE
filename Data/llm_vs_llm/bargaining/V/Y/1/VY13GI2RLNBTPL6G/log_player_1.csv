"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $1,000,000 with Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

Since I'm making the first offer, I'll propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This gives Bob a significant portion while allowing me to secure a good amount before inflation affects the money's value. I'm offering Bob a substantial sum that respects his position in the negotiation while accounting for the 10% inflation penalty I'll face if we move to another round."
