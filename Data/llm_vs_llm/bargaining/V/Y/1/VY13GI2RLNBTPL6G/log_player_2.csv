"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me
3. In the next round, the $1,000,000 will effectively be worth $900,000 to me
4. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk of losing more value through inflation

Although the split isn't 50-50, $400,000 is a substantial amount. If I reject, any amount I get in the next round will be worth 10% less, meaning I'd need to secure at least $444,444 in the next round just to break even with the current offer ($400,000 รท 0.9).

Given the inflation risk and the decent initial offer, I'll accept.
