Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that considers both our interests, taking into account the 5% inflation penalty Bob faces each round.

""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fair split that gives you $450,000. Since you face 5% inflation each round, accepting now maximizes your value. If we go another round, your $450,000 would only be worth $427,500 to you. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with a great outcome!""}"
