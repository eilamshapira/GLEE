"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, if I reject this offer, I can make my own proposal in the next round. The downside is that due to inflation, the money will be worth 10% less to me if we continue.

With a 10% inflation penalty, if I reject this offer, the $5000 I could get now would be equivalent to $4500 in the next round. Unless I'm very confident I can get significantly more than $5500 in the next round (which Alice might reject), it's probably best to accept this fair split now.
