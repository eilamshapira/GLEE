0.0,100.0,"Hi Bob, here's my offer: I get nothing and you get the whole $100 immediately. If you decline, you'll simply have the power to propose a division next roundâ€”and since waiting doesn't cost you anything while my money is discounted, you'll effectively get $100 anyway. So why delay? Accept this offer and secure the full $100 now.",Alice,1,

10.0,90.0,"Alice, your initial offer was tempting, but let's be reasonable.  My turn now.  I'm proposing I take $90, leaving you with $10. Sure, it's a smaller share, but remember, delaying further will cost you even more. This ensures you get something now, which is better than nothing in the future, right?",Bob,2,
