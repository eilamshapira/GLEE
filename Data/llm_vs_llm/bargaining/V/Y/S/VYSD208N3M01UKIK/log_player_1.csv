"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 100, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my offer: I get nothing and you get the whole $100 immediately. If you decline, you'll simply have the power to propose a division next roundâ€”and since waiting doesn't cost you anything while my money is discounted, you'll effectively get $100 anyway. So why delay? Accept this offer and secure the full $100 now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was tempting, but let's be reasonable.  My turn now.  I'm proposing I take $90, leaving you with $10. Sure, it's a smaller share, but remember, delaying further will cost you even more. This ensures you get something now, which is better than nothing in the future, right? 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'll accept your offer.""}"
