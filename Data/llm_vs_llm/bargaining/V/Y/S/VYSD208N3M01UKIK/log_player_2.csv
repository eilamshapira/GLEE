"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my offer: I get nothing and you get the whole $100 immediately. If you decline, you'll simply have the power to propose a division next roundâ€”and since waiting doesn't cost you anything while my money is discounted, you'll effectively get $100 anyway. So why delay? Accept this offer and secure the full $100 now. 
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a classic game theory scenario with a twist! While it seems Alice is offering me a great deal, I know the value of her share diminishes significantly with each round.  It's highly likely I can propose a more equitable split in the next round that still benefits me greatly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 90,
""alice_gain"": 10,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was tempting, but let's be reasonable.  My turn now.  I'm proposing I take $90, leaving you with $10. Sure, it's a smaller share, but remember, delaying further will cost you even more. This ensures you get something now, which is better than nothing in the future, right?""
