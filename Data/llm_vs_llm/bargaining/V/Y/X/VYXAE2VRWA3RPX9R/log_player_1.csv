"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account that Bob's money loses 10% value each round. If he rejects this offer, his future gains will be worth less to him. I'll offer a reasonable split that should be attractive enough for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. This is a fair offer considering that if Bob rejects it, any money he gets in the next round will be worth 10% less to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob offers me $450,000, which is worth full value to me
2. Bob takes $550,000, which is actually worth $495,000 to him (due to 10% inflation)
3. If I reject, in the next round:
   * I can make a new offer
   * But Bob's value will decrease another 10%
   * This gives me leverage for the next round
4. However, $450,000 is still a significant amount

Since I can make a better offer in the next round where Bob's position will be weaker (due to further 10% inflation), and since this offer gives me less than my initial proposal, I'll reject.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now I'm in a stronger position because Bob's money is worth 20% less to him than in round 1. Any amount he gets will only be worth 80% of its nominal value to him. I can use this to propose a split more favorable to me.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I propose I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000. While this might seem aggressive, for Bob this $300,000 is actually worth only $240,000 due to the 20% inflation he's experiencing. If he rejects this, in the next round his money will be worth even less (30% less than original value), so this offer is still better for him than waiting for another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob offers me $420,000, which is worth full value to me
2. Bob takes $580,000, which is actually worth $422,820 to him (due to 27.1% inflation)
3. If I reject:
   * I can make a new offer next round
   * Bob's value will decrease another 10%
   * My negotiating position gets even stronger
4. $420,000 is less than both my previous offers and Bob's first offer

Given that Bob's position continues to weaken with each round due to inflation, and this offer is lower than previous ones, I'll reject.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now Bob's money is worth 37.1% less to him than in round 1 (compounded inflation from previous rounds plus another 10%). This gives me an even stronger negotiating position. Any amount he receives will only be worth 62.9% of its nominal value to him.

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I propose I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000. While this might seem like a very uneven split, for Bob this $200,000 is actually worth only $125,800 due to the 37.1% inflation he's experiencing. If he rejects this, in the next round his money will be worth even less (47.1% less than original value), making this offer more attractive than waiting for another round. He should rationally accept this offer given his deteriorating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob offers me $380,000, which is worth full value to me
2. Bob takes $620,000, which is actually worth only $366,110 to him (due to 40.95% inflation)
3. If I reject:
   * I can make a new offer next round
   * Bob's value will decrease another 10%
   * My negotiating position continues to strengthen
4. $380,000 is less than all my previous offers and Bob's previous offers

The offer amount keeps decreasing while my negotiating position keeps getting stronger due to Bob's inflation. This offer is clearly worse than previous ones, and Bob's position will be even weaker next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","At this point, Bob's money is worth 50.95% less than in round 1 (compounded inflation from previous rounds plus another 10%). His position has significantly weakened, as any amount he receives will only be worth 49.05% of its nominal value to him.

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. While this is a very asymmetric split, for Bob this $100,000 is actually worth only $49,050 due to the 50.95% inflation he's experiencing. If he rejects this, in the next round his money will be worth even less (about 60.95% less than original value). This should be compelling for Bob to accept because:
1. His position keeps deteriorating rapidly
2. Any future gains will be worth substantially less to him
3. Further negotiations will only reduce the real value he receives"
