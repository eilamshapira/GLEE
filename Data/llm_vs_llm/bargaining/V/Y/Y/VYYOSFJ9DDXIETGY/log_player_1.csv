"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor. Since your money loses value faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round), it's in your best interest to accept early.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I propose a 55-45 split, acknowledging the inflation disparity but aiming for a more balanced outcome. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it gives me slightly less than my initial proposal, it's still a good deal considering:
1. The money is already worth 5% less to me due to inflation
2. If I reject, we risk further rounds where both our gains diminish
3. It's a reasonable and fair split that acknowledges both players' positions"
