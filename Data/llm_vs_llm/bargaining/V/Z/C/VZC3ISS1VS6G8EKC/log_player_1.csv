"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 50/50 split is the fairest approach. This way we both get an equal share. If we keep negotiating, we both lose value due to inflation, so I hope you'll accept this balanced offer. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
