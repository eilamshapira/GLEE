"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take 60, you take 40.  We can always adjust in the next rounds if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 60/40 split in her favor. If I reject, I can make my own proposal next round, but inflation will reduce the value of my share by 5%. Let me evaluate:

If I accept now: I get $40
If I reject and propose a better split next round: The total would be worth 95% of original value to me.

Since this is the first round and I have room to negotiate for a more balanced split, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a 50/50 split is the fairest approach. This way we both get an equal share. If we keep negotiating, we both lose value due to inflation, so I hope you'll accept this balanced offer.""}"
