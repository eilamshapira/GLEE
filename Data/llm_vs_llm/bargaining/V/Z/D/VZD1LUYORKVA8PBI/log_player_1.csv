"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives a slight advantage to me but is still fair enough that Bob might accept it.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose splitting the money where I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a fairly balanced split with just a moderate advantage to me as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:
- Bob is asking for $5,200, giving me $4,800
- This is actually quite a reasonable counteroffer
- While slightly in Bob's favor, it's not extreme
- We still have 10 rounds left, but there's risk in continuing
- The difference from my initial offer is only $700

Given that this is a fairly balanced offer and we want to avoid the risk of getting nothing after 12 rounds, I'll accept this offer.
