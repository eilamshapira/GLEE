"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Considering the rapid inflation for both of us, especially for Bob, I need to make an offer that's appealing but also leaves me with a decent amount. Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning:

*   I'm asking for a larger share, recognizing my potential to make offers in later rounds and the value erosion for both of us.
*   However, I'm giving Bob a significant $4000, which, at this stage, is still a substantial amount considering his inflation rate. Hopefully, this will be enough to entice him to accept the offer now, rather than risk getting far less in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer. He's proposing $4500 for me and $5500 for himself.

Considering the inflation, let's calculate the effective values:

*   **My value:** $4500 * (1 - 0.05) = $4275 (compared to round 1 value).
*   **Bob's value:** $5500 * (1 - 0.20) = $4400 (compared to round 1 value).

While it seems like a decent split on the surface, my value after inflation is significantly lower than my initial proposal. Bob's value after inflation is also reduced, but he is getting more than I am. Given the time constraint (12 rounds) and the continuing inflation, I should accept this.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
