"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice is offering an equal 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I need to consider the inflation effect - with each passing round, the money is worth 20% less to me. If I reject now, the future value of any amount will decrease, even if I could potentially negotiate a higher nominal amount.

In the first round, a 50% share gives me $50 at full value. If I reject and try for more in round 2, even if I get more dollars, their value to me will be reduced by 20%.

Given the inflation penalty and uncertainty about how it affects Alice, accepting this fair split now seems like the rational choice.
