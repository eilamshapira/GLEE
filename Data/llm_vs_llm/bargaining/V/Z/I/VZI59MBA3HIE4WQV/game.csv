5000.0,5000.0,I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both get an equal share and can finish the game immediately without losing value to inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This still leaves you with a substantial amount, and we can avoid further loss to inflation.",Bob,2,

5200.0,4800.0,"Let's be reasonable here. With 10% inflation each round, we're both losing value by continuing. I'm proposing a 52-48 split in my favor since I was willing to do an equal split initially. This is still very fair and we should conclude now before further inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4600.0,5400.0,"Let's settle this quickly. I'm offering a 54-46 split in my favor. We're both losing money to inflation, so it's better to wrap this up now.",Bob,4,
