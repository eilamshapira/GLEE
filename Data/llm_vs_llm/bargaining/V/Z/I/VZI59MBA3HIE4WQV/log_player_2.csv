Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable here. With 10% inflation each round, we're both losing value by continuing. I'm proposing a 52-48 split in my favor since I was willing to do an equal split initially. This is still very fair and we should conclude now before further inflation.
