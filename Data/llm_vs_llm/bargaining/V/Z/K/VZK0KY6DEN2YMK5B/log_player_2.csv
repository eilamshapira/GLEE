"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money equally so we both walk away happy and avoid any inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether accepting Alice's equal split is the best decision given our different inflation penalties.

If I reject, I'll make an offer next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me while only 10% less to Alice. This differential inflation rate puts me at a disadvantage in later rounds.

With an equal split now, I get $500,000 at full value. If I reject and we continue haggling, my negotiating position weakens faster than Alice's.
