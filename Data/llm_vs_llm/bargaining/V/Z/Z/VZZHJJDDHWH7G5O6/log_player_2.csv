"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and both walk away happy! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is suggesting an even split of $5,000 each.

However, I should remember that inflation affects us differently - my money loses value at 10% per round while Alice only loses 5% per round. This means delaying is more costly for me than for Alice.

If I reject now and we go another round, my $5,000 would effectively be worth only $4,500 next round (10% less), while Alice's $5,000 would be worth $4,750 (5% less).

An even split is fair in absolute terms, and given the asymmetric inflation that hurts me more, it makes sense to accept now rather than risk worse offers later.
