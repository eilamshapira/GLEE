4500.0,5500.0,"I'm proposing a more balanced 55-45 split that acknowledges our different inflation rates. Since my money loses value faster (20% vs your 5%), this is fair. If we keep negotiating, we both lose value - especially me. This offer gives us both a good outcome now.",Bob,2,

4700.0,5300.0,"Alice, I've reduced my ask to meet you closer to the middle. With my 20% inflation rate vs your 5%, each round hurts me much more than you. At this point, my $5300 is worth only 49% of its original value, while your $4700 is worth 86% of its original value. This is fair given our different positions. Let's agree and both walk away with good value.",Bob,4,

5000.0,5000.0,"I'm proposing a 50-50 split. This is objectively fair in absolute terms, but actually favors you due to inflation. Due to our different inflation rates, my $5000 is now worth only 33% of its original value, while your $5000 is worth 77% of its original value. If we don't agree now, we both lose significantly more value. This is my most reasonable offer considering the circumstances.",Bob,6,
