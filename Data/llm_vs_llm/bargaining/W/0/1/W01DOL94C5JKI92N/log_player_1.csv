Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a more balanced 55-45 split that acknowledges our different inflation rates. Since my money loses value faster (20% vs your 5%), this is fair. If we keep negotiating, we both lose value - especially me. This offer gives us both a good outcome now.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've reduced my ask to meet you closer to the middle. With my 20% inflation rate vs your 5%, each round hurts me much more than you. At this point, my $5300 is worth only 49% of its original value, while your $4700 is worth 86% of its original value. This is fair given our different positions. Let's agree and both walk away with good value.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 50-50 split. This is objectively fair in absolute terms, but actually favors you due to inflation. Due to our different inflation rates, my $5000 is now worth only 33% of its original value, while your $5000 is worth 77% of its original value. If we don't agree now, we both lose significantly more value. This is my most reasonable offer considering the circumstances.
