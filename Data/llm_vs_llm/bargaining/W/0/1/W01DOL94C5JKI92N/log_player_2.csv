"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, where she would get $6,000 and I would get $4,000. This doesn't seem like a fair split to me, especially considering that I face a higher inflation penalty (20% per round) compared to Alice's 5%.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates, it would be strategic for me to make a counter-offer that accounts for these differences.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a more balanced 55-45 split that acknowledges our different inflation rates. Since my money loses value faster (20% vs your 5%), this is fair. If we keep negotiating, we both lose value - especially me. This offer gives us both a good outcome now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has slightly improved her offer, now proposing that I get $4,200 instead of $4,000. However, due to inflation, the value of my share has already decreased by 36% compared to round 1, while Alice's share has only decreased by 9.75%.

This offer still heavily favors Alice, especially considering the asymmetric inflation rates that affect me much more severely. If we continue negotiating, my position weakens faster than hers due to the different inflation rates.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5300, ""alice_gain"": 4700, ""message"": ""Alice, I've reduced my ask to meet you closer to the middle. With my 20% inflation rate vs your 5%, each round hurts me much more than you. At this point, my $5300 is worth only 49% of its original value, while your $4700 is worth 86% of its original value. This is fair given our different positions. Let's agree and both walk away with good value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right about inflation, but I still need a better split 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer slightly again, now offering me $4,300. However, with the severe inflation impact on my share (59.04% less value than round 1), while Alice's share has only lost 18.55% of its value, this offer still significantly favors her.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates and the fact that we're now 5 rounds in, the relative negotiating power continues to shift in Alice's favor with each passing round.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 50-50 split. This is objectively fair in absolute terms, but actually favors you due to inflation. Due to our different inflation rates, my $5000 is now worth only 33% of its original value, while your $5000 is worth 77% of its original value. If we don't agree now, we both lose significantly more value. This is my most reasonable offer considering the circumstances.""}"
