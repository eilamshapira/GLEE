"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 10% less to me
4. If I get $50 next round, it would only be worth $45 to me due to inflation
5. $40 now is better than $45 worth of inflated money next round, especially since Alice might reject my counter-offer

The offer isn't exactly equal, but it's reasonable enough considering the inflation penalty for waiting.
