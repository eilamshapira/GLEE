"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, as I want to secure a good portion while still making it attractive enough for Bob to accept rather than risk inflation by continuing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this 50-50 split because with the 5% inflation penalty, I would only effectively get $47.50. I believe I can make a better offer in the next round that would still be attractive to Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm reducing my demand compared to my first offer to increase chances of acceptance, considering that inflation is affecting both of us. With the current 10% inflation effect on my gains, I would effectively get $49.50, which is still better than accepting the previous 50-50 split. This offer gives Bob a reasonable amount while protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because with the 14.26% inflation penalty, I would get effectively $38.58. If I reject and we continue, the inflation penalty will grow even larger, making future gains worth less. Given the increasing inflation and the risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement, this is a reasonable compromise."
