"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split. Let's end this quickly and both get a good share! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) of the $1,000,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 10% less to me
   - The next round total value for me would be $900,000
   - Even if I got a better percentage, I might end up with less real value

A 40% share right now ($400,000) is better than risking a lower effective value in the next round. Even if I managed to get 50% in the next round, that would only be $450,000 before inflation, and $405,000 after the 10% inflation - not much better than the current offer.
