"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering if you reject, the money will be worth less for both of us, especially for you with your 20% depreciation rate. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $4,000 for me
2. If I reject:
   * Next round the money will be worth 20% less for me
   * $10,000 Ã— 0.8 = $8,000 effective total for me to work with
   * Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, I'm already at a disadvantage

Alice is right that I have a higher depreciation rate (20% vs her 10%), which puts me in a weaker negotiating position. If I reject, even if I propose a 50-50 split next round, my share would be worth $4,000, which is the same as what I'm being offered now, and Alice might reject that anyway.

Given these circumstances, it's better to accept now rather than risk further depreciation.
