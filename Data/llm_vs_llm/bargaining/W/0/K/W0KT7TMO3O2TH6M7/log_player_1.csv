"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I must consider the impact of inflation on my share. In round 1, I proposed to take 60$, but now it is worth 10% less, or 54$. Bob is offering me 50$ and with no inflation on his side.

Therefore, I reject this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for round 3, considering inflation. In round 1, 60$ was worth 60$. In round 2, 50$ was worth 50$. I have to take more than this to make it worth it to me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze:

*   **My perspective (Alice):** In round 1, I got 60$. Due to inflation, the offer of 40$ is worth 27.1% less, which means it's worth approximately 43.76$.
*   **Bob's perspective:** In round 1, he got 40$. Bob will get 60$ and there is no inflation on his side.

Since my money is worth less than the first round and Bob is getting more, I reject the offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for round 5, keeping inflation in mind. At this point, my share has decreased in value significantly. I need to propose a larger share for myself to compensate for that.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```"
