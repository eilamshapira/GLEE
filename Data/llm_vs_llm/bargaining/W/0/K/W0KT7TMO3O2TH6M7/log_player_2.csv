Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Even though the value of the money is decreasing for Alice, this offer is still not in my best interest. I need to hold out for a better split."

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough decision, but I need to recognize that the value of the money is rapidly declining for Alice. If I reject this offer, there's a good chance she'll offer me even less in the next round, and I could end up with nothing. It's better to secure a smaller gain now than risk getting a much worse deal later."
