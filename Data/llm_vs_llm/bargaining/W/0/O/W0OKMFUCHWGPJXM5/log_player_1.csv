"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm feeling generous today, so take this offer while you still can. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 20% inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, my $350,000 would be worth $280,000 in real value (since 20% of $350,000 is $70,000).

I think I can do better than that. My response is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, and this is the 3rd round, I've already lost 36% of its value (20% in Round 1 + 16% in Round 2, since the 20% loss is compounded). To make up for this loss, I'll make a more favorable offer to myself.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's make a deal before inflation eats away too much of my share.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking, Alice. My offer is generous considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 48.8% inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, my $300,000 would be worth approximately $154,400 in real value (since 48.8% of $300,000 is $145,600, which is subtracted from $300,000).

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I also don't want to risk losing even more value due to inflation. My response is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me, and I've rejected Bob's offer, I'll try to make a more reasonable offer to myself while still being mindful of Bob's perspective.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground before inflation devalues my share even further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Don't be greedy, Alice. Time is running out and this is a very fair offer. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 67.23% inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, my $250,000 would be worth approximately $82,425 in real value (since 67.23% of $250,000 is $167,575, which is subtracted from $250,000, and then the remaining $82,425 is the real value).

This offer seems quite low, but I also don't want to risk losing even more value due to inflation. However, I still think I can get a better deal. My response is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 67.23% less for me, and I've rejected Bob's offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to myself while still being mindful of Bob's perspective.

Here's my offer for Round 7:

""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bigger risk to get a fair share, but this is my final reasonable offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 79.03% inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, my $200,000 would be worth approximately $41,940 in real value (since 79.03% of $200,000 is $158,060, which is subtracted from $200,000).

This offer is extremely low, but I also don't want to risk getting nothing if we can't come to an agreement. With only 4 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure. My response is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 79.03% less for me, and I've rejected Bob's offer, I'll try to make a more desperate offer to myself while still being mindful of Bob's perspective.

Here's my offer for Round 9:

{""alice_gain"": 580000, 
""bob_gain"": 420000,
