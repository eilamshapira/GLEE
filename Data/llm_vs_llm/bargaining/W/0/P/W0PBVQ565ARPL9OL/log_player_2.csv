"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $40 out of the $100, which is less than half. Since this is only the first round, and I'll have a chance to make a counteroffer in round 2, I should consider whether waiting is worthwhile.

If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less to me in the next round, meaning the total value will be $90 for me. However, I can then make my own proposal for a more favorable split.

I think I should reject this initial offer and propose a more balanced split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering that I've already lost 10% of the value and need to make a compelling offer to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm offering an equal split of the money, which is fair to both of us. This gives each of us $50, and while the money is worth slightly less to me now due to the 10% inflation after round 1, an equal division is a principled position that respects both our interests."
