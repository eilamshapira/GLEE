"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $450,000 out of $1,000,000
- That's a 45%-55% split in Alice's favor
- If I reject, the total amount will decrease by 10% to $900,000
- I would need to make a counter-offer next round
- This is a fairly reasonable first offer, not too far from 50-50
- The risk of losing value through inflation outweighs the potential gain from negotiating
