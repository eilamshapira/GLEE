Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer for an equal split, but I believe a 60/40 division is reasonable given the time-bound nature of our negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation issue, I am offering a 45/55 split. This gives you a larger share and still keeps a fair consideration for both of us. I hope this meets our mutual interests. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
