"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a division of $1,000,000 to Bob, keeping in mind the potential for inflation in later rounds. I will start with a proposal that is slightly in my favor, but hopefully acceptable to Bob to avoid the risk of losing money to inflation.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob has rejected my initial offer and has now made a counter-offer. I need to decide whether to accept his offer or risk further inflation in the next round. Bob's offer gives me $475,000. The initial offer was for $550,000, but that was rejected. If I reject this offer, the total pot will be worth $950,000 and I will be making the offer.

Let's consider the current offer versus waiting. Right now, Bob is offering $475,000. If I reject and the total pot decreases to $950,000, I'd likely need to ask for a higher percentage to make up the difference. It seems like the difference between what I originally wanted and what is being offered now isn't worth the risk of further losses.
