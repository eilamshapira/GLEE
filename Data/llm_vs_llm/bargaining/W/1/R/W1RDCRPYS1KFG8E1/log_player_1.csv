"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a fair initial offer while considering that inflation will reduce the value of money in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a reasonable split that gives me a slight advantage but still offers Bob a substantial amount. If Bob rejects this, we'll move to the next round where the total value will be worth less due to 5% inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. Due to 5% inflation, my $5000 would actually be worth $4750 in terms of round 1 value
3. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, we'll face another 5% inflation, making any future gains worth even less
4. My initial offer of $5500 was rejected, suggesting Bob is likely to continue rejecting uneven splits
5. The current offer, even with inflation, is still reasonable and prevents further value loss

{""decision"": ""accept""}

Better to accept this fair offer now than risk further devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds."
