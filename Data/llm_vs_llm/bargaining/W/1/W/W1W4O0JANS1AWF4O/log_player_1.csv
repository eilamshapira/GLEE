"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $10,000 with Bob. Since there's 20% inflation per round for me, I should make a reasonable first offer that Bob would likely accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering an equal split of the money. A fair 50-50 division seems like a good starting point that respects both our interests while acknowledging that delays would hurt my position due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice that Bob wants a larger share, and I now understand that inflation affects Bob too, but at a lower rate (10% per round versus my 20% per round). Since we're now in round 3, each delay is more costly for me than for Bob, but it's still better to reach a fair agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm offering a slightly adjusted split that gives Bob more than an equal division but still preserves a reasonable share for me. This acknowledges our different inflation rates while seeking a compromise that could be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
