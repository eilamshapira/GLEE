"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a fair first offer, considering the 5% inflation penalty per round that affects my gains.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose this split because it's close to 50-50 but slightly in my favor to account for the time pressure I face due to inflation. This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while protecting my interests against potential future rounds where my share would be worth less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because even though it's slightly less favorable than my initial proposal, with the 5% inflation penalty, waiting another round would make any future gains worth even less to me. My $4,800 share is now worth $4,560 due to the first round's inflation, but that's better than risking further depreciation in future rounds. It's a reasonable compromise that gives both parties a substantial portion of the money."
