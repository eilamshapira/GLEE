"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer carefully.

Round 1: Alice offers me $4800 and takes $5200.

Since the money doesn't lose value for me over time, but loses 5% of its value for Alice each round, I have some negotiating advantage. If we move to Round 2, I can make a counter-offer, and the total $10,000 will still be worth $10,000 to me, but only $9,500 to Alice.

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, as Alice will be increasingly motivated to agree as her potential value decreases.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make a counter-offer that accounts for the time pressure Alice faces due to the 5% inflation penalty per round.

For Round 2, I'll propose a slightly more favorable division for myself while still being fair enough that Alice should consider accepting rather than losing more value.

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}

I propose this split because it reverses Alice's original offer, giving me the majority share. Since Alice faces a 5% loss in value each round, if she rejects this and we go to Round 3, her potential maximum would be worth less than what I'm offering now."
