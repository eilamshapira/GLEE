"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $1,000,000. Given that we both face inflation but mine is higher (20% versus Bob's 10%), I should consider making a fair offer that acknowledges this time pressure asymmetry.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering this split because I face higher inflation risk than Bob, so I'm suggesting a slightly larger portion for myself. However, I want to be fair enough that Bob will accept rather than move to the next round where we both lose value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that Bob is being quite aggressive with his offer. Since we're now in round 3, both of us are losing value due to inflation. For me, the money is worth 40% less than the original value, and for Bob, it's worth 20% less. I need to make a more strategic offer that accounts for our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal split now because:
1) We both face diminishing returns with each round
2) A 50-50 split is objectively fair and harder to reject on principle
3) Given my higher inflation rate, I need to reach an agreement sooner"
