"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll play as Alice in this bargaining game. I need to consider that with each passing round, the value of the money decreases by 10% for me due to inflation. In the first round, I should make a reasonable offer that Bob might accept.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose we split the money $600,000 for me and $400,000 for you, Bob. This is a fair offer considering we both need to come to an agreement, and time is working against us with the inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject Bob's offer. While I understand we need to reach an agreement, a split where I only get 35% is too low, especially since we're only in round 2."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more moderate offer that better balances our interests.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal 50-50 split of the money. This is the fairest division possible - $500,000 for each of us. We should try to reach an agreement soon since the inflation effect is reducing the value for me with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. With inflation already reducing my gain by 27.1% from the original value, it's better to secure $400,000 now rather than risk further depreciation through additional rounds of negotiation."
