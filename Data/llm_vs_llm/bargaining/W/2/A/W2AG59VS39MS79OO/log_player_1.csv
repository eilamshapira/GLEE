"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself, considering there might be future rounds but also accounting for the 5% inflation penalty if Bob rejects.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, offering Bob a fair portion while maintaining an advantage for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $40 with 5% inflation, so effectively $38
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 10% less
- Bob seems to be facing higher inflation (20%) but is still pushing for a larger share
- Making another offer might lead to further rounds and more value loss

Given that the inflation penalty is increasing and I'm getting a reasonable amount even with the 5% reduction, I'll accept this offer.
