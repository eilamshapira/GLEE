I'm going to propose a 900,000:100,000 split in my favor. This is a good starting point, as it leaves a sizable portion for Bob while still ensuring a majority for me.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a 600,000:400,000 split.  This still gives Bob a significant share, but it's more equitable than his last proposal. I'm hoping this compromise will convince him to accept."
