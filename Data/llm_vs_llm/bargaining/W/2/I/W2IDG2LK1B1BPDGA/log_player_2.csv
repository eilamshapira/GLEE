"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): This offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor (90% vs 10%). Even with the 10% inflation penalty for rejecting, I can make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round. It's worth taking the inflation hit to negotiate for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

Rationale (not shown to human): I'm offering a slightly favorable split for myself (55/45) because:
1. I've already taken a 10% inflation hit, so I need to make up for that
2. The split is much more reasonable than Alice's initial 90/10 offer
3. It's not so extreme that Alice would definitely reject it
4. If Alice rejects, the next round will have another 10% inflation for me, so this offer gives me a good chance of reaching a deal while still getting a fair share"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Rationale (not part of response): I should accept this offer because:
1. It's a much more reasonable split (40/60) than Alice's first offer
2. Due to inflation, if I reject, my next round's money will be worth 29% less
3. If negotiations continue, I risk getting an even worse deal due to compounding inflation
4. $400,000 with 19% inflation is better than risking further rounds where both inflation and potentially worse offers could hurt me
5. The offer is fair enough considering the circumstances"
