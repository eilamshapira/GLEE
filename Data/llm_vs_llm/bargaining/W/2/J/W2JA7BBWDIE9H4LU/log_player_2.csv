"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer.

She's proposing a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair and equitable. While I could try to negotiate for more by rejecting and making a counter-offer, there's risk in doing so:
1. We have a limited number of rounds
2. A 50-50 split is generally considered fair
3. Alice might respond to a counter-offer with a less favorable split

Given these considerations, I'll accept this fair offer.
