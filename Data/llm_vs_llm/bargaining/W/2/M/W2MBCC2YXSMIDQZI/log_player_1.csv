"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $10,000. Since I know there's a 20% inflation penalty for me each round, I want to reach an agreement soon, but I also want to secure a fair share.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money, which is fair to both of us. This way, we can both walk away with a substantial amount without risking inflation penalties."
