Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 60-40 in my favor. Given the inflation rates, this seems fair to start with. What do you think?

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, since my initial offer was rejected and your counter-offer didn't account for my higher inflation rate, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor this time. This should be more equitable considering the inflation impact on my share. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to take advantage of the situation, but the rate of inflation impacting her offers is working against her.  It's time to push for a more significant split in my favor."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, it seems we're at an impasse.  Let's be realistic - the inflation rate is hurting you more than me. I'm proposing 60/40 in my favor. This is my final offer.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given the significant impact of inflation on my share and the urgency to reach an agreement, I'm proposing a 50-50 split. This is fair considering the circumstances and the dwindling value of the money. Let's settle this and move forward. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While not ideal, the rapidly decreasing value of the money makes this offer the most sensible option to avoid walking away with nothing."
