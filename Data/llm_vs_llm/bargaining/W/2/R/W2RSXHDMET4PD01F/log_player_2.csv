"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60 for herself, claiming it's a ""fair share."" This doesn't seem entirely fair as it's a 40-60 split in her favor.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will be reduced by 5% due to inflation (making the total pot worth $95). However, I could propose a more favorable split for myself.

That said, $40 is still a significant portion, and if we keep negotiating, inflation will continue to reduce the total value. If Alice rejects my next offer, we'd be dealing with even less money in subsequent rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll take my chances and make a counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a fair 50-50 split, which is more equitable than Alice's initial offer. However, I need to account for the 5% inflation that affects my gains, so I'll adjust slightly in my favor to compensate.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split, slightly adjusted to account for the 5% inflation that affects me""}

This offer is reasonable because:
1. It's closer to an equal split than Alice's initial 40-60 proposal
2. The small adjustment in my favor (55-45) helps offset the inflation penalty I'm experiencing
3. It's still a fair enough offer that Alice might accept rather than risk further inflation in the next round"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has moved from her initial 40-60 split to a 43-57 split, showing some willingness to compromise
2. Current inflation effects:
   - My loss: 9.75% (meaning $43 is worth around $38.80)
   - Alice's loss: 19% (meaning her $57 is worth around $46.17)
3. If I reject:
   - Next round will have even higher inflation
   - My loss will increase to around 15%
   - There's no guarantee Alice will offer better terms

While this isn't the 50-50 split I hoped for, considering:
- The increasing inflation
- The fact that Alice has moved in my direction
- The risk of getting worse outcomes in future rounds
- The fact that Alice is actually suffering more from inflation than I am

{""decision"": ""accept""}

Better to secure $38.80 in real value now than risk further depreciation in subsequent rounds."
