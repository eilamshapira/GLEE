"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a fair split where I get $60 and you get $40. This is a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid the inflation penalty by agreeing now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think your offer was a bit biased. Considering the inflation penalty, I'm willing to take a bit more. Let's split it 55-45 and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response):
With 20% inflation penalty, if I accept now:
My $45 Ã— 0.8 = $36 effective value
It's less than my initial proposal, but waiting another round would reduce the value even further (another 20% loss). Better to secure a decent amount now than risk further depreciation or a worse offer later."
