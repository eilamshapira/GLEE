5000.0,5000.0,Let's split this 50/50 and be done with it.  No need for further rounds and we'll both walk away with a decent share.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
500.0,9500.0,"Alice, in light of the inflation eroding the value of your share, I’m proposing we settle now. Accepting this offer guarantees you $500 (though its worth is discounted compared to round 1), which is more than what you’d realistically secure if we prolong negotiations. Let’s close this deal quickly so you don’t suffer further erosion. – Bob",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"I know this is a very uneven split, Bob, but with each round my share keeps getting smaller.  Let's call it a day and I'll accept 20% of the money.",Alice,5,
