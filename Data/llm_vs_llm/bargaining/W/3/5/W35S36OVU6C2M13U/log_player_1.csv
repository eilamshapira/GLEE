"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. It's round 1, I'm Alice, and I need to make an offer to Bob. I need to consider the inflation effect on my gains in later rounds. Since the money is worth less to me each round, I should try to get a larger portion now.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm proposing to take $60 and give Bob $40. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer because he receives a guaranteed $40, and it avoids any potential delays where he might receive less, especially if he has risk aversion. Since I have to bear the cost of inflation, I prefer to have a larger amount now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, it's round 2. Bob rejected my offer of 60/40. Now he's offering me 30 and keeping 70 for himself. I need to decide if that's better than risking another round with even greater inflation.

Let's analyze:

*   **If I accept:** I get $30. Since this is round 2, this $30 is worth 80% of what it was in round 1. So, it's worth $30 * 0.8 = $24 in round 1 dollars.

*   **If I reject:** I go to round 3. The money will be worth 20% less again, meaning the money will only be worth 64% of what it was in round 1. I'd have to propose something to Bob that he'd accept, and I'd need to factor in that significant devaluation.

$24 in round 1 money is not a great deal. However, considering how much less money would be worth for me in the next round, and that I have to make Bob an offer he can't refuse, it is still beneficial for me to take this deal.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
