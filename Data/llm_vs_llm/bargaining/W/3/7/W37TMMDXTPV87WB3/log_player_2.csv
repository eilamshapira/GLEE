"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4000 and keeping $6000
2. If I reject, we move to next round where:
   * My $4000 would be worth only $3200 (20% less)
   * Alice's $6000 would be worth $5400 (10% less)
3. I could make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it, leading to even more depreciation

While the split isn't perfectly equal, getting $4000 now is better than risking further depreciation. If we continue negotiating, the total value available to split will keep decreasing.
