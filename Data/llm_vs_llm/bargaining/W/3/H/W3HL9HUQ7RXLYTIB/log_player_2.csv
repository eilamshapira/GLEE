"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor. This way, we both get a good amount, and we can avoid the value decrease over rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully, taking into account the inflation rates.

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, with her taking $600,000.

If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make an offer. However, I'll face 20% inflation compared to Alice's 5% inflation. This means the longer we negotiate, the worse my position becomes relative to Alice's.

Since I'm facing much higher inflation, accepting early is generally better for me than prolonging negotiations. A 40% share now might be better than trying to get more later when the money is worth less to me.
