"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. This is a fair and equal division
3. If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer, but:
   - There's no guarantee Alice will accept my offer
   - With each round, we risk more back-and-forth negotiations
4. The inflation doesn't affect me, but I don't know how it affects Alice
5. $500,000 is a substantial amount of money

Given that this is a perfectly fair split and there's no guarantee I could get a better deal that Alice would accept, I'll accept this offer.
