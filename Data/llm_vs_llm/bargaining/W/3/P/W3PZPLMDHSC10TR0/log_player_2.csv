"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $350,000 while she takes $650,000. If I reject and we move to the next round, I'll make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation.

Current value to me: $350,000
Value after one round of inflation: $800,000 (total) Ã— whatever portion I can negotiate

Given that this is just the first round and the offer gives Alice nearly twice what I would receive, I think I can negotiate better terms by making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while accounting for the inflation effect I'm experiencing.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests equally. With inflation affecting me by 20% each round, it's important we reach an agreement soon, and I believe an equal split is the most reasonable solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate this new offer. Alice has increased my share from $350,000 to $400,000, while reducing her share from $650,000 to $600,000.

I need to consider the inflation effect. The money is now worth 36% less to me than in the first round. If I reject and we go to round 4, the inflation will increase further.

Current value to me: $400,000 (already accounting for 36% inflation)
If I make a counter-offer and we continue negotiating, there's additional risk of the total amount becoming even less valuable to me.

Since Alice has moved significantly toward a more balanced split, and considering the increasing inflation pressure on my side, I'll accept this offer.
