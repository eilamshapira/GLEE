"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to factor in the diminishing value of the money over time for both me and Bob. Since I'm Alice and making the first offer, I'll try to be reasonable but also account for the inflation.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. My money is worth 20% less now, and Bob's is worth 5% less. Bob is offering me $55. I need to calculate if that's a better deal than what I might get in future rounds, considering the continued inflation.

Let's analyze:

*   **If I accept:** I get $55 now, which is worth $55 * 0.8 = $44 of round 1 money to me.
*   **If I reject:** I need to make an offer in the next round.

Since Bob's offer is somewhat close to my initial proposal, it might be wiser to accept it to avoid losing even more value in the next rounds.

""decision"": ""accept""
