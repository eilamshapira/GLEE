55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair considering that your inflation rate (20%) is higher than mine (10%), meaning you have more incentive to settle early. Let's agree now and both benefit.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Let's split it 50-50. It's a fair deal considering our inflation rates. If we wait, we'll both lose more value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, I rejected your 50-50 offer because with our different inflation rates, it actually favors you. My money loses 10% value each round while yours loses 20% - this means you have greater incentive to settle quickly. This 60-40 split accounts for that difference. If we keep going, we'll both lose more value, but you'll lose faster than me.",Alice,3,

55.0,45.0,"Alice, I understand your point about the inflation rates, but a 60-40 split is still too biased. This 45-55 split is more reasonable, considering we're already in round 4 and the money is losing value quickly. Let's settle before it's too late.",Bob,4,
