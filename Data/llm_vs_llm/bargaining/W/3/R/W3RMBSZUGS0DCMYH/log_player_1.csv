"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my first offer to Bob, trying to make a fair division while considering the differential inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair considering that your inflation rate (20%) is higher than mine (10%), meaning you have more incentive to settle early. Let's agree now and both benefit.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50-50. It's a fair deal considering our inflation rates. If we wait, we'll both lose more value. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Bob, I rejected your 50-50 offer because with our different inflation rates, it actually favors you. My money loses 10% value each round while yours loses 20% - this means you have greater incentive to settle quickly. This 60-40 split accounts for that difference. If we keep going, we'll both lose more value, but you'll lose faster than me.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about the inflation rates, but a 60-40 split is still too biased. This 45-55 split is more reasonable, considering we're already in round 4 and the money is losing value quickly. Let's settle before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45
