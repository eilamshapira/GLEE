"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair considering that your inflation rate (20%) is higher than mine (10%), meaning you have more incentive to settle early. Let's agree now and both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Alice after each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

For round 2, the value of the money for me is 100 * 0.8 = $80, and for Alice, it's 100 * 0.9 = $90.

Considering this, I'll make an offer where I get $42.50 (which is equivalent to 53.13% of the $80 value for me) and Alice gets $57.50 (which is equivalent to 63.89% of the $90 value for her, but closer to a 50-50 split in terms of the original $100).

However, to simplify the calculation and make a more straightforward offer, I'll aim for a split that seems fair given the inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50. It's a fair deal considering our inflation rates. If we wait, we'll both lose more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I rejected your 50-50 offer because with our different inflation rates, it actually favors you. My money loses 10% value each round while yours loses 20% - this means you have greater incentive to settle quickly. This 60-40 split accounts for that difference. If we keep going, we'll both lose more value, but you'll lose faster than me. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Considering the inflation rates, after 3 rounds, the value of the money for me is 100 * (0.8)^3 = $51.20, and for Alice, it's 100 * (0.9)^3 = $72.90.

Given these values, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 45, 
""alice_gain"": 55, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point about the inflation rates, but a 60-40 split is still too biased. This 45-55 split is more reasonable, considering we're already in round 4 and the money is losing value quickly. Let's settle before it's too late.""}"
