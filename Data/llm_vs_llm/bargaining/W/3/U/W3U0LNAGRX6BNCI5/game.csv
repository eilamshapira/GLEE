60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. Since you lose more value per round (10% vs my 5%), it's in your best interest to accept a reasonable offer early.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, considering the rapid decrease in value for me, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is still a fair deal given the circumstances, and it's better for both of us to settle early.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"Bob, I've reduced my share to 58-42 to show good faith. With your 10% depreciation rate per round vs my 5%, prolonging this negotiation hurts you more. This is a fair offer that gives us both good value while the money is still worth more.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
47.0,53.0,"Alice, given the significant depreciation on my side, I'm proposing a 53-47 split in my favor. We're losing value quickly, and it's crucial we reach an agreement soon. This offer is fair considering the inflation rates affecting us.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I'm offering a 55-45 split. We've both lost significant value already - my money is worth 19% less and yours is worth 34% less than at the start. This is a very reasonable offer considering our different depreciation rates, and further delays will hurt us both substantially.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
49.0,51.0,"Alice, with each passing round, my losses due to inflation are mounting. I'm now proposing a 51-49 split in my favor. This is our chance to end this before the value drops even further. Let's agree on this and move forward.",Bob,6,
