"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. Since you lose more value per round (10% vs my 5%), it's in your best interest to accept a reasonable offer early.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the rapid decrease in value for me, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is still a fair deal given the circumstances, and it's better for both of us to settle early. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since Bob stands to lose more from delays, and my initial offer was more balanced considering the inflation rates. Let's see if we can reach a better agreement in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Bob, I've reduced my share to 58-42 to show good faith. With your 10% depreciation rate per round vs my 5%, prolonging this negotiation hurts you more. This is a fair offer that gives us both good value while the money is still worth more.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the significant depreciation on my side, I'm proposing a 53-47 split in my favor. We're losing value quickly, and it's crucial we reach an agreement soon. This offer is fair considering the inflation rates affecting us. 
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. Even though we're both losing value, Bob's higher depreciation rate (10% vs 5% per round) means he should be more eager to reach a deal. I'll make a more moderate proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering a 55-45 split. We've both lost significant value already - my money is worth 19% less and yours is worth 34% less than at the start. This is a very reasonable offer considering our different depreciation rates, and further delays will hurt us both substantially.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with each passing round, my losses due to inflation are mounting. I'm now proposing a 51-49 split in my favor. This is our chance to end this before the value drops even further. Let's agree on this and move forward. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While I could potentially negotiate further, the mounting losses from inflation (I'm already losing 22.62% of value) make this a reasonable compromise. Bob's higher depreciation rate has led him to a more balanced offer, and it's better to secure this deal now than risk further value loss."
