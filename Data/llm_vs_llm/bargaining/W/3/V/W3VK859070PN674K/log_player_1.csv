"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer to start with, considering I'm dealing with inflation each round.

{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor because I face 5% inflation each round. This is actually fair because if we delay, my share becomes less valuable to me, while you might not face the same inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's go for an even split. This way we both get an equal share, and it's fair for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
