"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor because I face 5% inflation each round. This is actually fair because if we delay, my share becomes less valuable to me, while you might not face the same inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
