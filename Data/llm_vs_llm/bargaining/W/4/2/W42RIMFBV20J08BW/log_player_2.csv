"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice has offered me 4000$ out of 10,000$.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
- The total value will be worth 10% less to me (so my maximum potential gain would be 9000$)
- It will be worth 20% less to Alice (so her maximum would be 8000$)

The current offer of 4000$ is less than a fair 50-50 split. Given that I have the leverage of inflation affecting Alice more severely than me, I should reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is now worth less to Alice (20% less) than to me (10% less), I have some negotiating leverage. However, I should still be reasonable to increase the chances of acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Given the time pressure affects you more than me, I propose a fair 55-45 split that gives us both a good outcome before further depreciation""}

The reasoning behind this offer:
1. I'm asking for more than 50% but not being too greedy
2. For Alice, 4500$ now is better than waiting another round where her money would be worth even less
3. My message acknowledges the time pressure while remaining cooperative"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly better for me considering my higher inflation rate 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me 4200$ (worth 81% of original value = 3402$ in round 1 terms)
2. If I reject:
   - Next round my money will be worth 29% less than original
   - Alice's will be worth 49% less than original
   - The negotiating power shifts further in my favor, but the absolute value keeps decreasing

While I could reject and try to get a better deal, the diminishing value means:
1. My 4200$ now is worth 3402$ in original terms
2. If I wait another round, even getting 6000$ would be worth only 4260$ in original terms

Given this calculation, and the risk of further value loss, I should accept this offer. The difference in potential gain isn't worth the guaranteed loss from inflation.
