"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering that every round costs me 5% in value, waiting any longer hurts both of us. I offer you 7400 and I take 2600 so we both secure a fair share before further inflation hits. I believe this is a practical compromise that benefits us both â€“ please accept. 
# Alice gain: 7400 
# Bob gain: 2600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
