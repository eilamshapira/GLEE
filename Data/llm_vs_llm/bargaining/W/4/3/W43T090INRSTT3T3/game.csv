550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob. Since you face 10% inflation per round and I don't, it's in your interest to accept sooner. This fair offer gives you a substantial $450000 now, which is worth more than waiting for future rounds when your money will be worth less.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice. I appreciate your understanding of my inflation issue, but I believe a slightly larger share on my side is fair considering the rapid decrease in value for me. I'm offering you $450000, which is a generous amount, given the circumstances.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I understand your position, but we need to consider the game dynamics. With each round, your money loses 10% value. If we go to round 4, your $550K would be worth only ~$450K in round 1 terms. My offer of $400K now is worth ~$360K in original value to you - significantly better than what you'd get if we continue to round 5 or beyond. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions.",Alice,3,

500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice. At this point, a 50/50 split is the most equitable solution, given that we're both holding firm on our positions and considering how much I've already lost to inflation. Let's end this game on equal terms for a fair resolution.",Bob,4,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, let's be rational about this. Due to the 10% inflation per round for you, we're now at round 5 where your money has lost significant value. Your $500K offer from last round is actually worth only ~$365K in round 1 terms to you. My offer of $350K now is worth approximately $292K in original value - but if we continue to round 7, your position will be even worse. This offer acknowledges the game structure and gives you a reasonable outcome considering the circumstances. Further delays will only decrease your final value.",Alice,5,
