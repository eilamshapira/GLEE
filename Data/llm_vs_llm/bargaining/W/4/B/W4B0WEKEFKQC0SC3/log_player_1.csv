Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be practical, Alice. A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. This is a compromise considering the time pressure and inflation. We both walk away with a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Taking inflation into account, getting a little over $510,000 is a reasonable deal at this stage. Holding out for more could backfire as the pot keeps shrinking."
