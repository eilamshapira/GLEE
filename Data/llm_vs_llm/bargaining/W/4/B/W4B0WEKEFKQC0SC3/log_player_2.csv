Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise a little, but 50/50 is still too low for me considering the risk I'm taking. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is barely better than her first one, even considering the inflation. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."
