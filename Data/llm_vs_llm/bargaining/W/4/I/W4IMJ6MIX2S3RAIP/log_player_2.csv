"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair play, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. The offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 5% less for me
   - Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation
3. With inflation, waiting would mean $50 now is worth more than $50 (or even slightly more) in the next round

Given these factors, a fair 50-50 split in the first round is actually a good deal. Getting $50 now is better than risking a lower real value in future rounds.
