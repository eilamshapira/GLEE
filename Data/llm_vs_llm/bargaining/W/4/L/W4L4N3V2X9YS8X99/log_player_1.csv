"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I'll make my offer, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. My money is worth 5% less than round 1, and Bob's is worth 10% less.

Let's analyze:

*   **My perspective:** Getting $45 now is like getting $45 / 0.95 = $47.37 in round 1 money.
*   **Bob's perspective (unknown to me, but implicitly considered):** He is getting $55, which is like getting $55 / 0.9 = $61.11 in round 1 money.

Since I would have gotten 60$ in round 1 in my offer, and I will only receive an equivalent to 47.37$, I will reject this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn again. Remember, the inflation effect is cumulative. For me, it's now 5% less *again* compared to round 2, meaning my money is worth only 90.25% of its original value. For Bob, it is now 10% less again compared to round 2, meaning his money is worth only 81% of its original value.
I need to make an offer that is attractive to Bob but also compensates me for the decreasing value of the money.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 57,
""bob_gain"": 43
}
```"
