"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Waiting longer means I'll get even less.
* **Alice's Offer:** While not ideal, Alice is still offering me a reasonable portion. It's better to take this offer than risk getting a worse deal in a later round where the money is worth even less."
