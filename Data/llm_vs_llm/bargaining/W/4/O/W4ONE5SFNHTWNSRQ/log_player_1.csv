"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a substantial portion right away without risking inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose that you get $70 and I get $30. I understand you might prefer to wait and make your own proposal later, but further delay will cost me due to inflation. I believe this offer gives you a better share than your previous offer, and Iâ€™d like us to settle this now so we both avoid unnecessary losses. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
