"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a substantial portion right away without risking inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 30, ""alice_gain"": 70, ""message"": ""Alice, I propose that you get $70 and I get $30. I understand you might prefer to wait and make your own proposal later, but further delay will cost me due to inflation. I believe this offer gives you a better share than your previous offer, and Iâ€™d like us to settle this now so we both avoid unnecessary losses. What do you say?""}"
