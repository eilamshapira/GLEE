"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that's fair but also accounts for the inflation risk I face.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I get $550,000 and you get $450,000. This is a reasonable split given that I face a 10% inflation penalty if we go to another round, which would significantly reduce the value of my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
