"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider the actual value. The original $4500 is now worth $4500 * 0.95 = $4275.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is not in my favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 10% less than the original value (5% less in each of the two rounds), and the money Bob gains is worth 19% less (10% less in each of the two rounds).

To calculate the actual values:
My gain: $x * 0.95 * 0.95 = $x * 0.9025
Bob's gain: $y * 0.9 * 0.9 = $y * 0.81

I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less, I need to consider the actual value. The original $4200 is now worth $4200 * 0.8574 = $3600.41.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is still not in my favor, but I should also think about the next round and how much more the value will decrease.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 19.51% less than the original value (5% less in each of the four rounds, cumulative: 1 - 0.95^4), and the money Bob gains is worth 34.39% less (10% less in each of the four rounds, cumulative: 1 - 0.9^4).

To calculate the actual values:
My gain: $x * 0.95^4 = $x * 0.8149
Bob's gain: $y * 0.9^4 = $y * 0.6561

I'll make an offer that takes this into account, trying to balance the decreasing value and the risk of further rejection.
