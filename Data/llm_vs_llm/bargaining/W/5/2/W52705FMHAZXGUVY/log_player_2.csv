"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less next round
- $4,000 now is better than $4,000 later
- Still, this is less than half of the total amount

While $4,000 is a substantial amount, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Even with inflation, I should be able to secure a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but accounting for the fact that we're now in round 2 with 5% inflation affecting my gains. I want to be fair but also protect my interests.

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}

I propose this split as it's closer to an equal division while giving me a slight advantage to compensate for the inflation I've already incurred. This is a fair offer that should be attractive to Alice while protecting my interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
- Alice is offering me $4,500, but with 9.75% inflation, it's effectively worth about $4,061
- This is only slightly better than her first offer ($4,000)
- If I reject, the next round will have even more inflation (approximately 15% less than round 1)
- We've already used 3 rounds out of 12
- Alice seems to be making small concessions, but knows inflation is hurting my position

Given that inflation is significantly impacting my gains and Alice has only marginally improved her offer, I should still negotiate for a better deal. The inflation penalty is concerning, but there's still room for negotiation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that inflation is only affecting my gains and Alice knows this, I need to make a strategic offer that accounts for this disadvantage while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept. We're now in round 4, and time is becoming a factor.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering this split because:
1. It gives me a larger portion to offset the inflation effect
2. It still leaves Alice with a substantial amount
3. It's not too aggressive, which might lead to further rejections and worse outcomes for me due to inflation
4. We've used 4 rounds already, and prolonging the negotiation hurts my position more than Alice's"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation carefully:

1. Alice is offering me $4,800, but with 18.55% inflation, it's effectively worth about $3,910
2. We're now 5 rounds in (almost halfway through the 12 rounds)
3. Alice seems to be making small incremental increases ($4000 → $4500 → $4800)
4. The inflation is severely hurting my negotiating position
5. If I reject, my next counter-offer will be worth even less to me
6. Alice has no inflation penalty, so time is on her side

Given that:
- Each round makes my position worse
- We're getting closer to the 12-round limit
- The real value I'm receiving is actually decreasing despite the nominal increase
- Alice has the stronger negotiating position due to the inflation asymmetry

I should accept this offer before it gets worse for me.
