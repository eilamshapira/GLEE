"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. Even though you have an advantage, consider that prolonging the game might make me less cooperative in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Bob's offer is 50-50, which means:
- I would get $50 (full value)
- Bob would get $50 (but at 95% value due to inflation = $47.50 real value)

If I reject, we go to the next round where:
- I can make another offer
- Bob's money will be worth another 5% less
- But Bob might become less cooperative as warned

While I could try to negotiate for a better deal, Bob's warning about becoming less cooperative is worth considering. Also, $50 is still a decent outcome for me, and we avoid the risk of further rounds potentially leading to a worse outcome.
