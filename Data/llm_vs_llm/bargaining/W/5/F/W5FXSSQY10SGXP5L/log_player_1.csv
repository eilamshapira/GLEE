"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the declining value of the money with each round. I'll start with a proposal that gives me a slight advantage, considering I'm the one making the first offer.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this offer. I need to consider the inflation for both of us.

*   **My perspective:** Getting $4000 now is equivalent to $4000 * 0.8 = $3200 in Round 1 dollars.
*   **Bob's perspective:** Giving me $4000 means he gets $6000, which is equivalent to $6000 * 0.9 = $5400 in Round 1 dollars.

If I reject, it will be my turn to propose, and the money's value will decrease even further. Let's see how a counteroffer might look. If I were to offer him $5000 in the next round, which is very unlikely that I will, it will actually be worth $4000 in round 1 values, and for me to have $5000 it is worth $3200.

Given the inflation, and the decent amount I am getting, I will accept.
