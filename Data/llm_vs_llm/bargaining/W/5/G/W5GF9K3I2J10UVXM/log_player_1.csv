"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 9999, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Bob, by accepting my proposal now you secure $1 at full value. If you reject, you'll get to propose next round, but any money you receive then will be subject to a 5% devaluation. Waiting only hurts your outcome. Please accept this offer and avoid unnecessary loss.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. This way, we both get a fair share and avoid the risk of devaluation in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your offer. While an even split sounds fair in nominal terms, I know that by being the proposer in the next round my position improves further—especially since your share continues to devalue with each round while mine stays intact. I'll pass on the current offer and make a counterproposal in Round 3.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 9900, ""bob_gain"": 100, ""message"": ""Bob, here's my offer: I take $9900 and you get $100 nominal. Given that in this round your money is already worth only 90% of its face value and waiting another round will further reduce it (to just 85% in Round 4), accepting $100 now secures you more value than you could expect by delaying. Let's settle now before further devaluation erodes your share.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's compromise.  I'll accept a slightly lower share, but it's better than waiting for further devaluation. This way we can both secure a decent amount and avoid the risk of losing more money. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, with your share already suffering a 14.26% devaluation and the likelihood of further erosion if we prolong negotiations, I'm confident that by proposing in the next round I can secure an even better outcome for myself. I believe waiting one more round will allow us to reach an agreement that reflects the true value disparity between our shares. Therefore, I'll pass on this even split offer for now.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 9999, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Bob, here's my offer for Round 5: I take $9999 and you get $1 nominal. Remember, while my money retains its full value, your money continues to suffer a 5% compounded loss each round—in this round your $1 is only worth about $0.81 in real terms. If you reject, you become the proposer in Round 6, but you'll be in a bind: as the proposer, you'll have to offer me nearly the entire $10,000 because I'm fully patient, meaning your eventual effective gain will be essentially nothing. Accepting this tiny share now is your only chance to secure even a minimal value. I urge you to accept this offer and avoid further devaluation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we both know that this offer is a far cry from a fair split, but the current inflation is significantly hurting my share. Accepting this offer is the only way I can secure a decent portion of the money. I hope you understand my position and choose to accept. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, I understand the pressures of inflation on your side, but offering me only $1000 is far below what I can secure as the proposer in the next round. With my value remaining intact and your share devaluing further if we wait, I can guarantee myself nearly the whole amount by moving to Round 7. I must therefore reject your offer.""}"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500, ""bob_gain"": 9500, ""message"": ""Bob, here's my offer for Round 7: I take $500 and you get $9,500 in nominal dollars. Remember that in this round your money is discounted by about 26.5% (a multiplier of roughly 0.7351), so your effective value would be 9500 × 0.7351 ≈ 6984. If you reject and become the proposer in Round 8, you'll control the split but your entire pot will then be discounted by an additional 5% (a multiplier of about 0.6983), leaving you with nearly the same effective payoff. Since my offer matches your best alternative while avoiding further delay, I encourage you to accept and settle now.""}"
