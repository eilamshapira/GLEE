Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, by accepting my proposal now you secure $1 at full value. If you reject, you'll get to propose next round, but any money you receive then will be subject to a 5% devaluation. Waiting only hurts your outcome. Please accept this offer and avoid unnecessary loss.

# Alice gain: 9999

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, here's my offer: I take $9900 and you get $100 nominal. Given that in this round your money is already worth only 90% of its face value and waiting another round will further reduce it (to just 85% in Round 4), accepting $100 now secures you more value than you could expect by delaying. Let's settle now before further devaluation erodes your share. 
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 9900

{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, let's compromise.  I'll accept a slightly lower share, but it's better than waiting for further devaluation. This way we can both secure a decent amount and avoid the risk of losing more money.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, here's my offer for Round 5: I take $9999 and you get $1 nominal. Remember, while my money retains its full value, your money continues to suffer a 5% compounded loss each round—in this round your $1 is only worth about $0.81 in real terms. If you reject, you become the proposer in Round 6, but you'll be in a bind: as the proposer, you'll have to offer me nearly the entire $10000 because I'm fully patient, meaning your eventual effective gain will be essentially nothing. Accepting this tiny share now is your only chance to secure even a minimal value. I urge you to accept this offer and avoid further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 9999

{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""Alice, we both know that this offer is a far cry from a fair split, but the current inflation is significantly hurting my share. Accepting this offer is the only way I can secure a decent portion of the money. I hope you understand my position and choose to accept.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, here's my offer for Round 7: I take $500 and you get $9500 in nominal dollars. Remember that in this round your money is discounted by about 26.5% (a multiplier of roughly 0.7351), so your effective value would be 9500 × 0.7351 ≈ 6984. If you reject and become the proposer in Round 8, you'll control the split but your entire pot will then be discounted by an additional 5% (a multiplier of about 0.6983), leaving you with nearly the same effective payoff. Since my offer matches your best alternative while avoiding further delay, I encourage you to accept and settle now. 
# Bob gain: 9500 
# Alice gain: 500
