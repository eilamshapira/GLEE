"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which might seem fair at first glance. However, I know that:
1. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
2. The money devalues faster for Alice (20%) than for me (10%) each round
3. This gives me some negotiating leverage

Since I have this advantage, I can likely get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round. Alice will be more inclined to accept since her money will devalue more quickly than mine.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that the money has already devalued (worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice), and that Alice knows the money will continue to devalue faster for her, I'll propose a split that's more in my favor but still reasonable enough that she should accept to avoid further devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's better than a 50-50 split, reflecting my stronger negotiating position
2. Alice still gets a substantial amount
3. If she rejects, her next round value will decrease by 20% while mine only by 10%, making it rational for her to accept now"
