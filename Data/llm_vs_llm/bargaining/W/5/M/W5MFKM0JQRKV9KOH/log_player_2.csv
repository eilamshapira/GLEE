"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me $100,000, I need to consider that if I reject and make a counter-offer, the total value will be reduced by 20% due to inflation (for me). However, Alice's current proposal heavily favors her with a 90-10 split, which seems quite unfair.

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced division that accounts for the inflation I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me since I'm the one affected by inflation. This gives you a substantial portion while recognizing that if we continue to another round, the total value decreases for me by 20% again. This is a reasonable compromise that benefits us both."
