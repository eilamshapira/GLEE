"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the need to divide quickly due to inflation. How about a slightly better split for me this round? 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll have to make a decision.

Since the total amount is $10,000, and it's worth 5% less for me, the actual value I'd get from Bob's offer is:
4750 / 1.05 = approximately 4523.81

Given this, I think I can try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, and this is the third round (first round + two rejections), I've already lost about 10% of its value (5% in round 2 and another 5% now).

To make up for this loss and considering Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 4875, 
""bob_gain"": 5125, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground before inflation eats away too much value.""}"
