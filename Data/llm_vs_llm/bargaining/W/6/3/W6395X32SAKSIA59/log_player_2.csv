"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Current offer: $350,000 for me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The money will be worth 5% less to me
   * Maximum I could potentially get would be worth: $950,000 * 0.95 = $902,500
   * But Alice would likely reject a very uneven split

While $350,000 is less than half, it's still a substantial amount. Rejecting would mean risking losing 5% value, and Alice might make an even less favorable offer in future rounds. Since this is a reasonably fair first offer, I'll accept it.
