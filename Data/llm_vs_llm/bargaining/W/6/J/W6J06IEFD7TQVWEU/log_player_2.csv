"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split it 60/40, a fair start 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000. While it's not a terrible offer, I believe we can reach a more equitable arrangement. Since there are still 11 rounds left, I'll reject this offer and propose a more balanced split in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a fair 50-50 split, which is the most equitable solution.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I suggest a perfectly fair 50-50 split. This way we both walk away equally happy.""}"
