"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I should carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000 out of the $10,000 total. While this isn't an even split, it's still a substantial amount. Since there's no inflation affecting my portion in future rounds, I don't lose value by negotiating further. However, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still giving Alice a decent portion to increase the chances of acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This is a fair offer that gives me a slight advantage but still leaves Alice with a substantial amount. It's more balanced than her initial proposal of 40/60 split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has improved her offer from the initial 4000/6000 split to 4500/5500
2. I now know that Alice's gains are affected by inflation (9.75% less value for her)
3. Her 5500 is actually worth less to her now (approximately 4964 in round 1 value)
4. My 4500 maintains its full value since I'm not affected by inflation
5. If I reject, we'll go to another round, and Alice's portion will be worth even less to her

Given that:
- The offer is more favorable than the first round
- Alice is under inflation pressure
- I might not get a significantly better deal in future rounds
- My portion maintains its value
