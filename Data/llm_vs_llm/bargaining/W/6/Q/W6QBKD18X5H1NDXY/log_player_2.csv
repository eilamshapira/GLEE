"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me only 5% ($50,000) of the total amount ($1,000,000)
2. While this is still a significant amount of money, it's a very unequal split
3. Since there's no inflation penalty for me in future rounds, I don't lose anything by rejecting and making a counter-offer
4. I can propose a more equitable split in the next round

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but still giving Alice a bit more to increase the chances of acceptance:

{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000}

This is a more reasonable offer where:
1. I get 40% ($400,000)
2. Alice gets 60% ($600,000)
3. It's much more equitable than the previous 95-5 split
4. It's still generous enough to Alice that she might accept it"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has doubled her offer to me from $50,000 to $100,000
2. I now know that Alice faces inflation (9.75% less value for her)
3. $900,000 for Alice is now worth effectively $812,250 due to inflation
4. I don't face any inflation, so my $100,000 maintains full value
5. However, $100,000 is still only 10% of the total, which is quite low
6. Since I don't face inflation penalties, I can safely continue negotiating

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer as I can still try for a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now that I know Alice faces inflation penalties while I don't, I can adjust my strategy. I'll still make a reasonable offer but slightly more in my favor than before:

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

My reasoning:
1. This is a 45-55 split, which is still favorable to Alice but more balanced
2. Given that Alice faces inflation penalties, she might be more motivated to accept this offer
3. If she rejects, her next portion will be worth even less due to inflation
4. The offer is fair enough that it could be seen as a reasonable compromise
5. I maintain my negotiating position without being too aggressive"
