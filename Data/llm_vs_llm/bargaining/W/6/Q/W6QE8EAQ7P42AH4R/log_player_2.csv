"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor. This way, we both get a fair share, and we can avoid the effects of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, giving me $4,000 and herself $6,000.

Given the inflation rates (20% for me vs. 5% for Alice per round), waiting is significantly more costly for me than for her. If I reject and we go another round, my potential earnings will decline faster.

If I make a counter-offer next round, the total value to me would already be worth 20% less. Even if I proposed a more favorable split, I'd be dividing a smaller pie from my perspective.

Since this is the first round and the inflation asymmetry puts me at a disadvantage in negotiations, accepting $4,000 now is better than risking further depreciation.
