"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10000
2. If I reject, we move to round 2, where the money is worth 20% less to me
3. In round 2, I can make my own proposal, but $4000 now would be worth more than $5000 in the next round
4. This is a reasonable first offer, considering I need to factor in inflation
