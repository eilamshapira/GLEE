"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split that slightly favors me since Bob's inflation rate is lower than mine.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable first offer that acknowledges both players need to reach an agreement, while giving me a slight advantage since I'm more affected by inflation."
