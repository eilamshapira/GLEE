"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing I get $40 while she keeps $60. While this isn't an equal split, it's not terribly unfair. However, since I'll have the opportunity to make a counter-offer in the next round, I believe I can propose a more equitable distribution.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair 50-50 split, which is the most equitable solution. This gives both of us an equal share and is a reasonable counter to Alice's previous offer.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}"
