45.0,55.0,"Alice, after several rounds we've seen that demands shift and time is limited. I propose a fair split where you get $45, which, while slightly lower than your previous offer, avoids further risk and delays. Accepting now ensures you secure a definite sum rather than facing potential losses in subsequent rounds.",Bob,4,
