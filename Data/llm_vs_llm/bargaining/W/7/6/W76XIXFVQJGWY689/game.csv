0.0,1000000.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid further rounds—which would shrink my share by 20% each time—I propose that you receive the full $1000000 now. I understand if this may seem surprising, but given that any delay significantly devalues my portion (and I’m uncertain about your inflation situation), I believe this is the only fair way to secure an immediate agreement. I look forward to your response.",Alice,1,
