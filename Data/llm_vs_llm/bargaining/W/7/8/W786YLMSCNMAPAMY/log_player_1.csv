"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I'll make the first offer. Considering the inflation affecting us differently, I want to secure a good portion for myself early on.

Here's my offer in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider my gains and the inflation.

Since my money is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's offer gives me $525,000, I should accept it.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
