"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives slightly more to me while still being fair enough for Bob to consider.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This is a fair initial offer - you get a bit more, but Bob still gets a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

Due to 10% inflation on Bob's side, his $55 is actually worth $49.50 to him, while my $45 maintains its full value. This means the real value split is $45 for me and $49.50 for Bob - quite balanced.

However, since I know I could make another offer and Bob's value will decrease further due to inflation, I might get a better deal by rejecting. But there's also the risk of prolonged negotiation leading to no deal at all.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer since it's reasonably fair in real terms, and it's better to secure a deal now than risk further rounds of negotiation."
