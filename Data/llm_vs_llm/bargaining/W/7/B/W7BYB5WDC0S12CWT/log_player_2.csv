"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose we split the money more evenly, with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This is fairer than your initial offer, and remember that inflation affects me by 10% each round, so it's beneficial for both of us to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
