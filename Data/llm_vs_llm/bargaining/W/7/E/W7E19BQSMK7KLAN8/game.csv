5500.0,4500.0,"Let's start with a fair split that gives us both a good amount. This gives me a slight edge, but it's still a great deal for you, Bob.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Since you proposed a slight edge for yourself last round, I'll do the same this time. Let's see if we can settle on a fair split soon, considering the decreasing value of the money.",Bob,2,

5200.0,4800.0,"Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This is a slightly better offer for you than my first, acknowledging your rejection. Let's secure a good deal before inflation hurts us both more.",Alice,3,

4800.0,5200.0,"I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle, Alice. Let's keep this trend going, but I believe a 52-48 split in my favor this round is fair, considering the inflation impact on my side is greater. We should aim to settle soon.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5050.0,4950.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. Inflation is eating away at both our potential gains. This is a very close to equal split, and we should accept it to secure a decent outcome. A slight edge for me, but a safe bet for both.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4950.0,5050.0,"Alice, I see your point about inflation affecting us both. Let's flip your last offer to 5050 for me and 4950 for you. This way, we're nearly equal, but I get a slight edge this round due to the higher inflation rate on my side. We need to settle soon to minimize losses.",Bob,6,
