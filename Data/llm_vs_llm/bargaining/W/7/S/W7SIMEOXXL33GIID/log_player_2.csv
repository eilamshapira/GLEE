"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This seems fair considering the inflation risk I'm taking. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000 total. While this isn't a 50-50 split, there are a few considerations:

1. I don't experience any inflation risk, so my $4,000 value is guaranteed
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it
3. $4,000 is still a substantial amount

However, since I don't face any inflation risk, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. There's no downside for me in continuing to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split since I don't face any inflation risk, but I'll still be reasonable to encourage acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us, and since I don't face inflation risk, I can guarantee this is my true valuation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'll take 5500, you take 4500. This considers the inflation risk I'm facing. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this new offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4,500, which is better than her initial offer of $4,000
2. Due to inflation, Alice's $5,500 is actually worth 36% less to her than in round 1
3. My $4,500 maintains its full value since I don't face inflation
4. The split is more balanced than the initial 60-40 offer
5. If I reject, the game continues and Alice's inflation penalty increases further

Given that this is a more reasonable offer and I get a guaranteed $4,500 with no inflation risk, I should accept.
