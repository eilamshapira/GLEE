"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis (taking into account that money “depreciates” by 20% per round for Bob but not for me), the subgame‐perfect reasoning leads to the following outcome in round 1. Namely, if you (Bob) reject my offer in round 1, then in round 2 you would propose a division that (after discounting your future payoff by 20% for that round) would leave you with an effective “continuation value” of about $2,621.44 in today’s dollars. (Briefly, working from the final round backward we find that in round 12, as proposer, Bob would grab almost all of the $10,000; then in round 11 I’d have to “buy” Bob’s agreement by offering him about $8,000 nominal, and so on. Following the chain of minimal acceptable offers, one eventually finds that in round 1 Bob’s “reservation” nominal amount is about $2,621.44.) 

Thus, to have you indifferent between accepting now and waiting for your turn next round, I must offer you at least $2,621.44 nominal. In order to maximize my gain while still leaving you just that much, my proposal is to keep the remainder. 

Here is my offer in the requested JSON format:
