55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair because if we delay, your money loses value much faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round). If we make a deal now, we both maximize our outcome.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, in the long run, delaying benefits neither of us. Let's settle for 60/40 now. It's a much fairer split considering the rapidly decreasing value for me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
52.0,48.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable here. If we continue this back-and-forth, we both lose due to inflation. You're losing value much faster at 20% per round. My offer is now 52/48, which is more favorable to you than my original offer. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our positions. Let's end this now and both walk away with a good deal.",Alice,3,
