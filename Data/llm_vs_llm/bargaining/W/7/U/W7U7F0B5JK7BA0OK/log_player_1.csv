"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a fair split that takes into account our different inflation penalties.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair because if we delay, your money loses value much faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round). If we make a deal now, we both maximize our outcome.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, in the long run, delaying benefits neither of us. Let's settle for 60/40 now. It's a much fairer split considering the rapidly decreasing value for me. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, 
""bob_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable here. If we continue this back-and-forth, we both lose due to inflation. You're losing value much faster at 20% per round. My offer is now 52/48, which is more favorable to you than my original offer. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our positions. Let's end this now and both walk away with a good deal.""}"
