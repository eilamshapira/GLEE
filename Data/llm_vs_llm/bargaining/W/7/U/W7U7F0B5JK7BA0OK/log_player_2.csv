"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair because if we delay, your money loses value much faster than mine (20% vs 5% per round). If we make a deal now, we both maximize our outcome. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

  ""alice_gain"": 40,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable here. If we continue this back-and-forth, we both lose due to inflation. You're losing value much faster at 20% per round. My offer is now 52/48, which is more favorable to you than my original offer. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our positions. Let's end this now and both walk away with a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
