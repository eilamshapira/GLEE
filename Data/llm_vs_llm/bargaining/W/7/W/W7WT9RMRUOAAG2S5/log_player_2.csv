"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice offers a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, the money will be worth 20% less for me in the next round
3. 5000$ now is better than potentially getting more later with the 20% inflation penalty
4. I'm not sure Alice will offer better terms in future rounds
5. This is a reasonable first offer
