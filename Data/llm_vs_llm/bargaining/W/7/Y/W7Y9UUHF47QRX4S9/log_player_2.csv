"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer...

This is a fair, equal split of the money. Since I know there's no inflation penalty for me in future rounds, I could try to negotiate for more by rejecting. However, Alice might then make a less favorable offer, and we could end up in a back-and-forth that wastes time.

The 50-50 split is a classic fair solution, and there's no guarantee I could get a better deal. I'll accept this reasonable offer.
