"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob. I want to propose a fair division that Bob would likely accept, considering this is the first round.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the $10,000, with each of us receiving $5,000. This is a fair division that respects both our interests. Since there's no inflation affecting my value of the money, I'm comfortable with an even split as a starting point."
