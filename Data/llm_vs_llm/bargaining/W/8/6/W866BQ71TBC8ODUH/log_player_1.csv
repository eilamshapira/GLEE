"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","To start the game, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money decreases in value over rounds, it's beneficial to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Considering the inflation rates, I'll propose a division that slightly favors me to account for the higher inflation rate I'm subject to, but still keeps the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's settle early to maximize value.""
}
```

This offer gives me $550,000 and Bob $450,000, aiming to find a middle ground that acknowledges the different inflation rates we're both facing. The message encourages Bob to accept the offer to avoid further devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My offer is more favorable considering the decreasing value 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the new values due to inflation:

- My gain is worth 20% less, so if I were to gain $400,000, its actual value to me would be $400,000 * 0.8 = $320,000.
- Bob's gain is worth 5% less, but this affects his perception, not mine directly.

Considering Bob's offer gives me $400,000 (valued at $320,000 to me due to inflation) and him $600,000, and taking into account that with each round, the value of the money decreases further for me, I need to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer versus making a counteroffer.

However, Bob's offer seems quite skewed in his favor, especially considering the significant drop in value for me due to the higher inflation rate. Given that I have the opportunity to make a counteroffer in the next round, which could potentially be more favorable to me (or at least, not as skewed), I decide to reject this offer and proceed to make my own proposal in the next round, hoping to negotiate a better split.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Given that we're in Round 3 and considering the inflation rates:

- The original $1,000,000 is now worth 20% less to me for each round that has passed. So, for me, its value has decreased by 20% in Round 1 and another 20% in Round 2, making it worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of its original value.
- For Bob, the value has decreased by 5% each round, so it's worth 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of its original value to him.

To make an attractive offer while considering these devaluations, I'll aim for a split that acknowledges the decreasing value but also tries to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Since the last offer from Bob was quite skewed in his favor, I'll propose a division that leans slightly towards me to compensate for the higher inflation rate I'm experiencing, but still offers Bob a significant share.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a fair middle ground before it's too late.""
}
```

This offer gives me $520,000 and Bob $480,000, aiming to strike a balance that considers the inflation rates and encourages Bob to accept to avoid further devaluation. The message emphasizes the importance of finding a mutually beneficial agreement sooner rather than later."
