"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's settle early to maximize value. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into consideration.

In round 1, the total value for me was $1,000,000. Now, it's worth $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000 for me.
For Alice, the total value was $1,000,000. Now, it's worth $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000 for her.

Considering this, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""My offer is more favorable considering the decreasing value""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's find a fair middle ground before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
