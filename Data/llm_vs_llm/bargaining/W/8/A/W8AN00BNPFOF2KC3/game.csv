1000000.0,0.0,"Bob, notice that every round you lose 10% value while I stay unaffected. I’m prepared to finalize the deal now—lock in your share (before any further depreciation) by accepting this proposal.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand we both want to maximize our gains. Due to the 10% depreciation affecting me each round, I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for myself. This is fair since you have no time pressure and could theoretically wait me out. If we continue to another round, the total value to me decreases, which means I'd have to ask for more nominal dollars to get the same value, leaving less for you. This is a win-win that acknowledges our different positions.",Bob,2,

125000.0,875000.0,"Bob, I know you're eyeing your future advantage as proposer, but remember that waiting further means even more depreciation for you. In round4 you'd be set to capture nearly the entire pie—but with a 30% reduction, that’s effectively about $700000. I'm offering you $875000 nominal this round, which gives you an effective $700000 now. It's a fair deal that preempts further losses from depreciation. Let's settle now for our mutual best interest.",Alice,3,
