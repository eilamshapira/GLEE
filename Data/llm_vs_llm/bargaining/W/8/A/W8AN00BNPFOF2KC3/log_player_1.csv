"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 1000000, ""bob_gain"": 0, ""message"": ""Bob, notice that every round you lose 10% value while I stay unaffected.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we both want to maximize our gains. Due to the 10% depreciation affecting me each round, I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for myself. This is fair since you have no time pressure and could theoretically wait me out. If we continue to another round, the total value to me decreases, which means I'd have to ask for more nominal dollars to get the same value, leaving less for you. This is a win-win that acknowledges our different positions. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 125000, ""bob_gain"": 875000, ""message"": ""Bob, I know you're eyeing your future advantage as proposer, but remember that waiting further means even more depreciation for you. In round4 you'd be set to capture nearly the entire pie—but with a 30% reduction, that’s effectively about $700,000. I'm offering you $875,000 nominal this round, which gives you an effective $700,000 now. It's a fair deal that preempts further losses from depreciation. Let's settle now for our mutual best interest.""}"
