"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, notice that every round you lose 10% value while I stay unaffected. I’m prepared to finalize the deal now—lock in your share (before any further depreciation) by accepting this proposal. 
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate Alice's offer.

Alice is offering me $0 and taking the entire $1,000,000 for herself. While she's correct that with each round the money is worth 10% less to me (but not to her), accepting $0 is clearly not in my best interest regardless of inflation.

If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-proposal in the next round. Even though the total value to me will be 10% less (worth $900,000 to me), I can still propose a division that gives me some money, which is better than $0.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer that acknowledges the time pressure I'm under but still ensures I get a fair portion.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand we both want to maximize our gains. Due to the 10% depreciation affecting me each round, I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for myself. This is fair since you have no time pressure and could theoretically wait me out. If we continue to another round, the total value to me decreases, which means I'd have to ask for more nominal dollars to get the same value, leaving less for you. This is a win-win that acknowledges our different positions.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I know you're eyeing your future advantage as proposer, but remember that waiting further means even more depreciation for you. In round4 you'd be set to capture nearly the entire pie—but with a 30% reduction, that’s effectively about $700000. I'm offering you $875000 nominal this round, which gives you an effective $700000 now. It's a fair deal that preempts further losses from depreciation. Let's settle now for our mutual best interest. 
# Bob gain: 875000 
# Alice gain: 125000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate Alice's offer.

Alice is offering me $875,000 out of the $1,000,000. With the 19% depreciation in this round, that would be worth about $708,750 to me (875,000 × 0.81).

Alice's logic is sound - she recognizes that if we go to round 4, I could ask for most of the money, but it would be worth 30% less to me then. She's offering me a deal now that gives me approximately what I would effectively get after that depreciation.

This is actually a reasonable offer that acknowledges our unique positions. I get a significant majority of the nominal amount, which compensates for my depreciation penalty, while Alice still gets some value.
