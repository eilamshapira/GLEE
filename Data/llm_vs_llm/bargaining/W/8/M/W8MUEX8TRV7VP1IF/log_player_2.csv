Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, I'll get 45, but its value is reduced by 19% due to inflation. So, the actual value I'll get is approximately 45 * 0.81 = 36.45.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the total value of the money is decreasing. Since I don't know the exact inflation rate for Alice, I'll try to make a reasonable offer.
