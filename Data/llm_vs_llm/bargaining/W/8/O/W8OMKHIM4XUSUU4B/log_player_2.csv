"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 7888.82 
# Alice gain: 2111.18 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer gives me $7888.82, which is a substantial portion (almost 79%) of the money. While I could try to negotiate for more in the next round, I need to consider that with each passing round, the money is worth 5% less to me. If I reject and make a counter-offer, the total value will already be reduced by 5% for me and 10% for Alice.

Let me analyze this offer carefully. Getting 79% of the total is already very favorable to me. If I reject, I risk ending up with less in future rounds due to inflation, and there's also the possibility that we might not reach an agreement within 12 rounds.
