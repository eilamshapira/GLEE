"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer of a 50-50 split, which would give each of us $5,000.

This is a completely fair offer that gives us equal shares. If I reject and move to the next round, the total amount will decrease by 10% to $9,000, meaning even if I got a larger percentage in the next round, the absolute value might be less than $5,000.

Since this is a perfectly fair first offer with no need for negotiation, I'll accept it.
