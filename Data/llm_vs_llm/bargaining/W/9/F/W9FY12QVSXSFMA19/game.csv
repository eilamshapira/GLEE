5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a fair 50-50 split where we both get $5000. Since you face a 20% discount each round, this is actually the best deal for both of us right now. If we wait, the total value decreases for you.",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the 20% discount I face each round, I'd like a slightly higher share to compensate for the loss in value over time. This way, we both still get a substantial amount.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I'm willing to adjust my initial offer to give you more value in real terms. With the 20% inflation you face, $4500 now is worth more than waiting another round where your discount increases. This is a fair compromise since we both need to reach an agreement soon.",Alice,3,

4200.0,5800.0,"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the offer, but I still think I deserve a bit more considering the rapidly decreasing value for me. This offer is closer to what I had in mind, and I hope we can settle on this.",Bob,4,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, we're now at round 5, and your discount has accumulated significantly. At this point, $4800 for you is worth much more than waiting further rounds. This offer is more generous to you than my previous one, and I think it's a fair balance that acknowledges your time pressure. Let's conclude this deal now before your discount increases further.",Alice,5,
