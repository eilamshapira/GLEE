""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a fair 50-50 split where we both get $5,000. Since you face a 20% discount each round, this is actually the best deal for both of us right now. If we wait, the total value decreases for you.""}"

This offer is more generous to you than my previous one, and I think it's a fair balance that acknowledges your time pressure. Let's conclude this deal now before your discount increases further.""}"
