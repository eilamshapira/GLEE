"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a fair 50-50 split where we both get $5000. Since you face a 20% discount each round, this is actually the best deal for both of us right now. If we wait, the total value decreases for you. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

""alice_gain"": 4000,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to adjust my initial offer to give you more value in real terms. With the 20% inflation you face, $4500 now is worth more than waiting another round where your discount increases. This is a fair compromise since we both need to reach an agreement soon.

# Alice gain: 5500

""alice_gain"": 4200,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're now at round 5, and your discount has accumulated significantly. At this point, $4800 for you is worth much more than waiting further rounds. This offer is more generous to you than my previous one, and I think it's a fair balance that acknowledges your time pressure. Let's conclude this deal now before your discount increases further. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
