60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since we both know the money loses 20% value for me each round, this is actually fair - if we go to the next round, I'd need a higher percentage just to match the same actual value. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good deal.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but since we can't verify each other's inflation rates, I propose a perfectly fair 50-50 split. This way we both get an equal share, and we can conclude the deal immediately without any further value loss on your end.",Bob,2,
