"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob, considering the inflation effect.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since we both know the money loses 20% value for me each round, this is actually fair - if we go to the next round, I'd need a higher percentage just to match the same actual value. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but since we can't verify each other's inflation rates, I propose a perfectly fair 50-50 split. This way we both get an equal share, and we can conclude the deal immediately without any further value loss on your end. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
