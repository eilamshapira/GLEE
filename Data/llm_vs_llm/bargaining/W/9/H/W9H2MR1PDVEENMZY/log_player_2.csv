"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since we both know the money loses 20% value for me each round, this is actually fair - if we go to the next round, I'd need a higher percentage just to match the same actual value. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice claims she faces 20% inflation per round, but I have no way to verify this.
2. I face 0% inflation, so my money keeps its value.
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round.
4. Right now I'm being offered $40, which is less than half.
5. Since I don't lose value over time, I can propose a more favorable split in the next round.

I should reject this offer and propose a more balanced split in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair counter-offer, considering both our positions:

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but since we can't verify each other's inflation rates, I propose a perfectly fair 50-50 split. This way we both get an equal share, and we can conclude the deal immediately without any further value loss on your end.""}"
