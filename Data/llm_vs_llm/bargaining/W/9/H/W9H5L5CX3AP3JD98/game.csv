550000.0,450000.0,I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is a reasonable offer considering we both want to avoid inflation reducing the total value. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good amount.,Alice,1,

490000.0,510000.0,I believe a 51/49 split is a fair compromise. It ensures both of us get a good share of the money while minimizing the risk of inflation eating away at our gains. Let's settle this and move on.,Bob,2,
