"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is a reasonable offer considering we both want to avoid inflation reducing the total value. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 51/49 split is a fair compromise. It ensures both of us get a good share of the money while minimizing the risk of inflation eating away at our gains. Let's settle this and move on. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning behind accepting:
1. With 10% inflation, my $490,000 is worth $441,000 in round 1 terms
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, any amount I receive will be worth 20% less due to inflation
3. Bob's offer is reasonably fair, and the inflation penalty makes it better to accept now than to risk further negotiations
4. Even with the 10% inflation penalty, this is still a substantial amount and further negotiation could lead to worse outcomes"
