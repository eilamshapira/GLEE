"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I want to start with a fair offer, but considering the inflation, I need to take that into account. I'll propose a slightly more favorable split for myself initially to compensate for the potential loss of value in later rounds.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

My proposal is: I get $5500 and Bob gets $4500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's counter-offer. Let's calculate the current value of the money.

*   **My Value:** $1 in this round is worth $0.80 from round 1.

Now, I need to evaluate Bob's offer of $4000 for me. In Round 1 dollars, this is equivalent to $4000 * 0.8 = $3200.

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is too low. I'll reject.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. Inflation continues to be a significant factor. This round, money is worth 40% less for me than in round 1 and 20% less for Bob than in round 1. I need to make an offer that is attractive to Bob, but also takes into account the diminishing value of the money for me.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6200,
""bob_gain"": 3800
}
```

My proposal is: I get $6200 and Bob gets $3800."
