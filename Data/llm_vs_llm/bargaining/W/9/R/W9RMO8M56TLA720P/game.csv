700000.0,300000.0,Let's split this fairly. I think this is a generous offer given the time limit!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
285700.0,714300.0,"Alice, I’m proposing the following split based on our respective discount factors. Since waiting reduces my dollar’s value by 10% each round and yours by 20%, as the proposer I can secure about 71.43% of the nominal amount while leaving you with about 28.57%. In round 2 that means I’d get $714300 (worth 0.9×$714300 ≈ $642870 in current value) and you would get $285700 (worth 0.8×$285700 ≈ $228560). This offer reflects the equilibrium of our alternating‐offer game given our different time sensitivities. I believe it is fair considering the cost of delay for each of us—please accept it so we can both avoid further inflationary losses.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I understand your reasoning, but I think my skills deserve more. This offer is still a good deal for you, considering the time limit. Let's finalize this.",Alice,3,
,,"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but waiting one more round will allow me, as the proposer, to secure a better deal despite further inflation reductions. I believe it’s in both our interests to hold out a bit longer.",Bob,3,reject
285700.0,714300.0,"Alice, based on our per‐round discount factors (my money losing 10% per round and yours 20%), the subgame perfect equilibrium division when I propose is exactly as follows: I keep 71.43% of the nominal amount and you receive 28.57%. Concretely, if you reject my offer today, you’d be in a proposer’s seat next round—but given your higher impatience, your expected nominal value would still be 285700. Accepting today avoids further losses from inflation for both of us. I believe this is the fair, equilibrium split. Please accept this offer so that we can finalize our agreement before additional value is lost.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I'm being reasonable. I'm sure we can both agree this is fair given the stakes. Let's finish it here.",Alice,5,
,,"Alice, thanks for your offer. However, given that in round 5 my dollars are now worth only about 65.61% of their original value while yours are worth 40.96%, your proposal gives me a present value of 450000 × 0.6561 ≈ 295245. If I reject and become the proposer in round 6, despite further discounting (my discount factor dropping to 0.59049), I can craft an offer that yields me a substantially higher present value. In view of the dynamics of our game and our differing discount rates, I must reject your current proposal in hopes of reaching a more balanced outcome in the next round.",Bob,5,reject
546875.0,453125.0,"Alice, based on our discounting structure and backward induction from round 12, if you reject my proposal in round 6, you would get to propose in round 7 and secure, in equilibrium, a nominal amount of 223840. When we account for the discount factors — in round 7 your dollars are worth 0.8⁶ while in round 6 they are worth 0.8⁵ — this continuation value translates into a round-6 present value of 546875 for you. To keep you indifferent between accepting now or waiting, I am offering you 546875 (and retaining 453125 for myself). This division reflects the unique trade-off of our different discount rates and ensures that neither of us can improve our outcome by further delay. I hope you agree that this is the fair and efficient resolution given the cost of waiting for both sides.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, the longer we wait, the worse it gets. This is my final, generous offer. Let's get this done.",Alice,7,
,,"Alice, while I appreciate your sentiment that further delay costs both of us, the current offer gives me a present value of about 480000 × 0.5314 ≈ 255072. If I reject, I’ll get to propose in round 8. With an estimated discount factor of around 0.478 for me (and about 0.210 for you), the standard equilibrium of our bargaining game implies that I could secure roughly 87.8% of the nominal amount in round 8—that is, about 878000 nominal dollars—which, with the further discounting, would be worth roughly 878000 × 0.478 ≈ 420000 in my present value. Comparing 255072 to 420000, it’s clear that waiting yields me a much higher payoff. Therefore, I must reject your offer in hopes of negotiating a better division in the next round.",Bob,7,reject
137760.0,862240.0,"Alice, as we move to round 8 our discount factors are now 0.9⁷ ≈ 0.4783 for me and 0.8⁷ ≈ 0.2097 for you. Using backward induction over the remaining rounds, if you reject my offer today you will be the proposer in round 9. In equilibrium that would allow you to secure a nominal share of about 172000 dollars in round 9, which—discounted at your round 9 factor of 0.8⁸ (≈0.1678)—yields roughly 28884 in current value. To make you indifferent between accepting today and waiting, I must offer you a nominal amount today that, when multiplied by your current discount factor (0.2097), equals that continuation value. That calculation gives about 137760 nominal dollars for you (because 137760 × 0.2097 ≈ 28884). Accordingly, I will keep 1000000 − 137760 = 862240 nominal dollars. This division represents the fair, equilibrium split given both our time preferences and ensures that neither side has an incentive to delay further. I hope you agree to this proposal so we can avoid more loss in value.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
150000.0,850000.0,"Bob, I know we're running out of time and I'm trying to be fair. Take this and let's move on.",Alice,9,
,,"Alice, thank you for your offer. However, under your proposal I’d receive a nominal 850000, which—after applying the current discount factor for me (approximately 0.4305)—yields a present‐value payoff of about 365925. If I reject your offer in round 9, I become the proposer in round 10, where I can structure a proposal that exploits our asymmetric discounting. In round 10, my discount factor will drop a bit (roughly to 0.3875), but yours will drop even more (around 0.1342), meaning that in equilibrium I can secure a significantly larger nominal share while only giving you the minimum you’d require to be indifferent. In short, waiting allows me a better outcome than accepting your current offer. For that reason, I must reject your proposal and look forward to making my offer in round 10.",Bob,9,reject
80000.0,920000.0,"Alice, here’s my proposal for round 10. As you know, our money loses value each round: in round 10 my dollars are worth about 0.9⁹ ≈ 0.3874 of their initial value, while yours are worth roughly 0.8⁹ ≈ 0.1342. If you reject my offer, you become the proposer in round 11. In that scenario, by backward induction you would secure almost all of the pie—though to keep me indifferent you’d have to offer me nearly nothing, leaving you with around 100000 nominal dollars. However, because your discount factor in round 11 is about 0.8¹⁰ ≈ 0.1074, that 100000 nominal translates to a present‐value of roughly 10740. To ensure you are indifferent between accepting now and waiting, your share in round 10 must provide the same present value. That means I need to offer you an amount y such that y × 0.1342 ≈ 10740; solving this gives y ≈ 80000 nominal dollars. Accordingly, I will keep 1000000 − 80000 = 920000 nominal dollars. This is the fair equilibrium division for round 10 given our discount factors and the continuation values. I hope you understand that accepting this offer spares us both further losses and is the best move under these circumstances.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
90000.0,910000.0,"Bob, take it or leave it. This is the last round. Let's finish.",Alice,11,
,,"Alice, since rejecting would leave us both with nothing in the final round, I accept your offer. Even though the nominal amounts are discounted, getting 910000 nominal dollars now is far better than risking losing it all. Let's finalize the agreement.",Bob,11,accept
