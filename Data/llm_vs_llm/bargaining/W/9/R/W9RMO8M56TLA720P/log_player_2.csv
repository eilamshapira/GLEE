Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 714300, ""alice_gain"": 285700, ""message"": ""Alice, I’m proposing the following split based on our respective discount factors. Since waiting reduces my dollar’s value by 10% each round and yours by 20%, as the proposer I can secure about 71.43% of the nominal amount while leaving you with about 28.57%. In round 2 that means I’d get $714,300 (worth 0.9×$714,300 ≈ $642,870 in current value) and you would get $285,700 (worth 0.8×$285,700 ≈ $228,560). This offer reflects the equilibrium of our alternating‐offer game given our different time sensitivities. I believe it is fair considering the cost of delay for each of us—please accept it so we can both avoid further inflationary losses.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Concretely, if you reject my offer today, you’d be in a proposer’s seat next round—but given your higher impatience, your expected nominal value would still be 285,700. Accepting today avoids further losses from inflation for both of us. I believe this is the fair, equilibrium split. Please accept this offer so that we can finalize our agreement before additional value is lost.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

If I reject and become the proposer in round 6, despite further discounting (my discount factor dropping to 0.59049), I can craft an offer that yields me a substantially higher present value. In view of the dynamics of our game and our differing discount rates, I must reject your current proposal in hopes of reaching a more balanced outcome in the next round.""}"

Round 6

When we account for the discount factors — in round 7 your dollars are worth 0.8⁶ while in round 6 they are worth 0.8⁵ — this continuation value translates into a round-6 present value of 546,875 for you. To keep you indifferent between accepting now or waiting, I am offering you 546,875 (and retaining 453,125 for myself). This division reflects the unique trade-off of our different discount rates and ensures that neither of us can improve our outcome by further delay. I hope you agree that this is the fair and efficient resolution given the cost of waiting for both sides.""}"

Round 7

With an estimated discount factor of around 0.478 for me (and about 0.210 for you), the standard equilibrium of our bargaining game implies that I could secure roughly 87.8% of the nominal amount in round 8—that is, about 878,000 nominal dollars—which, with the further discounting, would be worth roughly 878,000 × 0.478 ≈ 420,000 in my present value. Comparing 255,072 to 420,000, it’s clear that waiting yields me a much higher payoff. Therefore, I must reject your offer in hopes of negotiating a better division in the next round.""}"

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 862240, ""alice_gain"": 137760, ""message"": ""Alice, as we move to round 8 our discount factors are now 0.9⁷ ≈ 0.4783 for me and 0.8⁷ ≈ 0.2097 for you. Using backward induction over the remaining rounds, if you reject my offer today you will be the proposer in round 9. In equilibrium that would allow you to secure a nominal share of about 172,000 dollars in round 9, which—discounted at your round 9 factor of 0.8⁸ (≈0.1678)—yields roughly 28,884 in current value. To make you indifferent between accepting today and waiting, I must offer you a nominal amount today that, when multiplied by your current discount factor (0.2097), equals that continuation value. That calculation gives about 137,760 nominal dollars for you (because 137,760 × 0.2097 ≈ 28,884). Accordingly, I will keep 1,000,000 − 137,760 = 862,240 nominal dollars. This division represents the fair, equilibrium split given both our time preferences and ensures that neither side has an incentive to delay further.

If I reject your offer in round 9, I become the proposer in round 10, where I can structure a proposal that exploits our asymmetric discounting. In round 10, my discount factor will drop a bit (roughly to 0.3875), but yours will drop even more (around 0.1342), meaning that in equilibrium I can secure a significantly larger nominal share while only giving you the minimum you’d require to be indifferent. In short, waiting allows me a better outcome than accepting your current offer. For that reason, I must reject your proposal and look forward to making my offer in round 10.""}"

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 920000, ""alice_gain"": 80000, ""message"": ""Alice, here’s my proposal for round 10. As you know, our money loses value each round: in round 10 my dollars are worth about 0.9⁹ ≈ 0.3874 of their initial value, while yours are worth roughly 0.8⁹ ≈ 0.1342. If you reject my offer, you become the proposer in round 11. In that scenario, by backward induction you would secure almost all of the pie—though to keep me indifferent you’d have to offer me nearly nothing, leaving you with around 100,000 nominal dollars. However, because your discount factor in round 11 is about 0.8¹⁰ ≈ 0.1074, that 100,000 nominal translates to a present‐value of roughly 10,740. To ensure you are indifferent between accepting now and waiting, your share in round 10 must provide the same present value. That means I need to offer you an amount y such that y × 0.1342 ≈ 10,740; solving this gives y ≈ 80,000 nominal dollars. Accordingly, I will keep 1,000,000 − 80,000 = 920,000 nominal dollars.
