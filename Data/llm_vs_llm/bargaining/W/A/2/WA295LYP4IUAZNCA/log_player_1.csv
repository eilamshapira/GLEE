"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor. This way we both get a good portion, and we can avoid inflation eating into our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, I get a bit more, but you still receive a fair share. Let's avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
* If I accept now, I'll get $45, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $40.5
* If I reject and we go to another round, any amount will be worth even less due to increasing inflation
* My previous offer of $60 was rejected, and this counter-offer isn't too far from a fair split
* Further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes for both of us due to inflation
