"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor.  While I understand your desire to maximize your share, this offer still gives you a significant portion of the money and allows us to avoid further inflation losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since even with the 10% inflation penalty, I can still try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. A 45% share when I initially proposed 60% is too large of a drop."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
