Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. This 55-45 split in my favor is a fair compromise between our previous offers, and it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now before inflation further reduces the value for me. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
