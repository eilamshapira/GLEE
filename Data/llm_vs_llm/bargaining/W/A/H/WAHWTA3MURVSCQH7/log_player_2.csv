"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about I take 60 and you take 40? It's a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less next round
4. $40 now is better than a higher nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation
5. 60-40 split isn't terrible for a first offer

While I could try to negotiate for more, the 5% inflation penalty makes immediate acceptance more attractive. $40 now is better than risking a prolonged negotiation where the value keeps decreasing.
