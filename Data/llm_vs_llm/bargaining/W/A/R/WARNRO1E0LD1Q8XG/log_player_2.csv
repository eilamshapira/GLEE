"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose to split the money with a 60-40 ratio in my favor. This ensures we both get a substantial amount, and it's a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's proposal carefully. She's suggesting I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000. While I could potentially negotiate for more in the next round, $400,000 is still a substantial amount, and there's always risk in continuing negotiations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe an equal 50-50 split would be the fairest approach. We would both walk away with a significant amount of $500,000 each. This represents a balanced outcome that respects both our positions in this negotiation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob. Let's meet in the middle. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a fair share, and it's a step closer to your proposal. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's new proposal. She's now offering me $450,000 while she would get $550,000. This is a more balanced offer than her initial 60-40 split, and she's moved significantly toward my proposed even split. While I could try to negotiate further, $450,000 is a substantial amount, and continued negotiation always carries some risk.
