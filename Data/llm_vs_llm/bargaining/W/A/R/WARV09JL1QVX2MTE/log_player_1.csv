"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1, keeping in mind the inflation I'm facing:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm asking for a slightly larger share to compensate for the impending inflation hitting me. This hopefully seems reasonable to Bob, leading to a quick acceptance and avoiding further loss of value for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **Bob's offer:** $5000 for me, $5000 for him.
*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 10% less, Bob's is worth 20% less.

This means my $5000 is effectively worth $4500 (5000 * 0.9). Bob's $5000 is effectively worth $4000 (5000 * 0.8).

If I reject, the next round will have even worse inflation. Therefore, I will accept this offer, as it is likely the best I can achieve under these conditions.
