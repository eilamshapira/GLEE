"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, waiting costs us bothâ€”in my offer today, you receive $643000 and I $357000. This split reflects your bargaining strength if you were to propose in the next round (with less overall value given the slower discount for you) while sparing us further devaluation. I believe this is the fair, efficient resolution for both of us. Please accept. 
# Alice gain: 643000 
# Bob gain: 357000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
