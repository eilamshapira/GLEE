"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair offer. We both get something, and it's a good starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 357000, ""alice_gain"": 643000, ""message"": ""Alice, waiting costs us bothâ€”in my offer today, you receive $643,000 and I $357,000. This split reflects your bargaining strength if you were to propose in the next round (with less overall value given the slower discount for you) while sparing us further devaluation. I believe this is the fair, efficient resolution for both of us. Please accept.""}"
