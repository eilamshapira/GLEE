"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer. Alice is proposing that out of the $10,000, I would get $4,000 while she would get $6,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money would be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. That means the $10,000 would effectively be worth $8,000 to me in the next round.

Given that the money is already worth 100% of its value now, and I'm being offered 40% of the total, I should carefully evaluate whether I can realistically get more than $4,000 in the next round after accounting for inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for the inflation effect while trying to achieve a more favorable split for myself.

Since the money is now worth 20% less to me due to inflation, I need to be strategic. I'll aim for a fair division that acknowledges Alice's position but improves my outcome.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split that divides the money equally between us. This is a fair proposition that gives both of us an equal share of the available funds."
