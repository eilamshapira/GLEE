"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. But the 20% inflation penalty means if I reject, my eventual gain will be worth 20% less
4. If I accept now, I get $5000 at full value
5. If I reject and get even $6000 next round, it would only be worth $4800 after inflation

Given these factors, especially the significant inflation penalty, I should accept this fair offer now rather than risk getting less value in future rounds.
