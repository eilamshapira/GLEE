"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm thinking a fair split can be me getting $4750 and you getting $5250 since you have the advantage of no decreasing value over rounds. Let's seal the deal! 
# Bob gain: 5250 
# Alice gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice is offering me $5250 and herself $4750, which is a slightly better deal for me, I'll consider it. Given that the money's value decreases for Alice over rounds, it's likely she'll make less favorable offers as the game progresses.
