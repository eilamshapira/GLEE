"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's aim for a slightly better split for me, considering the potential inflation impact on my side. This still gives you a substantial portion and ensures we reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
