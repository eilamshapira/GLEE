60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob! I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. Since we face 10% inflation each round, delaying will reduce the total value for me. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good amount rather than risk diminishing returns.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. Inflation is hurting both of us. I'm offering a 55/45 split. That's a fair deal for everyone.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I see that we're both trying to get more than half. Let's meet in the middle - I'm offering you 45 and I'll take 55. This is fair considering the inflation is affecting me more (10% per round) than you (5% per round). If we keep going, we both lose more value. Let's agree now.",Alice,3,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but my counter-offer is 60/40 in my favor. The inflation rate is higher for you, so it makes sense.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
53.0,47.0,"Bob, I'm moving closer to a middle ground. The inflation is really hurting me more than you (I'm at 30% total loss vs your 15%). We need to reach an agreement soon or we'll both lose significantly more value. This 53/47 split acknowledges both our positions. Please accept so we can both walk away with a good outcome before inflation erodes our gains further.",Alice,5,

35.0,65.0,"Alice, it seems we're both stubborn. Inflation continues to eat away at our potential gains, especially yours. To account for this, I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor. This reflects the diminishing value and the fact that you're losing value faster. Accept this, and we both get something worthwhile.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, we're now 7 rounds in and inflation has significantly reduced our potential gains. I'm losing almost 45% to inflation while you're losing about 25%. Let's stop this back-and-forth and agree to a perfectly even 50/50 split. This is the fairest solution at this point, and further delays will only hurt us both more. If we continue this pattern, we risk getting nothing in the end.",Alice,7,
