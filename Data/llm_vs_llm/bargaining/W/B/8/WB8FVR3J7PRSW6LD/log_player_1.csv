"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a first offer to Bob, considering the inflation effect on future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. Since we face 10% inflation each round, delaying will reduce the total value for me. Let's agree now and both walk away with a good amount rather than risk diminishing returns.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. Inflation is hurting both of us. I'm offering a 55/45 split. That's a fair deal for everyone. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, I see that we're both trying to get more than half. Let's meet in the middle - I'm offering you 45 and I'll take 55. This is fair considering the inflation is affecting me more (10% per round) than you (5% per round). If we keep going, we both lose more value. Let's agree now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but my counter-offer is 60/40 in my favor. The inflation rate is higher for you, so it makes sense. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 53,
""bob_gain"": 47,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm moving closer to a middle ground. The inflation is really hurting me more than you (I'm at 30% total loss vs your 15%). We need to reach an agreement soon or we'll both lose significantly more value. This 53/47 split acknowledges both our positions. Please accept so we can both walk away with a good outcome before inflation erodes our gains further.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems we're both stubborn. Inflation continues to eat away at our potential gains, especially yours. To account for this, I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor. This reflects the diminishing value and the fact that you're losing value faster. Accept this, and we both get something worthwhile. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, we're now 7 rounds in and inflation has significantly reduced our potential gains. I'm losing almost 45% to inflation while you're losing about 25%. Let's stop this back-and-forth and agree to a perfectly even 50/50 split. This is the fairest solution at this point, and further delays will only hurt us both more. If we continue this pattern, we risk getting nothing in the end.""}"
