"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! Let's keep it simple and fair. I propose we split the $100 equally. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

This is a fair 50-50 split, which is generally considered equitable. However, I need to consider that if I reject and move to the next round:
1. The money will be worth 20% less due to inflation
2. I'll get to make the next proposal
3. I don't know how inflation affects Alice

With 20% inflation, if I reject, the $100 will effectively be worth $80 in the next round. Even if I proposed to take most of it then, I'd be working with a smaller total amount.

A guaranteed $50 now is better than the risk of getting less value in the next round due to inflation.
