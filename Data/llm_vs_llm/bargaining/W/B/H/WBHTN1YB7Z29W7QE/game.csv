6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair considering that money depreciates faster for you (10%) than for me (5%) in future rounds, so accepting now maximizes our combined value.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Considering the depreciation rates, I believe a 55/45 split in my favor is more reasonable, as it accounts for the faster decrease in value for me in future rounds.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's reach a fair agreement. I'm now proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, which is more balanced than my initial offer. We're both losing value with each round - you're now at 81% of original value, I'm at 90.25%. If we continue, we both lose more. This is a reasonable compromise.",Alice,3,
