"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my first offer and message to Bob.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair considering that money depreciates faster for you (10%) than for me (5%) in future rounds, so accepting now maximizes our combined value.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the depreciation rates, I believe a 55/45 split in my favor is more reasonable, as it accounts for the faster decrease in value for me in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer for round 3.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Bob, let's reach a fair agreement. I'm now proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, which is more balanced than my initial offer. We're both losing value with each round - you're now at 81% of original value, I'm at 90.25%. If we continue, we both lose more. This is a reasonable compromise.""
