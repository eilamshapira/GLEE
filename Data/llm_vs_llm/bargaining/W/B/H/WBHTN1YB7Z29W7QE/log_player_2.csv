"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair considering that money depreciates faster for you (10%) than for me (5%) in future rounds, so accepting now maximizes our combined value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice after each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

The total value after the first round for me would be $10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000, and for Alice, it would be $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500.

Considering this, I'll make a proposal that is more favorable to me than Alice's initial offer.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Considering the depreciation rates, I believe a 55/45 split in my favor is more reasonable, as it accounts for the faster decrease in value for me in future rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's reach a fair agreement. I'm now proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, which is more balanced than my initial offer. We're both losing value with each round - you're now at 81% of original value, I'm at 90.25%. If we continue, we both lose more. This is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
