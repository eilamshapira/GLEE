Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. This way, we both get a good share and can end the game quickly before inflation affects us too much.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, how about we split it evenly at 50-50? This way, we both leave with a fair share before inflation reduces the value further. What do you think?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, since we're now in round 3 and the value of money is decreasing for me, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation effect. Let's end this soon! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
