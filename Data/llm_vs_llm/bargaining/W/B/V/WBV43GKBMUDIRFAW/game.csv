4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, considering the inflation effect on my side, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. I'd appreciate it if you could understand my position here.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your updated proposal. However, given that my share remains undiscounted and I anticipate being able to propose a more favorable division in the next round, I must decline this offer. Let's continue the negotiation.",Alice,2,reject
5300.0,4700.0,"Hi Bob, I know that with each round the delay costs you more as inflation takes its toll. In round 3, your $4700 is effectively worth about 60% of its nominal value—roughly $2820 in today’s terms. Given that if you wait until round 4 your effective share will likely drop even further, I believe this split is a smart compromise. I get $5300 and you get $4700, ensuring you’re better off accepting now rather than facing additional devaluation. Let’s settle this before the discount deepens.",Alice,3,
