"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's start with a fair division by splitting the $10,000 equally: $5,000 each. I believe this is a good balanced starting point for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation effect on my side, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. I'd appreciate it if you could understand my position here. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your updated proposal. However, given that my share remains undiscounted and I anticipate being able to propose a more favorable division in the next round, I must decline this offer. Let's continue the negotiation.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5300, ""bob_gain"": 4700, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I know that with each round the delay costs you more as inflation takes its toll. In round 3, your $4,700 is effectively worth about 60% of its nominal value—roughly $2,820 in today’s terms. Given that if you wait until round 4 your effective share will likely drop even further, I believe this split is a smart compromise. I get $5,300 and you get $4,700, ensuring you’re better off accepting now rather than facing additional devaluation. Let’s settle this before the discount deepens.""}"
