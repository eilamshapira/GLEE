"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair division by splitting the $10000 equally: $5000 each. I believe this is a good balanced starting point for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the inflation effect on my side, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. I'd appreciate it if you could understand my position here.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I know that with each round the delay costs you more as inflation takes its toll. In round 3, your $4700 is effectively worth about 60% of its nominal value—roughly $2820 in today’s terms. Given that if you wait until round 4 your effective share will likely drop even further, I believe this split is a smart compromise. I get $5300 and you get $4700, ensuring you’re better off accepting now rather than facing additional devaluation. Let’s settle this before the discount deepens. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300
