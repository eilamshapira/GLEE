"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2857.14 
# Alice gain: 7142.86 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is quite favorable for her, giving her over 70% of the total amount. Given that inflation affects me more heavily (20% per round) than it affects Alice (10% per round), there's some pressure to reach an agreement. However, I think a more equitable distribution is possible, and I can make a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, taking into account our different inflation rates but still seeking a fair division.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose we split the money evenly, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests, and given our different inflation penalties, it makes sense to reach an agreement quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6666.67 
# Alice gain: 3333.33 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's new offer is much more favorable to me, giving me about two-thirds of the total amount. Even with the 36% inflation penalty I'm facing, this is a good deal for me. The $6,666.67 with 36% inflation is still worth more than $4,266.67, which is better than most equal splits would be after inflation.
