60.0,40.0,I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering future discounting.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
44.0,56.0,"Okay, let's try this again. Considering the 5% inflation on my end, this offer gives you slightly more than what you proposed initially and still leaves me with a decent amount. How about it?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Due to the 10% total inflation on your side over these three rounds, this $35 is worth about $31.5 to you now. I'm being fair by offering you this amount rather than waiting for further depreciation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
52.0,48.0,"Alright, let's be reasonable. I'm going to offer a slightly better split. If we don't agree now, the money becomes worth even less for me.  Let's end this and each of us walk away with something.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
