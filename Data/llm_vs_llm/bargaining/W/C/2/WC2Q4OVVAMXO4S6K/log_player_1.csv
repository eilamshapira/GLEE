"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering future discounting.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, let's try this again. Considering the 5% inflation on my end, this offer gives you slightly more than what you proposed initially and still leaves me with a decent amount. How about it? 
# Alice gain: 44 
# Bob gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob offers me $44 and takes $56
2. For Bob, due to 5% inflation, his $56 is actually worth $53.2 in round 1 terms
3. My previous offer was $60 for me, $40 for Bob
4. Bob's offer gives me less than what I proposed ($44 vs $60)
5. I can make another counter-offer next round, but Bob's money will be worth even less then

Since $44 is significantly lower than what I proposed ($60), and I know Bob's position weakens in future rounds due to inflation, I should reject and make a better counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Due to the 10% total inflation on your side over these three rounds, this $35 is worth about $31.5 to you now. I'm being fair by offering you this amount rather than waiting for further depreciation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alright, let's be reasonable. I'm going to offer a slightly better split. If we don't agree now, the money becomes worth even less for me.  Let's end this and each of us walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob offers me $52 and takes $48
2. For Bob, due to 14.26% inflation, his $48 is actually worth about $41.2 in round 1 terms
3. My last offer was $65 for me, $35 for Bob
4. This offer ($52) is better than Bob's previous offer ($44)
5. If I reject, Bob's money will be worth even less next round, but we risk prolonging the game

Given that:
- The offer is significantly better than Bob's last offer
- It's closer to a fair split considering the inflation effect
- Further rounds might lead to more antagonistic negotiations
- $52 is a reasonable compromise between my initial $60 request and Bob's previous offers
