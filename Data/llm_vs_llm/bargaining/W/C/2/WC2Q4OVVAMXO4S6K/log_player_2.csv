Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Due to the 10% total inflation on your side over these three rounds, this $35 is worth about $31.5 to you now. I'm being fair by offering you this amount rather than waiting for further depreciation. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65
