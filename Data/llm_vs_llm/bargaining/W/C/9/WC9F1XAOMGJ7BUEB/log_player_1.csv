Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose we split the remaining $10000 equally at $5000 each. This way, we both benefit fairly before my share diminishes further. Let's settle now to avoid further losses on my end.

Waiting another round will only worsen your position due to further inflation on your share. I'm aiming for an agreement that avoids additional loss for you, so please consider settling now.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, given the rapid decrease in the value of my share due to inflation, I propose I get $6000 and you get $4000. This offer reflects a fair compromise considering my share is now worth only 51.2% of its original value. Let's agree on this to prevent further erosion of my effective gain.

Even though your share is depreciating further, agreeing now doesn’t fully reflect the gains available to each of us before additional rounds set in. I propose we hold off on settling today. Let's move to the next round and work out a division that better accounts for the future shifts in value.""}"

Keep in mind that by now your money is worth only about 41% (0.8⁴) of its nominal value – your $2500 is effectively around $1025. If we delay any further, your share will be subject to even steeper inflation and its effective value will drop further, while my share remains fully intact. Given that if you wait to be the proposer in later rounds you’d have to offer me practically everything to get my agreement, this deal improves your situation compared to waiting. Let's settle now before the gap widens further.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, with my share now worth only about 33.28% of its original value due to inflation, I propose I get $7000 and you get $3000. This is a fair compromise considering the significant impact of inflation on my side. Let's settle now to avoid further devaluation of my effective gain.

However, the division of $3000 for me and $7000 for you doesn't align with the balance we need given that my share holds its full value while your share is rapidly depleting. I believe that waiting another round will allow us to negotiate a division that better accounts for the inflational differences.

This matches your expected value if you were to wait until Round 8, where you'd be the proposer. Accepting now secures that effective value for you without further delay or loss.

However, your proposal gives me only $2000 while leaving you with $8000—translated into effective values, your share would be worth around $1,678. I believe that if we continue to the next round, when I would have the initiative, I can propose a division that will leave you with a higher effective value compared to what you'd get if we settle now. In other words, waiting another round could improve both our positions given the structure of inflation. Let's proceed to Round 9 and work towards a more balanced outcome.""}"

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 2000, ""bob_gain"": 8000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in Round 9 your money is now worth only about 16.78% of its nominal value (since 0.8^8 ≈ 0.1678). This means that if you wait until Round 10 to propose, even if you were to claim almost the entire $10,000, your effective gain would be around $10,000 × 0.1342 ≈ $1342. To ensure you secure at least that value now, I propose that you receive $8000 (which effectively is worth about $1342 at this discount), and I take $2000 (which retains its full value).
