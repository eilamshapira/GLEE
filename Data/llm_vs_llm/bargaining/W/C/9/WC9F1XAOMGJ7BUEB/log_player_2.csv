Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I get $7378.56 and you get $2621.44. If we delay further, your share will be reduced by 20% per round. Accepting now guarantees you $2621.44 in full value, so let's settle immediately and avoid any losses.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 3: I get $3750 and you get $6250. Remember that your money is discounted by 36% at this stage (0.8² = 0.64 of its nominal value), so by accepting now you secure an effective value of about $4000. Waiting another round will only worsen your position due to further inflation on your share. I'm aiming for an agreement that avoids additional loss for you, so please consider settling now. 
# Bob gain: 6250 
# Alice gain: 3750

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my Round 5 proposal: I take $7500 and you get $2500. Keep in mind that by now your money is worth only about 41% (0.8⁴) of its nominal value – your $2500 is effectively around $1025. If we delay any further, your share will be subject to even steeper inflation and its effective value will drop further, while my share remains fully intact. Given that if you wait to be the proposer in later rounds you’d have to offer me practically everything to get my agreement, this deal improves your situation compared to waiting. Let's settle now before the gap widens further. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, for Round 7 I propose the following division: I take $4879 and you get $5121. At this stage your money is discounted by 0.8^6 (about 26.2% of its nominal value), meaning your $5121 is effectively worth around $1342. This matches your expected value if you were to wait until Round 8, where you'd be the proposer. Accepting now secures that effective value for you without further delay or loss. Let's settle this round and avoid the accelerating depreciation of your share. 
# Bob gain: 5121 
# Alice gain: 4879

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in Round 9 your money is now worth only about 16.78% of its nominal value (since 0.8^8 ≈ 0.1678). This means that if you wait until Round 10 to propose, even if you were to claim almost the entire $10000, your effective gain would be around $10000 × 0.1342 ≈ $1342. To ensure you secure at least that value now, I propose that you receive $8000 (which effectively is worth about $1342 at this discount), and I take $2000 (which retains its full value). Accepting this offer now avoids further losses from inflation on your share while giving you what you'd expect next round. 
# Bob gain: 8000 
# Alice gain: 2000
