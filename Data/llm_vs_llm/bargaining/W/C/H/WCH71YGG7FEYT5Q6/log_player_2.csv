"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total. While this isn't an even split, it's a substantial amount of money.

Given that:
1. There's no inflation for me, so waiting doesn't cost me anything financially
2. I have the option to make a counter-offer in the next round
3. We still have 11 more potential rounds to negotiate
4. I don't know how inflation affects Alice (it might pressure her to accept a better offer later)

I think I can propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while still acknowledging Alice's initial position.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money, which gives us both an equal share of $500,000. This is a straightforward and equitable division that benefits us both substantially."
