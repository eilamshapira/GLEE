"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In this first round, I'll propose a fair and mutually beneficial division.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering an equal split of the million dollars - $500,000 for each of us. This is fair and avoids the risk of declining offers, which would reduce the total value due to the 10% inflation penalty each round."
