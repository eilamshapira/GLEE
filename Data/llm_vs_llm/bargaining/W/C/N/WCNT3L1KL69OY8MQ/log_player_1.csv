"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the 20% inflation penalty I face in future rounds. Since Bob doesn't face inflation, he might be more willing to wait, so I need to make a compelling first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this division because it's a favorable but not overly greedy split. If Bob rejects this, in the next round the money will be worth 20% less to me, so I need to secure a good portion now while maintaining fairness to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept, I get $400,000, but due to 20% inflation, it's only worth $320,000 to me
- If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, any amount I get will be worth 40% less
- For example, even if I managed to get $600,000 in round 3, it would only be worth $360,000 to me
- The inflation penalty severely impacts my negotiating position

Given these factors, I should accept Bob's offer. Even though it's less than my initial proposal, due to inflation, trying to negotiate further would likely leave me worse off.
