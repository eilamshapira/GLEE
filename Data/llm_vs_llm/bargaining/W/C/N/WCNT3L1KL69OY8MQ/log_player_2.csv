"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $400,000, Alice gets $600,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. For Alice, the money will be worth 20% less next round
4. This means $600,000 now is equivalent to $480,000 for her next round
5. I could offer her less in the next round and she might still accept
6. I can likely get a better deal by rejecting

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice faces a 20% depreciation each round, I can use this to my advantage. If I offer her $500,000 now, it's better for her than getting $600,000 in the next round (which would be worth only $400,000 to her after depreciation).

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

This is a fair offer because:
1. It's better for Alice to accept $400,000 now than to reject and face 20% depreciation
2. If she rejects, her counter-offer would be worth less to her
3. I get a better deal than her initial offer while still giving her a significant portion"
