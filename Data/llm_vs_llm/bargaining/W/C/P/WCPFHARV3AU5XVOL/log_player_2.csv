"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I'd like to propose a more balanced distribution. Alice, I think a 60-40 split in my favor would be fair considering the inflation penalty I face with each round. This gives you a substantial portion while recognizing that delays affect me more significantly due to the 10% inflation I experience per round. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits us both."
