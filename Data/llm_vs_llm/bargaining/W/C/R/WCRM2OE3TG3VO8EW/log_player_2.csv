"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money. I propose I get $55 and you get $45. This is a fair split given the circumstances, and it's better to take something now than risk further losses due to inflation. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is hurting us both. I propose a 50/50 split. It's fair, simple, and we both walk away with something. Let's end this now before we lose more money. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
