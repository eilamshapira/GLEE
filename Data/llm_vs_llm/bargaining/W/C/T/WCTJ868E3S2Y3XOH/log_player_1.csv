"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about a 45/55 split? I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's offer is not as favorable to me as my initial offer, and considering the inflation that affects Bob's gain, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 45/55 split in his favor, and considering the inflation that affects his gain, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly more in my favor. Also, I'll remind him that the inflation will keep reducing the value of his share.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Inflation is eating into your share, let's settle before it's too late""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. How about a 40/60 split? 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation has already reduced the value of Bob's share by 14.26%, and he's now offering a 40/60 split in my favor, which is more reasonable, I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
