"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with an equal split. 500k each seems fair. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether to accept or reject Alice's offer of a 50-50 split.

Given that inflation affects me (Bob) at 10% per round, but doesn't affect Alice, I should factor this into my decision. If I reject and we go to another round, the total value will be worth 10% less to me.

If I accept now: I get $500,000
If I reject and make an offer next round: The total $1,000,000 is worth only $900,000 to me due to inflation. Even if I propose taking all of it (which Alice would likely reject), the maximum value to me would be $900,000.

Since the equal split now gives me certain value without inflation penalty, I'll accept.
