"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that Bob's money loses value faster than mine with each round (20% vs 10% loss). This is a fair offer that gives Bob a significant portion while acknowledging my slightly stronger position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because even with the inflation impact, I can still aim for a better split. While my money will be worth 10% less next round, Bob's portion will depreciate even faster at 20%. This asymmetric inflation gives me a strategic advantage in later rounds, so I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42}

I'm slightly lowering my initial demand to show willingness to compromise, but still maintaining a favorable split given my inflation advantage. With Bob facing 20% depreciation per round compared to my 10%, this offer should be more appealing to him now, as waiting longer will hurt his position more than mine."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 43 
# Bob gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because even though inflation is reducing the value for both of us, Bob's portion is still losing value faster than mine. At this point, Bob's 57% is worth significantly less due to his 48.8% inflation compared to my 27.1% inflation. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that takes into account our respective inflation rates, aiming for a more favorable split for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm further lowering my demand to 55% to show additional willingness to compromise. At this point, inflation has significantly impacted both of our potential gains (my money is worth ~30% less and Bob's is worth ~50% less than round 1). This offer gives Bob a better absolute share while still recognizing my advantageous position regarding inflation rates. It's becoming increasingly important to reach an agreement before the money loses too much value for both of us."
