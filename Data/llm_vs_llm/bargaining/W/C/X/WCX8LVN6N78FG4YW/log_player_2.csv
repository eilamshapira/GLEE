"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $4000, Alice gets $6000
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But the money will be worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice
   * This means the $10,000 total will effectively be worth $9,000 to me and $8,000 to Alice

Since I can make the next offer and Alice will face a bigger depreciation than me, I think I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer. Alice will be more inclined to accept a better offer for me in the next round due to the steeper depreciation she faces.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is now worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice, I'll make a strategic offer:

I know that for Alice, the $10,000 is now only worth $8,000 in terms of her perceived value. If she rejects my offer, in the next round it will be worth even less to her (another 20% drop). This gives me some leverage.

I'll propose a split that gives me a bit more than the original offer, but still leaves Alice with enough that she should rationally accept rather than risk another round of depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because:
1. It's better for me than the original offer
2. For Alice, getting $4500 now is better than risking another 20% depreciation in the next round
3. It's still a reasonable offer that doesn't appear greedy"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Current offer: $4500 for me, which due to 19% inflation is actually worth $3,645 to me
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * Money will be worth 28% less to me and 48% less to Alice
   * Alice's position is getting significantly weaker due to higher depreciation

However, the depreciation is starting to significantly affect my potential gains too. If I reject, any future gains will be worth much less to both of us, and we risk entering a lose-lose situation where we both end up with much less value.

Given that this offer is better than Alice's first offer, and considering the accelerating depreciation, I think it's wise to accept now rather than risk further value loss.
