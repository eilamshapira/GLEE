"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that's fair while considering the inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest we divide the $100 with me taking $55 and you getting $45. This is a reasonable split considering that your inflation rate (10%) is higher than mine (5%), so reaching an agreement sooner is more valuable to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
