"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering inflation hits you harder, I propose 55/45 in my favor to balance it out. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the original amount was $10,000 and the money I gain is worth 20% less, the actual value I'd get from $4500 would be $4500 * 0.8 = $3600.

I'm not sure if this is the best deal for me, but I also don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation in the next rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the original $10,000 is now worth less to both of us. For me, it's worth 20% less in each round, so for Round 3, the value would be:
$10,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $10,000 * 0.64 = $6,400

For Bob, it's worth 10% less in each round, so for Round 3, the value would be:
$10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $10,000 * 0.81 = $8,100

I'll make an offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's aim for a more even split""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the increasing impact of inflation on both of us, I suggest a 52/48 split in my favor to reflect the urgency to settle. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value I'd get from Bob's offer, considering the inflation.

The original amount was $10,000, and the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, which means it's worth 51.2% of the original value. So, the actual value I'd get from $4800 would be:
$4800 * 0.512 = $2457.6

On the other hand, if I reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, the value of the money I gain would decrease even further due to inflation.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is not ideal, but it might be better than risking further inflation.
