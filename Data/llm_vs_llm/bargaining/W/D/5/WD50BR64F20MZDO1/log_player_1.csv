Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This offer is worse than my original offer, but continuing is too risky. The value of the money is going down for me, and I have no guarantee that Bob will offer me anything better in future rounds. It's better to take a less-than-ideal deal now than risk getting even less later."
