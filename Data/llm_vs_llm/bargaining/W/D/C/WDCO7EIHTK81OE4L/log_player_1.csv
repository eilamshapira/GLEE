"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to Bob. Given that there's a 5% inflation with each round for me, I need to balance fairness with the cost of delay.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging that delays would cost me more due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Bob's offer given the inflation effects.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, I'll face another 5% inflation (money would be worth 10% less than round 1 for me). Meanwhile, Bob's inflation is at 10% per round.

Bob has offered me $55, which after the current 5% inflation is equivalent to $52.25 in round 1 value for me. If I reject and we move to round 3, even if I got $60, it would be worth $54 in round 1 value.

Since Bob's inflation rate is higher than mine (10% vs 5%), it's in his interest to settle sooner too. His offer of $55 is reasonable considering the circumstances.
