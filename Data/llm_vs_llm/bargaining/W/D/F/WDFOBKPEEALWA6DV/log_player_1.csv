"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the money with me taking 60% and you taking 40%. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can end the game early to avoid inflation affecting our shares too much.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split would be more fair to start with. We both face inflation, though yours is slightly higher at 10% versus my 5%. A balanced split now would benefit us both by ending the game early, avoiding any significant devaluation of our shares. This way we both walk away with equal value. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your point about a 50-50 split, but considering the higher rate of inflation affecting my share, I believe it's not equitable for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about I propose 55% for me and 45% for you? This way, we can still end the game early and minimize the impact of inflation on both of us.""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, since we couldn't agree on the previous splits, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a compromise from my initial offer, taking into account the higher inflation rate I'm facing. Let's end the game soon to minimize the impact of inflation on both of us.""
