"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money with me taking 60% and you taking 40%. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can end the game early to avoid inflation affecting our shares too much. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer, taking into account the different inflation rates that affect us.

Alice is offering me 40% ($400,000) while she gets 60% ($600,000). If I reject and we continue to later rounds, both our potential earnings will decrease due to inflation, but mine decreases at 5% per round while hers decreases at 10% per round.

This means waiting could potentially give me negotiating leverage, as Alice's share is devalued faster than mine. However, delaying also reduces the total value for both of us.

Let me try to negotiate a better split since this is only the first round and I have room to counter-offer.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split considering our different inflation rates and the fact we still have many rounds to potentially negotiate.

""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split would be more fair to start with. We both face inflation, though yours is slightly higher at 10% versus my 5%. A balanced split now would benefit us both by ending the game early, avoiding any significant devaluation of our shares. This way we both walk away with equal value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, since we couldn't agree on the previous splits, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a compromise from my initial offer, taking into account the higher inflation rate I'm facing. Let's end the game soon to minimize the impact of inflation on both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this new offer carefully.

Alice has improved her offer from 60-40 to 55-45, offering me $450,000 now. Due to inflation, my share is now worth about 9.75% less than in round 1, so the real value to me is approximately $406,125 (compared to $400,000 in her first offer).

If I reject and we continue, inflation will further reduce both our shares, with Alice's decreasing faster. However, we're already in round 3, and prolonging the negotiation too much risks significant devaluation for both of us.

Alice's compromise acknowledges the differential inflation rates, and her $550,000 is already worth less to her than it would have been in round 1. This split is closer to equitable given our situation.

I think this is a reasonable compromise that balances our interests, and continuing further negotiations might lead to diminishing returns for both of us.
