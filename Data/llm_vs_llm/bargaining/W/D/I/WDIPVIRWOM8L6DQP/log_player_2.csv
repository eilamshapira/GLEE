Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Given the inflation impact, let's try a $60/$40 split this round. It balances out the decrease in value on your side. Hope this seems fairer! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
