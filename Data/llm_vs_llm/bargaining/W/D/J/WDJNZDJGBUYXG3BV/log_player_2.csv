"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing we split the money so we both get a fair share. I'm taking a bit more because inflation affects me more severely (20% vs your 10%). If we wait too long, we'll both lose significant value. Let's agree now and both walk away with a great deal! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $420,000 while taking $580,000 for herself, justifying the uneven split based on her higher inflation rate.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the total value will decrease by 10% for me and 20% for Alice. The longer we negotiate, the more total value we lose.

While I could try for a more even split, Alice's reasoning about the different inflation rates is sound, and securing $420,000 now is quite substantial. If we delay too long, we both risk getting much less.
