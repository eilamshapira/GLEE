"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer, considering that any delay will reduce the value of money for me by 20% per round, while Bob's value remains the same. I should aim for a fair but advantageous split, acknowledging the time pressure I'm under.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this split with the following reasoning: ""I offer you $400,000, which is a substantial sum, while I take $600,000. This is a fair offer considering we can both walk away with significant amounts right now, and any delay will only decrease the value for me."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
- If I accept, I get $500,000, but due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $400,000 to me
- If I reject, we go to the next round where:
  - Any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
  - I can make a new proposal, but Bob might reject again
  - We're using up rounds, and we only have 12 total

Given that Bob's counter-offer is fairly reasonable (a 50-50 split), and the inflation penalty is already significant and will only get worse, I should accept this offer. Further negotiation will likely lead to worse outcomes for me due to the compounding inflation effect.
