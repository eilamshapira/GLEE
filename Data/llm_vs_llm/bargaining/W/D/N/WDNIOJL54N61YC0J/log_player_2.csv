"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm offering you 40% and I'll take 60%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice's offer gives me $4,000, but I can counter-offer in the next round. However, due to inflation:
- My money will be worth 5% less next round
- Alice's money will be worth 20% less next round

If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice will be more pressured to accept due to her higher inflation rate. I can likely get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money loses value much faster (20% vs my 5%), I can leverage this to get a better deal. I'll propose a 70-30 split in my favor, which is more advantageous than her initial offer.

{""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Given the higher inflation rate affecting your share (20%), you should consider accepting this offer now. If we continue to the next round, your potential gains will be worth significantly less.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation is a factor, but let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a 55% share, which is still more than your previous offer, while ensuring I get a reasonable portion. Accepting this ends the game and we both get a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice is offering me $5,500, which after 9.75% inflation is worth about $4,964
2. If I reject and we go another round:
   - My inflation will increase to 14.75%
   - Alice's inflation will increase to 56%
   - The negotiating power shifts more in my favor, but the total value keeps decreasing

This is actually a good offer considering:
- It's significantly better than her first offer (40-60)
- The real value is still good despite inflation
- Further rounds will erode the total value substantially
- There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round
