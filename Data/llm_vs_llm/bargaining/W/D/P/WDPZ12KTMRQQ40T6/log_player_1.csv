# Bob's message: Hi Alice, to avoid further losses from inflation I propose we settle now. I offer $3450 for myself and $6550 for you. This split takes into account our differing rates of discounting in future roundsâ€”ensuring you get a fair value while we both avoid further devaluation. What do you say?
