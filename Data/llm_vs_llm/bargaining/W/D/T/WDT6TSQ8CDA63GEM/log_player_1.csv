"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting this is a fair starting point. Your turn to respond as Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, 55/45 is fairer! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider the actual value of the offer.

The original value of $450,000 is now worth $450,000 * 0.8 = $360,000 to me.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is not in my favor. I'd like to reject it and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in each round, I need to make a more favorable offer to myself to compensate for the inflation.

In Round 2, the value was 80% of the original, and now in Round 3, it's 80% * 80% = 64% of the original value.

So, if I offer myself $650,000, its actual value to me would be $650,000 * 0.64 = $416,000.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is my best offer!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $650,000 and giving Bob $350,000, with a message explaining that I've taken inflation into account. Your turn to respond as Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is on your side to accept this, 58/42 is a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less due to inflation (20% less in Round 2 and another 20% less in Round 3, and another 20% less in Round 4, which is 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512), I need to consider the actual value of the offer.

The original value of $420,000 is now worth $420,000 * 0.512 = $215,040 to me.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is still not in my favor, but I need to weigh it against the risk of further inflation in the next round.

However, since the value is decreasing rapidly, I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risking further losses.
