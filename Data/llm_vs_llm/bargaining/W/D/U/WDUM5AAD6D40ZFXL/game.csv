60.0,40.0,Let's get this done quickly! I'm offering a slightly better deal for me to make sure we wrap this up. What do you say?,Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Since we both lose value with each round (you lose 20% per round and I lose 10%), it's in our interest to agree quickly. I'm proposing a more balanced split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair considering we both need to come to an agreement, and it's better for you to accept now than to lose 20% value in the next round.",Bob,2,
