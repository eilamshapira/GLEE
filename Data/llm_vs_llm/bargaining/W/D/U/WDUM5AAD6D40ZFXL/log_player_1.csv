"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Since we both lose value with each round (you lose 20% per round and I lose 10%), it's in our interest to agree quickly. I'm proposing a more balanced split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair considering we both need to come to an agreement, and it's better for you to accept now than to lose 20% value in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
