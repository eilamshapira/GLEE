"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly! I'm offering a slightly better deal for me to make sure we wrap this up. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $40 out of the $100, while taking $60 for herself. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total value will decrease by 10% for me and 20% for Alice.

Let me think about this strategically. If I reject, in the next round we'll be dividing $90 for me and $80 for Alice. This means I could potentially offer a split that gives me more than $40 equivalent.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I should propose a counter-offer that's better for me but still acceptable to Alice. Given the asymmetric inflation rates (10% for me, 20% for Alice), I have a slight advantage in later rounds. However, I don't want to be too greedy and risk multiple rejections.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Since we both lose value with each round (you lose 20% per round and I lose 10%), it's in our interest to agree quickly. I'm proposing a more balanced split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair considering we both need to come to an agreement, and it's better for you to accept now than to lose 20% value in the next round.""}"
