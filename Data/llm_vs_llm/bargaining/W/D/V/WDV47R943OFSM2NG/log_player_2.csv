"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing that I (Bob) get $40, while she gets $60 out of the $100 total.

If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. That means the entire $100 pot would effectively be worth only $90 to me in the next round.

If I accept now, I get $40. If I reject and try to get more in the next round, I'd need to secure more than $44.44 (because $44.44 in round 2 is equivalent to $40 in round 1 after accounting for 10% inflation).

While Alice's offer isn't perfectly equal, it's a reasonable offer, and the risk of continued inflation makes accepting now a prudent choice.
