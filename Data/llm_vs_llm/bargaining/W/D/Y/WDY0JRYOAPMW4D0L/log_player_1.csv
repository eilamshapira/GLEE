  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""

# Bob's message: Considering inflation's impact on me, I propose 55/45. It's a fair adjustment given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering Bob's offer and the fact that the money I gain is still worth the same, while Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I think I can get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 55/45 in his favor, and considering the inflation that affects him, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself.

```

  ""message"": ""Inflation's hitting you harder, let's adjust the split to reflect that.""
}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the increasing impact of inflation on my share, I'm proposing a 50/50 split now. It's equitable considering our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a fair proposal, especially considering that Bob's share is being eroded by inflation. Since the value of my share remains the same, I think accepting this offer is a good idea.
