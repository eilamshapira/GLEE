"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob. Since I know that with each passing round, the money is worth 5% less for Bob due to inflation (while it remains the same value for me), I can use this information strategically.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest a 55-45 split in my favor. This is close to fair, but gives me a slight advantage. If Bob rejects, the next round's $100 will be worth less to him due to the 5% inflation on his side, so accepting now would be rational."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer considering the inflation effect on Bob's side.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

Since we're now in round 3, Bob is facing increased pressure from inflation. If he rejects this offer, the money will be worth even less to him in the next round. This offer is more balanced than my first one, giving Bob a slightly better deal than before while still maintaining an advantage for me given the inflation dynamics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer taking into account the increasing inflation pressure on Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is a fair 50-50 split. Given that we're now in round 5, and Bob is experiencing nearly 15% inflation, a 50-50 split should be appealing to him. If he rejects this offer, the value of his share will continue to decrease with each round. This balanced offer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while acknowledging the time pressure that affects Bob more than me."
