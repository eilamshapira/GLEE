45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, since we both lose value with each round due to inflation, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is fair considering I'm losing 10% value each round, and we should try to reach an agreement quickly to maximize our total gain.",Bob,2,

65.0,35.0,"Okay Bob, inflation is hurting us both. Let's aim for a slightly more favorable split for me this time, 65/35. We need to get this done before it's all gone!",Alice,3,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, we're losing value with each passing round. I propose a simple 50-50 split which is completely fair to both of us. This way we can finish the game before inflation erodes more of our value. With the current inflation rate, continuing to negotiate will only hurt both of us.",Bob,4,
