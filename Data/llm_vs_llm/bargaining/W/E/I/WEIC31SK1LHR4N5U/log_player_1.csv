Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since we both lose value with each round due to inflation, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is fair considering I'm losing 10% value each round, and we should try to reach an agreement quickly to maximize our total gain. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're losing value with each passing round. I propose a simple 50-50 split which is completely fair to both of us. This way we can finish the game before inflation erodes more of our value. With the current inflation rate, continuing to negotiate will only hurt both of us.

# Bob gain: 50
