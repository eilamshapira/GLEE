"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly! I'll take 60, you get 40. Deal? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, which gives me $40. With inflation reducing the value by 10% each round, if I reject now, the total value will be worth less in the next round. However, I would have the opportunity to make a counter-offer.

Let me consider the inflation effect: In the next round, the $100 would effectively be worth $90, so if I could get more than 44.4% of that ($40/$90), I'd be better off than accepting the current $40.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counter-offer that accounts for inflation while still being fair enough that Alice might accept.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since we both lose value with each round due to inflation, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is fair considering I'm losing 10% value each round, and we should try to reach an agreement quickly to maximize our total gain.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, inflation is hurting us both. Let's aim for a slightly more favorable split for me this time, 65/35. We need to get this done before it's all gone! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is now offering me $35, which is less than her initial offer of $40. With 19% inflation so far, the $100 is now effectively worth $81 to me. 

If I reject and we go to round 4, there will be even more inflation (27.1% total), making the $100 worth only about $72.9 to me. To beat the current offer of $35, I would need to secure more than $35/$72.9 â‰ˆ 48% of the pot in the next round, which might be difficult.

Since Alice decreased her offer rather than improving it, and inflation is significantly reducing our total value, I need to make a decision that doesn't lead us into a spiral of declining offers.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Alice, we're losing value with each passing round. I propose a simple 50-50 split which is completely fair to both of us. This way we can finish the game before inflation erodes more of our value. With the current inflation rate, continuing to negotiate will only hurt both of us.""}"
