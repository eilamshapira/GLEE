"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer is $40 for me and $60 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, in the next round:
   - My money will be worth 5% less
   - Alice's money will be worth 10% less
4. If I make a counter-offer, Alice might reject, leading to further devaluation

While I could try to negotiate for more, the devaluation risk makes this a reasonable offer. $40 now is better than potentially getting slightly more but worth less in future rounds.
