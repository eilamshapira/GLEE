"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I will make the first offer, keeping in mind that I want to secure a reasonable amount for myself while also making the offer appealing enough for Bob to accept.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a fair offer, and it's still early in the game. I'll accept it to avoid potentially getting less later on.

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
