"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer of $4,000 for me and $6,000 for her. While I'd get a substantial amount, it's less than half of the total. Since this is just the first round and I'll get to make the next offer if I reject, I think I can try to negotiate a more balanced split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll offer a more balanced split that's fair to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose we split the money equally - $5,000 for each of us. This is the fairest division and gives us both a significant amount."
