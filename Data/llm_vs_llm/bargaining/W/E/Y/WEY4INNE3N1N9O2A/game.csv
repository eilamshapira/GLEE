600000.0,400000.0,I propose a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking the initiative. This is a fair offer considering we both want to maximize our gains.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,Let's split it closer to the middle. I'm factoring in the potential for inflation affecting my share in future rounds if we keep negotiating. 55/45 seems fair.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Given that inflation is affecting your gains with each round, it's in your best interest to accept this offer now. If we continue negotiating, your share will be worth even less in the next round. This is still a substantial amount for you, and we can both walk away with significant gains.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
475000.0,525000.0,"Inflation is hurting me more each round, but a 65/35 split is too unfair. I'm offering a slightly smaller portion for myself than last time to compensate for the ongoing inflation. Let's meet in the middle.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"With inflation now at 27.1% and increasing, your effective gain is diminishing rapidly with each round. While this 70-30 split might seem aggressive, your $300000 now is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds. Let's conclude this negotiation before inflation erodes your purchasing power further.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
490000.0,510000.0,"The inflation is killing me, but 70/30 is robbery! I'm dropping my ask again, hoping we can find common ground before there's nothing left. 51/49, a slight edge for me to account for past inflation losses.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"At this point, inflation has reduced your purchasing power by over 40%. Your $250000 now, while seemingly small, is actually worth more than larger amounts in future rounds as inflation continues to increase. This is your best option - if we continue negotiating, inflation will only make things worse for you.",Alice,7,
