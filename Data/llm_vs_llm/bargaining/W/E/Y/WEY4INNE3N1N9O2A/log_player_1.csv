"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking the initiative. This is a fair offer considering we both want to maximize our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it closer to the middle. I'm factoring in the potential for inflation affecting my share in future rounds if we keep negotiating. 55/45 seems fair. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept this offer, I get $450,000 (full value)
2. If I reject:
   - I can make another offer in the next round
   - But Bob might reject again
   - And the money's value for Bob will decrease further
   - My money maintains its value
   - This gives me more negotiating power in the next round

Since I know Bob is affected by inflation and I'm not, and since $450,000 is less than my initial offer, I should reject and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Given that inflation is affecting your gains with each round, it's in your best interest to accept this offer now. If we continue negotiating, your share will be worth even less in the next round. This is still a substantial amount for you, and we can both walk away with significant gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hurting me more each round, but a 65/35 split is too unfair. I'm offering a slightly smaller portion for myself than last time to compensate for the ongoing inflation. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $475,000 (full value)
   * Bob gets $525,000 (but it's worth 27.1% less, so effectively about $382,725)

2. If I reject:
   * I can make another offer in next round
   * Bob's inflation will increase further
   * My purchasing power stays the same
   * This strengthens my negotiating position even more

Since Bob is experiencing significant inflation (27.1%) and this offer is still below what I could reasonably get given my stronger position, I should reject and push for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""With inflation now at 27.1% and increasing, your effective gain is diminishing rapidly with each round. While this 70-30 split might seem aggressive, your $300,000 now is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds. Let's conclude this negotiation before inflation erodes your purchasing power further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The inflation is killing me, but 70/30 is robbery! I'm dropping my ask again, hoping we can find common ground before there's nothing left. 51/49, a slight edge for me to account for past inflation losses. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $490,000 (full value)
   * Bob gets $510,000 (but it's worth 40.95% less, so effectively about $301,155)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round inflation will be even higher for Bob
   * My purchasing power remains unchanged
   * Bob's position is getting weaker with each round
   * I can make an offer that Bob might be forced to accept due to the severe inflation

Given that Bob is now experiencing over 40% inflation and my position continues to strengthen, this offer is still not optimal. I can likely secure a better deal by rejecting and making another offer.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""At this point, inflation has reduced your purchasing power by over 40%. Your $250,000 now, while seemingly small, is actually worth more than larger amounts in future rounds as inflation continues to increase. This is your best option - if we continue negotiating, inflation will only make things worse for you.""}"
