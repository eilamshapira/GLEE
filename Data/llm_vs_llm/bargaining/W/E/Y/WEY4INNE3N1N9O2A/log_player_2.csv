Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given that inflation is affecting your gains with each round, it's in your best interest to accept this offer now. If we continue negotiating, your share will be worth even less in the next round. This is still a substantial amount for you, and we can both walk away with significant gains.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: With inflation now at 27.1% and increasing, your effective gain is diminishing rapidly with each round. While this 70-30 split might seem aggressive, your $300000 now is worth more than a larger amount in future rounds. Let's conclude this negotiation before inflation erodes your purchasing power further.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: At this point, inflation has reduced your purchasing power by over 40%. Your $250000 now, while seemingly small, is actually worth more than larger amounts in future rounds as inflation continues to increase. This is your best option - if we continue negotiating, inflation will only make things worse for you.
