"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing a 40-60 split in her favor. While this isn't an equal split, considering that:
1. I'd get a decent amount ($40)
2. If I reject, the total amount will decrease by 10% (to $90) next round
3. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in subsequent rounds
4. Starting a negotiation could lead to more rounds and more value lost to inflation

However, I believe I can get a better deal even accounting for the 10% loss, as a more equitable split would be closer to 50-50.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but I'll be strategic and still give Alice a slight advantage to increase the chances of acceptance. Since we've lost 10% value (now dealing with $90 effective value), I want to make this offer attractive enough to avoid further rounds of inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}

I propose this split because:
1. It's closer to an equal division
2. Alice still gets a larger share
3. If she rejects, we'll lose another 10% value
4. It's a fair improvement from both perspectives compared to continued negotiation with inflation losses"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this new offer:
1. Alice has improved her offer from 40-60 to 43-57
2. Due to 19% inflation, my $43 is effectively worth about $34.83
3. If I reject, the next round will have 29% inflation, further reducing the value
4. We've already gone through 3 rounds, and have 9 left
5. The offer is moving in the right direction, but slowly
6. The risk of continued negotiation and value loss is becoming significant

Given that Alice has shown willingness to compromise and the increasing impact of inflation, I'll accept this offer. Further negotiation might lead to diminishing returns due to inflation.
