6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a generous split! I'm offering you $4000. What do you say?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Since your money loses 20% value each round, this $4000 now is worth more to you than $6000 would be in future rounds. This is a fair offer considering the depreciation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Okay, let's try a 50/50 split this time. It seems fair, right? What do you think?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Consider this carefully: due to the 44% depreciation, any money you get next round will be worth even less to you. This $3000 now is worth more than $5000 would be two rounds from now. Let's conclude this now - it's in both our interests.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alright, I understand the pressure. Let's adjust slightly. How about $4500 for me and $5500 for you? This is still a good deal for you with the constant value of the money.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"Let's be practical - your $2500 now is worth more than $4500 next round due to the 67% depreciation you're facing. If we continue negotiating, your share will be worth even less. This is actually a better deal for you than your last offer, considering the time value of your money. Let's end this now.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Okay, one last try. How about $4000 for me, $6000 for you? I'm hoping to still get a decent share and also finish the game.  Let's end it here.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"Look at the numbers carefully: your $4000 from last round was only worth $1048 to you due to depreciation. This $2000 now is worth more than $4000 would be next round, as your money will lose another 20% value. We're running out of rounds, and your position gets worse each time. This is actually a rational offer given the circumstances - let's conclude this now.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Okay, let's try this. I'll take $3500, you get $6500. It's still not ideal for me, but we are getting close to the end. Is it a deal?",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
1500.0,8500.0,"We have only 2 rounds left before we both get nothing. Your $3500 from last round was worth only $587 to you due to depreciation. This $1500 now is actually worth more to you than $3500 next round, as your money will depreciate another 20%. Let's not risk getting nothing - this is a rational deal given the massive depreciation you're facing. Accept now and we both walk away with something.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Okay, one last time! I'm offering $3000 to me, and $7000 to you. We're almost out of time. Don't let us both get nothing. Please accept!",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,accept
