"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a generous split! I'm offering you $4000. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10,000, which means she keeps $6000. While this isn't a terrible offer, I know that:
1. Alice's money loses 20% value each round
2. My money keeps its full value
3. I can make a counter-offer next round

If I reject, Alice's $6000 would only be worth $4800 to her next round, while any amount I get maintains its value. This gives me negotiating leverage.

I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer and making my own proposal next round, when Alice's position is weaker due to the 20% depreciation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice's money has already depreciated 20% in value for her, I'll propose a more favorable split for me while still being reasonable enough for her to consider accepting.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Since your money loses 20% value each round, this $4000 now is worth more to you than $6000 would be in future rounds. This is a fair offer considering the depreciation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try a 50/50 split this time. It seems fair, right? What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering a 50/50 split ($5000 each)
2. For Alice, her $5000 is actually worth only $3200 (64% of original value) due to the 36% depreciation
3. My $5000 maintains its full value
4. We have 9 rounds left, and Alice's money will continue to depreciate

While this is a better offer than the first one, I still have a strong negotiating position because:
- Alice's money will be worth even less next round (44% less than original)
- I can make a counter-offer when her position is weaker
- A 50/50 split doesn't account for the fact that my money holds value while hers depreciates

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice's money has now depreciated 44% in value for her, I'll propose a split that reflects this reality while still being attractive enough for her to accept rather than risk further depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Consider this carefully: due to the 44% depreciation, any money you get next round will be worth even less to you. This $3000 now is worth more than $5000 would be two rounds from now. Let's conclude this now - it's in both our interests.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright, I understand the pressure. Let's adjust slightly. How about $4500 for me and $5500 for you? This is still a good deal for you with the constant value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me $5500 and keeping $4500
2. Due to 59.04% depreciation, Alice's $4500 is only worth about $1843 to her
3. My $5500 maintains full value
4. We have 7 rounds left
5. Next round, Alice's money will be worth roughly 67% less than original value

This offer is better than her previous ones, but given:
- The severe depreciation of her share
- My strong negotiating position (my money keeps value)
- The fact that we still have several rounds left
- The next round I can propose an even more favorable split

I believe I can still get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","With Alice's money now worth 67% less for her, and considering she's shown willingness to move towards more favorable terms for me, I'll make an offer that strongly favors me while still giving her enough incentive to accept rather than risk further depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 7500,
""alice_gain"": 2500,
""message"": ""Let's be practical - your $2500 now is worth more than $4500 next round due to the 67% depreciation you're facing. If we continue negotiating, your share will be worth even less. This is actually a better deal for you than your last offer, considering the time value of your money. Let's end this now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, one last try. How about $4000 for me, $6000 for you? I'm hoping to still get a decent share and also finish the game.  Let's end it here. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $6000 and keeping $4000
2. Due to 73.79% depreciation, Alice's $4000 is only worth about $1048 to her
3. My $6000 maintains full value
4. We have 5 rounds left
5. Next round, Alice's money will be worth roughly 79% less than original value

While this is her best offer yet, considering:
- Her money has lost nearly 3/4 of its value
- She's shown a clear pattern of making increasingly better offers for me
- I can make a counter-offer next round when her position is even weaker
- We still have several rounds left

I believe I should continue pushing for an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","With Alice's money now worth about 79% less for her, and seeing her last offer showing increasing desperation to conclude, I'll make a strong offer that should be hard to refuse given the severe depreciation she's facing.

{""bob_gain"": 8000,
""alice_gain"": 2000,
""message"": ""Look at the numbers carefully: your $4000 from last round was only worth $1048 to you due to depreciation. This $2000 now is worth more than $4000 would be next round, as your money will lose another 20% value. We're running out of rounds, and your position gets worse each time. This is actually a rational offer given the circumstances - let's conclude this now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try this. I'll take $3500, you get $6500. It's still not ideal for me, but we are getting close to the end. Is it a deal? 
# Bob gain: 6500 
# Alice gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me $6500 and keeping $3500
2. Due to 83.22% depreciation, Alice's $3500 is only worth about $587 to her
3. My $6500 maintains full value
4. We only have 3 rounds left
5. Next round, her money will be worth roughly 87% less

While the game is getting close to the end (which risks both of us getting nothing), there are several key factors:
- Her money has lost over 83% of its value
- She's consistently offering better terms
- With 3 rounds left, there's still room to negotiate
- Her extremely weak position due to massive depreciation

Given these factors and that I can make one more counter-offer with her money worth even less, I should push for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","With Alice's money now worth 87% less, only 2 rounds remaining, and her showing clear willingness to compromise, I'll make what should be a compelling final offer:

{""bob_gain"": 8500,
""alice_gain"": 1500,
""message"": ""We have only 2 rounds left before we both get nothing. Your $3500 from last round was worth only $587 to you due to depreciation. This $1500 now is actually worth more to you than $3500 next round, as your money will depreciate another 20%. Let's not risk getting nothing - this is a rational deal given the massive depreciation you're facing. Accept now and we both walk away with something.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 89.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, one last time! I'm offering $3000 to me, and $7000 to you. We're almost out of time. Don't let us both get nothing. Please accept! 
# Bob gain: 7000 
# Alice gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me carefully analyze this critical situation:

1. We're at round 11 of 12 - only ONE round left after this
2. If we don't agree in these final two rounds, we BOTH get NOTHING
3. Alice is offering me $7000 (full value) and keeping $3000 (worth only about $322 to her due to 89.26% depreciation)
4. If I reject, I can make one final offer, but if she rejects that, we both get zero

While I might be tempted to push for an even better deal in the final round, this is extremely risky because:
- If Alice rejects my final offer (which is likely if I get too greedy), we both get nothing
- Getting $7000 is much better than risking getting nothing
- Alice has shown she's willing to walk away rather than accept extremely unfavorable terms
- This is actually a very good offer given there's only one round left

The risk of getting nothing outweighs the potential benefit of trying for a better deal in the final round.
