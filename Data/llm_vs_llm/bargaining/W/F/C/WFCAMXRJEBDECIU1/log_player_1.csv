"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid the 5% inflation penalty from prolonging negotiations.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split it 55-45. A little better for me, but still avoids further inflation for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* If I accept now, I get $45, but due to 5% inflation, it's effectively worth $42.75 to me
* If I reject and propose again, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
* There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer, leading to more inflation
* Bob's offer gives me a decent share while avoiding further devaluation
