"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting that this is a fair starting point. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, a bit more balanced! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Bob's offer gives me $450,000, but due to the 10% inflation, the value of the money I receive is effectively $450,000 * 0.9 = $405,000.

Considering this, I think I can do better. My response is:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than the original value (10% less in Round 2 and another 10% less in Round 3).

To calculate the effective value, I'll multiply the amount I propose to take by 0.8 (1 - 0.2 inflation).

Let's say I propose to take $550,000. The effective value would be $550,000 * 0.8 = $440,000.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""My turn again, hoping for a better split!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $550,000 and giving Bob $450,000, with a message indicating that I'm hoping for a better split. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is on your side, time to adjust! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

Bob's offer gives me $400,000, but due to the 27.1% inflation, the value of the money I receive is effectively $400,000 * (1 - 0.271) = $400,000 * 0.729 = $291,600.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is quite low, especially since the money he gains is still worth the full amount. My response is:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 34.39% less than the original value (10% less in Round 2, 10% less in Round 3, and 10% less in Round 4, compounded: 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.729, and then 10% less in Round 5: 0.729 * 0.9 = 0.6561, which is approximately 34.39% less).

To calculate the effective value, I'll multiply the amount I propose to take by 0.6561 (1 - 0.3439 inflation).

Let's say I propose to take $520,000. The effective value would be $520,000 * 0.6561 = $341,073.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Getting desperate, let's find a middle ground!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $520,000 and giving Bob $480,000, with a message indicating that I'm getting desperate and hoping to find a middle ground. Let's see how Bob responds!"
