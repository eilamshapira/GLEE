"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether to accept this offer or to make a counter-offer.

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total amount will be worth 10% less (so $900,000 total).

If I reject and propose in the next round, I could offer a more favorable split for myself, but Alice might reject that as well, leading to further depreciation of the total amount.

Given that $400,000 is a substantial amount, even if it's less than half, I'll make my decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's fair but slightly more favorable to me, considering the 10% inflation that has already occurred.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing that I receive $550,000 and Alice receives $450,000. This is a reasonable split that gives me a slight majority while still offering Alice a substantial portion. Given that we've already lost 10% of the value by moving to round 2, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now rather than continuing to lose value through further rounds of negotiation."
