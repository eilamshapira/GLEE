"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 400,000$ out of 1,000,000$
2. If I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, if I wait:
   * Next round the money will be worth 5% less to me
   * 400,000$ now > 380,000$ (400,000$ - 5%) next round
4. I could counter-offer a better split, but Alice might reject
5. A 40/60 split isn't terrible, and securing a deal now avoids inflation risk
