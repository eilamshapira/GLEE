"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less with each round, I need to consider the value of the money now. My initial offer was for $60, but now it is worth 10% less. Bob is offering me $50, I need to assess if that is better than nothing. 

The offered $50 is higher than I have proposed, and it is more than half of the total.

Therefore, I will accept the offer.
