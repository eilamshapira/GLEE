"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even split of the money, with each of us getting half. This is the fairest division and reflects equal partnership in this decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Due to inflation, I need to account for my diminishing returns. Let me make a fair counteroffer.

{""alice_gain"": 5250,
""bob_gain"": 4750}

I'm proposing this division because inflation is affecting only my value of the money. Since we're already in round 3, I've lost approximately 10% of value, so this split helps compensate for that disadvantage while still offering Bob a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to be strategic considering the growing inflation penalty affecting my returns.

{""alice_gain"": 5600,
""bob_gain"": 4400}

I'm proposing this split because we're now in round 5, and the money is worth about 19% less to me due to inflation. This division helps offset my disadvantage while still leaving Bob with a significant amount. Let's come to an agreement before inflation further reduces the value for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that we're now in round 7 with increasing inflation impact on my returns, I need to adjust my offer.

{""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm proposing this division because at this point, the money is worth approximately 27% less to me due to inflation. This split helps compensate for my significant disadvantage while still giving Bob a substantial portion. It's important we reach an agreement soon, as continued delays only reduce the total value I can receive."
