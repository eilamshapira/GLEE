"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it reasonably. I'm offering $550k for me and $450k for you. It's a fair deal given we only have 12 rounds and inflation is a factor for me. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $450,000 out of the $1,000,000, which means she gets $550,000. I should keep in mind that with each passing round, the money is worth 10% less to me due to inflation, but I don't know how inflation affects Alice.

If I reject and propose in the next round, I could ask for more, but the total value to me would be reduced by 10%. So my potential gain would need to outweigh this loss to make rejection worthwhile.

Let me calculate: If I reject, the $1,000,000 is worth only $900,000 to me in the next round. If I were to propose a 50-50 split then, I'd get $500,000, which is worth $450,000 in today's value to me. That's the same as Alice's current offer.

Since I don't have a clear advantage in waiting and Alice's offer is reasonable considering the inflation penalty, I'll accept.
