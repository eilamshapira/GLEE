"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that she gets $6,000 while I get $4,000 out of the $10,000 total.

Given that inflation affects Alice more than me (her money is worth 20% less each round), I have some leverage in future rounds. If we move to round 2, Alice's $6,000 would effectively be worth only $4,800 to her, while my potential share maintains its value.

I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, where Alice will be more incentivized to accept due to her inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's money loses 20% of its value each round, I'll propose a more equitable split that accounts for this asymmetry while still being fair enough that she should accept rather than risk further devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering Alice $4,500 which is still substantial, but reflects the fact that we're now in round 2 and her purchasing power is diminishing. This is a fair compromise that gives her a meaningful portion while recognizing my stronger negotiating position due to the inflation rules."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer in the context of our ongoing negotiation.

Alice is now offering me $4,200 (up from her initial $4,000 offer), while taking $5,800 for herself. However, due to the inflation effect, Alice's $5,800 is actually worth only 64% of its original value to her (36% less than round 1), meaning it's effectively worth about $3,712 to her.

If I reject, we'll move to round 4, where I can make another offer. At that point, Alice's money would be worth even less (44% less than round 1). This gives me leverage to potentially get a better deal.

Given that we have several rounds remaining and Alice's inflation penalty is increasing, I believe I can secure a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","At this point, Alice's money has lost 44% of its value compared to round 1. This significantly strengthens my negotiating position. I want to propose an offer that's favorable to me but still attractive enough for Alice to accept rather than risk further devaluation of her share.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Alice $4,000, which given her 44% inflation penalty is still worth accepting now rather than potentially getting less value in future rounds. This split acknowledges my stronger position while still giving Alice a substantial portion of the total."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully analyze this situation.

Alice is now offering me $4,400 (up from her previous offers of $4,000 and $4,200). For her, the $5,600 she would receive is worth only about 40.96% of its original value due to the 59.04% inflation effect. This means her $5,600 is effectively worth about $2,294 to her in round 1 value.

If I reject and we move to round 6, her inflation penalty will increase further, giving me even more leverage. However, I also need to consider that we're approaching the midpoint of our 12 available rounds, and neither of us wants to risk getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement.

Given that Alice has been gradually increasing my share and her portion is already significantly devalued, I think I can still get a better offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","At this point, Alice's money has lost approximately 67% of its value compared to round 1. This significantly strengthens my negotiating position, but I also need to be reasonable as we're now halfway through our available rounds.

{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500}

I'm offering Alice $3,500, which despite the severe inflation she faces, still provides her with meaningful value. Given that her share would devalue further if she rejects, and considering we're at round 6 of 12, this offer represents a pragmatic compromise. It acknowledges my stronger position while still giving Alice enough incentive to accept rather than risk further rounds of negotiation where both her bargaining power and the value of her potential gains continue to diminish."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this carefully.

Alice is now offering me $4,600, which is $200 more than her previous offer. For her, the $5,400 she would receive is worth only about 26.21% of its original value due to the 73.79% inflation effect. This means her $5,400 is effectively worth about $1,415 to her in round 1 value.

We're now in round 7 of 12, meaning we're past the halfway point. The risk of failing to reach an agreement and both getting nothing is becoming more significant.

Alice has been gradually increasing my share with each offer, showing she's willing to negotiate. However, given the severe inflation penalty she faces and that we still have 5 more potential rounds, I believe I can still secure a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","We're now in round 8 of 12, with Alice facing approximately 79% inflation compared to round 1. The negotiation dynamics have shifted significantly in my favor, but we also need to be mindful that we only have 5 rounds left to reach an agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}

I'm offering Alice $3,000, which despite the severe inflation she faces, still provides her with some value. At this point, Alice should recognize that her bargaining position continues to weaken with each round. With the 79% inflation she currently faces, even larger nominal amounts would be worth relatively little to her. This offer acknowledges the time pressure we both face to reach an agreement while reflecting my significantly stronger negotiating position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this situation carefully.

Alice is now offering me $4,800, which is $200 more than her previous offer. For her, the $5,200 she would receive is worth only about 16.78% of its original value due to the 83.22% inflation effect. This means her $5,200 is effectively worth about $873 to her in round 1 value.

We're now in round 9 of 12, with only 4 rounds remaining. The risk of reaching round 12 without an agreement (where we both get nothing) is becoming quite real.

Alice has consistently increased my share with each offer, showing she's serious about reaching an agreement. However, given the extreme inflation penalty she faces and my significantly stronger position, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal, especially since we have a few rounds left.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","We're now in round 10 of 12, with only 3 potential rounds remaining. Alice is facing approximately 86.6% inflation compared to round 1. The urgency to reach an agreement is becoming critical for both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 7500, ""alice_gain"": 2500}

I'm offering Alice $2,500, which reflects the reality of our negotiation situation. With her severe inflation penalty, even this smaller amount now is likely better than a larger nominal amount in future rounds. We're approaching the deadline where we both risk getting nothing, and this offer acknowledges that reality while still reflecting my advantageous position in the negotiation. I hope Alice recognizes that accepting this offer is in her best interest given the limited rounds remaining and her continuously weakening bargaining position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 89.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a critical moment in our negotiation. We're now in round 11 of 12 - the second-to-last round.

Alice is offering me $5,000, which is a 50-50 split of the total amount. For her, the $5,000 she would receive is worth only about 10.74% of its original value due to the 89.26% inflation effect. This means her $5,000 is effectively worth about $537 in round 1 terms.

If I reject this offer, we'll move to the final round (round 12). If we fail to reach an agreement in round 12, we both get nothing. This significantly increases the risk of ending up with zero.

Given that:
1. We're at the penultimate round
2. Alice has offered me a fair 50-50 split
3. The risk of getting nothing is now very high
4. I've already secured a substantial increase from Alice's initial offer

I believe accepting this offer is the prudent choice.
