"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. Given that inflation affects you more than me (10% vs 5%), I think a slight adjustment in my favor is fair. This way we can both still get a good outcome before inflation reduces our total value too much. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
