"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I'm hoping we can reach a deal quickly! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully.

Alice is proposing that I receive $45 and she receives $55. While this isn't an even 50-50 split, it's close to fair. I need to consider that with each passing round, inflation reduces the value by 5% for me and 10% for Alice. If I reject and we go to the next round, I could propose a better split for myself, but the total value will decrease.

Since the inflation rate is higher for Alice (10%) than for me (5%), I have a slight strategic advantage in delaying. However, if we delay too much, we both lose value.

Given this is just the first round and I believe I can propose a more favorable split for myself, I'll reject this offer.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while acknowledging Alice's initial proposal.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Alice. Given that inflation affects you more than me (10% vs 5%), I think a slight adjustment in my favor is fair. This way we can both still get a good outcome before inflation reduces our total value too much.""}"
