"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly and end the game quickly! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is objectively fair
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 5% less to me
   - Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation
3. With 50$ now, I get full value
4. If I try to negotiate for more next round, the maximum I could get would be worth less due to inflation

A bird in hand is worth two in the bush - this is a fair offer and avoiding inflation risk is smart.
