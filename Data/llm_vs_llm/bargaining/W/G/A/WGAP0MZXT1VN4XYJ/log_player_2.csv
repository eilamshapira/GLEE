"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start by splitting it fairly. I get 600k, you get 400k. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me after each round, I'll make a more favorable offer to myself to account for the loss in value.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""My turn! Considering the decreasing value, I'm being generous with 45% for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about a better deal? I get 650k, you get 350k this time. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 9.75% decrease in value for me, the actual value I'd get is approximately 317,625 (350,000 * 0.9075). This is still a significant decrease, and Alice's offer doesn't seem to take into account the inflation affecting me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth even less for me now (5% less each round, so 14.76% less than the original value after 3 rounds), I'll make an offer that reflects this.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Inflation is eating away at my share, so I need a better deal. 60% for me, or we keep going.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise! I propose 700k for me and 300k for you. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 18.55% decrease in value for me, the actual value I'd get is approximately 244,545 (300,000 * 0.8155). This is a significant decrease, and Alice's offer still seems to favor her heavily.

However, as the rounds go on, the value of my potential share will continue to decrease. I need to weigh the potential benefits of continuing to negotiate against the risk of losing even more value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth even less for me now (5% less each round, so 22.62% less than the original value after 5 rounds), I'll make an offer that reflects this. I'll try to balance my need for a decent share with the decreasing value.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make it simple: I propose 750k for me and 250k for you. It's a fair deal given the situation. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 26.49% decrease in value for me, the actual value I'd get is approximately 183,255 (250,000 * 0.7335). This is a substantial decrease, and Alice's offer still seems to favor her heavily.

However, as the rounds continue, the value of my potential share will continue to decrease. I'm starting to lose significant value, and it might be better to accept a less favorable deal now rather than risking an even worse outcome later.
