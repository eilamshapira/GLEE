"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more as the first mover. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount without risking inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice's offer is a 45-55 split, giving me $450,000 and her $550,000. While not exactly equal, it's a reasonable first offer considering:

1. I don't face any inflation risk, so my $450,000 maintains its value
2. It's a substantial amount that's close to a 50-50 split
3. Rejecting could lead to a negotiation spiral where we both end up with nothing
4. Getting $450,000 now is better than risking getting less or nothing later

While I could counter-offer for a more even split, the current offer is good enough that the potential benefit doesn't outweigh the risk.
