"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me propose a division that considers both our interests, knowing that delays will affect both of us (though Bob more severely).

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because while I aim to maximize my gain, I also want to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept to avoid value loss through inflation. A 60-40 split is more favorable than an even split for me while still being reasonable enough that Bob might accept it rather than risk losing value through inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept this 50-50 split now, I'll get $50 with 5% inflation = $47.50 in round 1 value
- If I reject, I can make another offer, but we'll both face more inflation
- Bob is facing steeper inflation (20% per round), which strengthens my negotiating position
- However, there's no guarantee Bob will accept a better offer in the next round

Since I can make another offer in the next round and Bob's money is devaluing faster than mine, I believe I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob already offered a 50-50 split and is facing steeper inflation (20% per round), I should be able to negotiate a better position. However, I need to be careful not to be too aggressive as we both lose if we don't reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I propose this split because:
1. Bob is losing value faster (20% per round vs my 5%)
2. We've already seen Bob is willing to do a 50-50 split
3. The 65-35 split, while more aggressive than my first offer, takes advantage of Bob's worsening position while still being potentially acceptable given the inflation pressure"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

- If I accept now:
  * I get $55 with 14.26% inflation = $47.16 in round 1 value
  * This is slightly less than what I would have gotten accepting the 50-50 split in round 2

- If I reject:
  * Next round I'll face 19% inflation (another 5%)
  * Bob will face 59% inflation (another 20%)
  * The value is deteriorating quickly for both of us
  * We've already used 4 of our 12 rounds

While I might be able to negotiate a better split, the risk of further value loss and potential deadlock is becoming significant. Bob has moved from 50-50 to 55-45 in my favor, showing some willingness to compromise.
