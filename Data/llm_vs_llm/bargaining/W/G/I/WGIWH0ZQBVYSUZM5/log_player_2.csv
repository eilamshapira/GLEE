"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make this fair and efficient. I'm offering you a generous 45% to avoid losing value through inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer carefully.

Alice is offering me 45% of the $1,000,000, which is $450,000, while she would keep $550,000 (55%).

If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total pot will be worth 10% less ($900,000). This means even if I proposed a 50-50 split in the next round, I would get $450,000 - exactly the same amount Alice is offering me now.

Since I can't do better than $450,000 in the next round without asking for more than 50% (which Alice might reject), and further delays would reduce the total value even more, this is actually a reasonable offer.
