"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of the $100, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me but potentially not Bob. I'll start with a relatively generous offer to try and secure a deal early on.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to evaluate this offer. My money is worth 20% less, and Bob's is worth 10% less. Let's consider the worth of the money, from my perspective only:

*   **Bob's offer:** Alice gets $50, which is worth $50 * 0.8 = $40 (in round 1 dollars for me).

I'm going to reject this offer. I think I can still get a better deal, considering I have more rounds to play.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, my money is now worth even less. I need to be more strategic. I'll try to make an offer that's still appealing to Bob, but more favorable to me, considering the increasing inflation for me.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, this is getting serious with the inflation. Let me analyze Bob's offer:

*   **Bob's offer:** Alice gets $45, which is worth $45 * (1-0.488) = $45 * 0.512 = $23.04 (in round 1 dollars for me).

That's a significantly lower value than I'd like. I'm still going to reject, as I believe I can get a better deal, even if it's only slightly better.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the decreasing value of money for me. I need to be more realistic, but still try to maximize my gain.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer in this round:

*   **Bob's offer:** Alice gets $40, which is worth $40 * (1-0.6723) = $40 * 0.3277 = $13.108 (in round 1 dollars for me).

This is a very low value for me. I need to make a calculated decision. I will reject the offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Alright, I am running out of time, and the inflation is killing me. I need to make a more appealing offer that Bob will hopefully accept, while still getting something reasonable for myself.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}
```"
