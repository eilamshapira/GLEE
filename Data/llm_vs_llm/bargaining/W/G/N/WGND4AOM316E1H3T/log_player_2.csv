"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split of the $10,000, which would give me $5,000. If I reject and we go to the next round, I'll be able to make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation, meaning the total value to me would effectively be $8,000 instead of $10,000.

Let me calculate: If I reject, I could propose a split in the next round, but even if I asked for the entire $10,000 (which Alice would likely reject), it would only be worth $8,000 to me due to inflation. So the maximum I could potentially get in the next round would be worth less than $8,000 to me.

Given that Alice's current offer gives me $5,000 and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky, I should accept this fair offer now.
