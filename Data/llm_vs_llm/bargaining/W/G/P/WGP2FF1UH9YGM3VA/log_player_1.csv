"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept, considering the inflation factor. Since this is the first round, I'll try to be generous but still ensure I get a significant portion.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this. My money is worth 10% less now. Accepting this offer would give me $450,000, which is worth $450,000 * 0.9 = $405,000 in round 1 dollars. If I reject, I get to make an offer, but then *all* the money will be worth 10% less for me in the next round.

I'll accept this offer.

""decision"": ""accept""
