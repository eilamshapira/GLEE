40.0,60.0,"Alice, considering the inflation is already reducing the value of your share, it's in both our interests to finalize things now. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Accepting this offer guarantees you $40 before any further erosion in value. Let's avoid additional rounds and secure our gains today.",Bob,4,

47.0,53.0,"Alice, any further delay will only hurt your share due to inflation. While a fair split would be 50-50 in nominal terms, waiting means you'll effectively lose more value. Accepting this offer secures $47 for you immediately, rather than a diminished amount later. Let's settle now and both walk away with a guaranteed value.",Bob,6,
