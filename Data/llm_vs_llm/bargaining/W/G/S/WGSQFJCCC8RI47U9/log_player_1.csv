"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's agree quickly to avoid any inflation hits. I propose that I receive $55 and you get $45. Looking forward to your prompt acceptance so we both benefit from a swift resolution.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Since we're both dividing the same pot and trying to avoid inflation effects, I think an equal 50-50 split is the fairest outcome for both of us. This way we both walk away with an equitable share without further delays. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
