"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's agree quickly to avoid any inflation hits. I propose that I receive $55 and you get $45. Looking forward to your prompt acceptance so we both benefit from a swift resolution. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice is proposing that I get $45 while she gets $55. Since there's no inflation for me (0% effect), my $45 won't lose value in future rounds. However, I don't know what inflation effect Alice faces.

This offer gives me 45% of the total, which isn't quite an even split, but it's reasonably close. If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice might reject my proposal, and we'd continue negotiating with potential inflation effects for her.

Given that:
1. The offer isn't completely unreasonable
2. I don't have inflation pressure
3. Continuing negotiations has uncertain outcomes

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round since I believe we can reach a more equitable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair counter-offer to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Since we're both dividing the same pot and trying to avoid inflation effects, I think an equal 50-50 split is the fairest outcome for both of us. This way we both walk away with an equitable share without further delays. What do you think?""}"
