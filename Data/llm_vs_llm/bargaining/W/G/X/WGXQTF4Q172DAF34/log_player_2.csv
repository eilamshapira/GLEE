"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 52.5 
# Alice gain: 47.5 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Even with the inflation, getting $52.5 is better than risking getting a worse offer in the next round."
