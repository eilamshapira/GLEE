5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for round 1: I’ll take $5500 and you’ll get $4500. Since each additional round means a 20% devaluation on my end, I believe it’s in both our best interests to settle quickly. I’d appreciate your fair-minded acceptance so we can avoid any unnecessary loss. Looking forward to your thoughts.",Alice,1,
