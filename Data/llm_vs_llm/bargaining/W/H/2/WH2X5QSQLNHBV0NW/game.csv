689655.0,310345.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1000000 so that you get $310345 and I get $689655. This offer reflects our future discounting (5% for me, 10% for you) and ensures you receive what you’d otherwise secure by waiting. I believe it’s a fair and efficient division given the circumstances—let’s agree now to avoid any further loss in value.",Alice,1,
