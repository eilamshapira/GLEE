"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $1000000 so that you get $310345 and I get $689655. This offer reflects our future discounting (5% for me, 10% for you) and ensures you receive what you’d otherwise secure by waiting. I believe it’s a fair and efficient division given the circumstances—let’s agree now to avoid any further loss in value. 
# Bob gain: 310345 
# Alice gain: 689655 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm evaluating Alice's offer carefully.

If I reject, we move to round 2 where I make a proposal, but the money is worth 10% less to me. If we reached round 2, the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $900,000 to me.

Alice's current offer gives me $310,345. This is actually a strategic calculation on her part - she's trying to offer me exactly what I would ultimately get if we continued to future rounds (considering our different discount rates).

While the split isn't equal, it does account for our different discount rates, and I would likely end up with a similar amount even if we negotiated further, due to my higher discount rate.
