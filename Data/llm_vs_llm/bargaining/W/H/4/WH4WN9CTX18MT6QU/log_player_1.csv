"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game and the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

My reasoning:

*   I'm starting with a slightly favorable offer for myself (55%), but it's not so greedy that Bob will immediately reject it.
*   I'm hoping Bob will accept this, as the longer we wait, the less the money is worth to him due to inflation."
