"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, but slightly in my favor since Bob has the power to counter-offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose that I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount while being close to equal."
