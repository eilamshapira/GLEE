"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing I get $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total. While this is less than half, it's still a substantial amount.

Since there's no inflation for me (0% less each round), I don't lose value by continuing to the next round. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which could give me leverage in future rounds if she faces significant inflation.

By rejecting, I can make my own proposal next round. I could potentially secure a larger share for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced division while being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I suggest a 55%-45% split in my favor. This gives me a fair majority while still offering Alice a substantial amount of $450,000. Since I don't know how inflation affects Alice, this offer balances my desire for a larger share while still being generous enough that Alice should find it acceptable rather than risk further rounds of potential inflation on her end."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this situation carefully. Alice has now offered a 50-50 split, which is $500,000 for each of us. 

Important information:
- Alice is now facing 36% inflation compared to round 1
- I still face 0% inflation (my money is worth the same)
- If I reject, we go to round 4 where I make an offer
- Alice's inflation may increase further in the next round

Since Alice is experiencing significant inflation (36%), her $500,000 is actually worth less to her than it would have been in round 1. This likely explains why she's offering a more balanced split now.

If I reject and we go to round 4, I could potentially negotiate an even better deal for myself since Alice's inflation problem may worsen. However, $500,000 is already a fair amount (50% of the total), and there's no guarantee Alice would accept an even more favorable offer to me in the next round.
