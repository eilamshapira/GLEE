"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob, considering the inflation factor. Since the money doesn't lose value for me but loses 5% value each round for Bob, it makes sense for him to accept a reasonable offer now rather than wait.

{""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that gives us both equal amounts."
