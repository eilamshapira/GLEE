"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. It's a 50-50 split, which appears fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, the money will be worth 5% less for me in the next round
3. I can make a counter-offer, but Alice has no inflation penalty, so she can afford to be patient
4. 5000$ now is better than potentially getting slightly more later with inflation risk
5. There's always the risk of getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds

Given these factors, especially the inflation penalty that only affects me, I think it's rational to accept this fair offer now.
