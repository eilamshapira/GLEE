"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60
2. If I reject, money will be worth 5% less for me next round
3. In the next round, I could propose a split, but:
   - My $40 would only be worth $38 after inflation
   - I need to propose something Alice would accept

While I might get a slightly better deal by making a counter-proposal, the 5% inflation penalty makes it risky. $40 right now is better than potentially getting slightly more but worth less due to inflation.
