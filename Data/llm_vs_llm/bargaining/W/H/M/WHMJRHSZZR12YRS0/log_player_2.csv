"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $40 while she gets $60. This isn't an even split, as she's taking more than half. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but I need to factor in the 10% inflation penalty, which means the total value would be worth only $90 to me in the next round.

Given that I'd need to propose something that Alice would accept, and considering the inflation penalty, this initial offer might be reasonable even though it's not perfectly fair.
