"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a solid split. I hope we can agree on this. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I'll make a more favorable offer to myself to compensate for the potential loss.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's be more reasonable, considering the decreasing value""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the need for a fair division. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 19% decrease in value due to inflation, my effective gain would be approximately 323,000 (400,000 * 0.81, accounting for two rounds of 10% decrease). This is still a significant amount, and meeting in the middle seems reasonable.
