"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering inflation, my $500,000 is now worth less. Let's calculate:

*   Original value for Alice: $500,000
*   Inflation loss: 5%
*   Actual value: $500,000 \* (1 - 0.05) = $475,000

Bob's $500,000 is worth the full amount.

I need to decide if $475,000 is worth taking, and if the risk of further rounds and further inflation makes it less appealing.

I'll **accept** the offer.
