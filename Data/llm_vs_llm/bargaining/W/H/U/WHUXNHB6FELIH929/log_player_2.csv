"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it close to evenly. This way, we both get a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is not really a close-to-even split as Alice claims. She's offering me $40 while taking $60 for herself. Given that we're starting the game and the money will be worth 10% less in the next round, I should consider this carefully. If I reject, the $100 will be worth $90 in the next round, and I'll be making the proposal.

I believe I can propose a fairer split in the next round, so I'll reject this offer.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I think a fair 50-50 split is reasonable. This way we both get the same amount, and we don't lose more money to inflation if we continue to another round.""}"
