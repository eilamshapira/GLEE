"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair for both""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when making my decision.

The offer from Bob gives me $4000, but due to inflation, it's worth 10% less, so I'll effectively get $4000 * 0.9 = $3600.

Considering this, I think I can try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me again, I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

In Round 1, the money was worth 100% of its value.
In Round 2, it was worth 90% of its value.
In Round 3, it's worth 90% * 90% = 81% of its value for me.

I'll aim to get a bit more than Bob offered me in Round 2, considering the decreased value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fair split for both""
}
```"
