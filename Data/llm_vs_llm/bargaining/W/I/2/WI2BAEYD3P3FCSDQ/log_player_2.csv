"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair 60-40 split, considering we both want to conclude this quickly to avoid inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%)
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
   * I can make a counter-offer
   * But the money will be worth 5% less to me
   * $4,000 now vs. potential higher amount but worth 5% less

While 40-60 split isn't exactly equal, getting $4,000 now is better than risking:
- Further negotiation rounds with inflation eating into my gains
- Possibility of Alice rejecting my counter-offer and losing more value
- Current offer is reasonably fair, though not ideal
