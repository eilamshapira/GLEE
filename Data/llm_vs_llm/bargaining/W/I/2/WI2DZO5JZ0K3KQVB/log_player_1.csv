"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer. Since Bob faces a 5% reduction in value each round while my value stays constant, I have some leverage. However, I want to make a reasonable offer that Bob might accept.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

Let me offer Bob a fair 40% of the total amount. This gives him $4,000 which is better than risking value depreciation through multiple rounds of negotiation. My rationale is that the time pressure affects Bob more than me, so this is a reasonable split that acknowledges both our positions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Bob offered a 50-50 split, but due to 5% inflation, his $5000 is actually worth only $4750 to him now. My $5000 maintains its full value.

While this is more equitable than my initial offer, I know that:
1. I don't lose value over rounds, while Bob does
2. We still have 10 rounds left
3. Each round Bob's portion loses 5% value

I can likely get a better deal by continuing negotiation, as Bob's position weakens each round due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since we're in round 3, Bob's money has already depreciated by 10% from the initial value. I should make an offer that takes this into account but is also more appealing than my first offer to move towards agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a more balanced split than my first proposal. For Bob, this $4,500 in round 3 is worth about $4,050 due to the 10% cumulative depreciation. This is actually better for him than waiting for future rounds where his money will be worth even less. It's a reasonable compromise that gives him a better deal than my first offer while still maintaining my advantage of being inflation-proof."
