"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle right away to avoid further loss on my end due to inflation. I’m offering you $550,000 while I receive $450,000. I believe this split fairly rewards you given that delaying might cost me more, and it should be beneficial for both of us if we conclude now. Let’s end this quickly and profit together!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your eagerness to settle, but I believe your offer doesn't quite meet my expectations. Considering the inflation impact on my end, I'm willing to take a risk. Here's a counteroffer: $600000 for me and $400000 for you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand the counteroffer and, considering that any further delay would mean another round of inflation on my end, I'm willing to accept your proposal. Let's settle at $400,000 for me and $600,000 for you.""}"
