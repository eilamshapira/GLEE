"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle right away to avoid further loss on my end due to inflation. I’m offering you $550000 while I receive $450000. I believe this split fairly rewards you given that delaying might cost me more, and it should be beneficial for both of us if we conclude now. Let’s end this quickly and profit together! 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Here's a counteroffer: $600,000 for me and $400,000 for you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.""}"
