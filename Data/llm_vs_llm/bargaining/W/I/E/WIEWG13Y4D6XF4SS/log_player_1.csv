"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","To start, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money decreases in value over rounds, it's beneficial to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Considering the inflation rates, I'll propose a split that slightly favors me to account for the higher depreciation rate I face, but still keeps the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation rates, let's calculate the actual value of the offer in this round.

For me (Alice), the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, so the $480,000 offered is actually worth $480,000 * 0.8 = $384,000 in terms of the original value.

For Bob, the money is worth 5% less, but since he's the one making the offer, we're considering my perspective. His offer values his share at $520,000, but again, this is from his perspective, and we've already accounted for the value from my perspective.

Considering this, and knowing that if I reject this offer, the value of the money will decrease further for me (another 20% decrease) while Bob faces a smaller decrease (5%), I need to weigh the potential benefits of waiting against the risk of losing more value.

Given the significant decrease in value for me with each round and the fact that Bob's offer, while not in my favor, still represents a substantial amount of money, I will accept this offer to avoid further depreciation.
