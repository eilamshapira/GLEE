Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

For me (Bob), the money is now worth 95% of its original value, so $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000.
For Alice, the money is now worth 80% of its original value, so $1,000,000 * 0.80 = $800,000.

Considering this, I'll make an offer that favors me slightly, but still gives Alice a significant amount.
