"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Let me think strategically. Since Bob's money loses 5% value each round and mine doesn't, Bob has an incentive to accept earlier rather than later. I'll start with a somewhat favorable split for me, but not too extreme.

{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm offering you a fair 40% share. Remember that if you reject, your money will be worth 5% less next round, while mine keeps its value. This is a good deal for you.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more fairly. This is a better deal for both of us. Don't forget, the money is losing value for me with each round! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob is offering me $450,000, which is worth full value to me
2. If I reject, we go to round 3 where I can make an offer, but Bob's money will be worth another 5% less
3. While I could reject and try to get more, there's a risk of losing rounds and potentially getting nothing if we reach round 12
4. $450,000 is a reasonable share, and I don't lose any value to inflation
