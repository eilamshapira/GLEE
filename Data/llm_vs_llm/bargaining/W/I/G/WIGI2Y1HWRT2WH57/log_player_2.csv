"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a fair 40% share. Remember that if you reject, your money will be worth 5% less next round, while mine keeps its value. This is a good deal for you. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice's offer gives me 40% of the total amount, which is $400,000, I should consider whether this is a fair deal. Given that the money will be worth 5% less for me in each subsequent round, I should weigh the potential benefits of rejecting the offer against the risk of losing value.

However, 40% seems a bit low, considering I have the power to reject and propose a counteroffer in the next round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the money is now worth 5% less to me, but I still have the full $1,000,000 as the base amount for my proposal. I'll make a counteroffer that splits the money more evenly.

My offer: I'll take 55% of the $1,000,000, and Alice can have the remaining 45%.

Here's my proposal in JSON format:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it more fairly. This is a better deal for both of us. Don't forget, the money is losing value for me with each round!""}"
