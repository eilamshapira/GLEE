525000.0,475000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money in a way that acknowledges the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. I'm offering you a generous $475000 (47.5%) while I take $525000 (52.5%). This is fair because if we go to another round, the total value decreases for me but not for you, so we both benefit by agreeing now.",Alice,1,

510000.0,490000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your position on the inflation penalty. I'm proposing a slightly more even split of $490000 for me and $510000 for you. This recognizes the time pressure you face while still being a good deal for both of us.",Bob,2,
