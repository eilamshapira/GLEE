"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money in a way that acknowledges the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. I'm offering you a generous $475,000 (47.5%) while I take $525,000 (52.5%). This is fair because if we go to another round, the total value decreases for me but not for you, so we both benefit by agreeing now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position on the inflation penalty. I'm proposing a slightly more even split of $490000 for me and $510000 for you. This recognizes the time pressure you face while still being a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
