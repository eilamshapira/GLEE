"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money in a way that acknowledges the 5% inflation penalty I face each round. I'm offering you a generous $475000 (47.5%) while I take $525000 (52.5%). This is fair because if we go to another round, the total value decreases for me but not for you, so we both benefit by agreeing now. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
