"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. It's a $4500/$5500 split
2. This is fairly close to a 50/50 split (45%/55%)
3. It's the first round, and we have 11 more rounds to go
4. But there's no inflation for me, so waiting doesn't cost me anything
5. I could try to negotiate for a more favorable split
6. However, there's some risk in negotiating further if we can't reach an agreement in 12 rounds

While the offer is reasonable, since there's no inflation penalty for me and we have many rounds left, I think I can try to negotiate for a slightly better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's fairly reasonable first offer, I should propose something that's also reasonable but slightly more in my favor. I'll propose a 50/50 split, which is fair and slightly better than her original offer.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal split of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is now offering me less than her first offer ($4000 vs $4500)
2. She's asking for more ($6000 vs $5500) despite facing 36% inflation
3. Her $6000 is actually worth only $3840 to her due to the 36% inflation
4. The money's value hasn't changed for me
5. This offer is worse for me than both her first offer and my counter-offer
6. We still have 9 rounds left

Since this offer is worse than her first offer and the money maintains its value for me, I should reject this and try to negotiate a better deal. There's no pressure on my side from inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me think strategically:

1. Alice has rejected a 50/50 split
2. She's facing significant inflation (36% last round)
3. She might be more willing to accept a reasonable offer now due to inflation
4. However, being too aggressive might lead to continued rejection
5. I should offer something between our last positions

I'll propose a split that's slightly better than her first offer but not as aggressive as demanding half:

{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300}

This offer gives Alice more than she'd effectively get from her last proposal (due to inflation), while improving my position slightly from her first offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's $5800 is now worth only $2374 to her (after 59.04% inflation)
2. She's still demanding more than half despite severe inflation on her side
3. She's offering me $4200, which is less than her first offer ($4500)
4. My money maintains its full value
5. We still have 7 rounds left
6. The inflation she's facing is getting quite severe

Given that:
- Her offer is worse for me than her first offer
- I have no inflation pressure
- She's facing increasingly severe inflation
- We have several rounds left

It would be strategic to reject this offer and wait for a better one, as her position is weakening due to inflation while mine remains strong.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me strategize:

1. Alice is facing severe inflation (59.04% last round)
2. She's still been resistant to accepting offers despite this
3. She might be playing tough, but her position is weakening significantly
4. I can afford to be a bit firmer as I have no inflation pressure
5. However, I don't want to be so aggressive that she continues rejecting

Given her weakening position but continued resistance, I'll make a slightly more assertive offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm returning to the 50/50 split because:
1. It's objectively fair
2. With her severe inflation, her effective gain would be much lower if she continues to delay
3. It's a clear signal that this is a reasonable position I'm willing to maintain
4. She might be more willing to accept now given the inflation pressure"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. This is Alice's best offer so far ($4700 for me)
2. Her inflation is now severe at 73.79%
3. Her $5300 is only worth $1389 to her after inflation
4. This matches my previous offer to her from round 4
5. My money maintains full value
6. We still have 5 rounds left

While this is her best offer yet, given that:
- I face no inflation pressure
- She's facing extreme inflation (73.79%)
- Her position is significantly weakened
- We still have several rounds left
- I can still get a better deal

I will reject this offer and continue negotiating for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me strategize:

1. Alice is now facing severe inflation (73.79% last round)
2. She's finally started making better offers (her last was $4700 to me)
3. But her position is extremely weak due to inflation
4. I have no inflation pressure at all
5. We still have 4 rounds after this one
6. She should be highly motivated to reach a deal soon

Given her severely weakened position, I can afford to be more assertive:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This offer is reasonable because:
1. Her $4500 now is better than waiting and getting more nominal money that's worth much less due to inflation
2. It's still giving her a significant portion
3. Given her severe inflation, she should recognize that delaying further will only hurt her more
4. The split is not so extreme as to appear unfair"
