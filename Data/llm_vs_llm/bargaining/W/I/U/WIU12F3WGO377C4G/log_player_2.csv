"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both get an equal share. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, the total amount will decrease to $9500 in the next round
4. This means even if I got a better percentage next round, the absolute amount might be less
5. A 50-50 split is generally considered fair
6. Getting $5000 now is better than risking a lower amount due to inflation
