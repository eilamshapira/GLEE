"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of $10,000, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me each round. I want to make an offer that is likely to be accepted by Bob, while still maximizing my gain, especially considering the diminishing value of the money over time for me.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

Rationale:

*   **Slightly Favoring Alice:** I'm giving myself a slightly larger share, reflecting the advantage of being the first proposer and factoring in the future inflation.
*   **Acceptable to Bob:** I'm still offering Bob a significant amount ($4500), which should be attractive enough for him to accept, especially early in the game when all the money is still available.
*   **Early Advantage:** Securing a good amount early on is beneficial because its value is highest now, before inflation significantly erodes it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's counter-offer. Let's analyze the situation:

*   **Bob's Offer:** 5000 for me, 5000 for him.
*   **Inflation Impact on Me:** The money I would gain now is worth 10% less than in round 1. So, $5000 now is equivalent to $4500 in round 1 money.
*   **Inflation Impact on Bob:** The money Bob would gain now is worth 5% less than in round 1.
*   **Alternatives:** If I reject, I become the proposer next round, but the money will be worth even less.

Decision: Even though Bob's offer isn't ideal, taking the inflation into account, $5000 with 10% less worth is still an acceptable deal. It is risky to reject and hope for a better offer next round.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
