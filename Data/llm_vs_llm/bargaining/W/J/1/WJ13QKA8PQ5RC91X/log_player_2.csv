"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $30 while she gets $70 out of the $100. If I reject, I'll make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me (so the $100 would effectively be worth $80 to me), while for Alice it would only be worth 5% less.

Given the significant inflation difference between us, I need to be strategic, but I also shouldn't accept too unfavorable an offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more balanced offer considering our different inflation rates. Since money devalues faster for me than for Alice, we should reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}

I propose a 45-55 split which is much more equitable than the previous offer. Since we both face inflation (mine at 20% and yours at 5%), it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement quickly rather than letting the value diminish further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice has slightly improved her offer from $30 to $35, but we're now in round 3, and inflation has significantly affected the value for me.

With 36% inflation for me, a $35 gain would actually be worth $35 Ã— 0.64 = $22.40 in round 1 terms.

If I reject and we continue to round 4, my inflation will increase further, while Alice's inflation rate grows more slowly. This asymmetric inflation means delaying agreement is costlier for me than for Alice.

Given this dynamic, and that Alice has moved somewhat in my direction:
