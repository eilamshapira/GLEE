"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because I face a 5% penalty each round, while you don't lose value. Let's make a deal now and both benefit.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your situation, but I believe a 55-45 split in my favor is more equitable, considering you lose 5% each round while my share remains unaffected by inflation. Let's settle this now to avoid further losses for you. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since I can still achieve a better outcome even with the 5% penalty. The current value of my potential $4500 after one round of inflation is $4275, which is significantly less than what I could get with a more balanced proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Bob, let's meet in the middle. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. With the 10% value I've already lost due to inflation, this is actually a very fair deal for you. Further delays will only make it harder to reach an agreement that benefits us both.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. Let's settle for a 52-48 split in my favor. This way, you'll still get a fair share considering the value loss you've already incurred. It's important we reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer. With the current 14.26% inflation penalty, my $4800 would be worth approximately $4116. If I reject and continue negotiating, the increasing inflation penalty would likely result in a worse outcome for me, even if I could negotiate a nominally higher amount. This is a reasonable compromise given the circumstances."
