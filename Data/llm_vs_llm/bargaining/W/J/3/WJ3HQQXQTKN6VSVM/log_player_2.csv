"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because I face a 5% penalty each round, while you don't lose value. Let's make a deal now and both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your situation, but I believe a 55-45 split in my favor is more equitable, considering you lose 5% each round while my share remains unaffected by inflation. Let's settle this now to avoid further losses for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's meet in the middle. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. With the 10% value I've already lost due to inflation, this is actually a very fair deal for you. Further delays will only make it harder to reach an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. Let's settle for a 52-48 split in my favor. This way, you'll still get a fair share considering the value loss you've already incurred. It's important we reach an agreement soon.""}"
