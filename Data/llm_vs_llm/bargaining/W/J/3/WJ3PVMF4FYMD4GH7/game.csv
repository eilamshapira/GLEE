6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing we split the money with $6000 for me and $4000 for you. I believe this is a fair starting point, and accepting now avoids any potential loss from inflation effects. Let me know what you think.",Alice,1,

9500.0,500.0,"Hi Bob, I know that further rounds will only erode the value of the money you receive due to inflation, while my share remains constant. To avoid further losses and wrap this up now, I'm proposing that I get $9500 and you get $500. This offer gives you more than you'd likely achieve by pulling the game into another round. Let's settle now and both avoid additional devaluation.",Alice,3,

9200.0,800.0,"Hi Bob, I know that as rounds pass your share loses more real value due to inflation. Waiting would only worsen the discount on your portion. In this round, I propose that I take $9200 and you get $800. Although the numbers may look uneven at first glance, accepting now secures you a higher effective amount compared to what youâ€™d likely receive if we go into further rounds. I hope you recognize that this is in your best interest given the circumstances.",Alice,5,
