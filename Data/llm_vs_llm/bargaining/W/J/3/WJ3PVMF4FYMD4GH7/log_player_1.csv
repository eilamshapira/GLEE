Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 9200, ""bob_gain"": 800, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I know that as rounds pass your share loses more real value due to inflation. Waiting would only worsen the discount on your portion. In this round, I propose that I take $9200 and you get $800. Although the numbers may look uneven at first glance, accepting now secures you a higher effective amount compared to what youâ€™d likely receive if we go into further rounds. I hope you recognize that this is in your best interest given the circumstances.""}"
