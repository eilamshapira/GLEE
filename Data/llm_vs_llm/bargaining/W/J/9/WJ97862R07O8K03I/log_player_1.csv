"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that considers our fair interests, as well as the fact that Bob faces a 10% inflation penalty per round while I don't.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because it's reasonably fair while giving me a slight advantage. I recognize that if Bob rejects, he'll be making the next offer, but under the influence of a 10% inflation penalty for him. This gives me some leverage, but I don't want to be too greedy as that might lead to rejection and further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll adjust my offer considering the inflation penalty Bob faces and our negotiation so far.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm offering a more balanced split that's favorable to both of us. Since Bob now faces a 20% inflation penalty if we go to the next round, it's in his interest to accept a reasonable offer now. This proposal gives him a better real value than if we continue negotiating, while still providing me with a fair share."
