"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Let me propose a fair split while considering the different inflation rates we face.

{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I'm offering you $40 because if you reject, the money will be worth less for both of us in the next round. This is a fair split considering our different inflation rates.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally. Even with the inflation, this is a fair deal for both of us. If we proceed to the next round, the money will be worth even less for you. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $50 but it's worth 20% less than first round value, so effectively $40
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, the value will decrease another 20% for me
- Given the higher inflation rate I face (20% vs Bob's 5%), delaying further puts me at a disadvantage
- The equal split, even with inflation, still gives me a reasonable amount
