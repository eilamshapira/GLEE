"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I understand that we need to divide $10,000, and that with each passing round, the money is worth the same to me but loses 10% of its value for Bob. This creates an incentive for Bob to accept earlier rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fair split considering the 10% inflation that affects only you. If we go to another round, the $10,000 will be worth less to you, so this is actually a generous first offer.""}"
