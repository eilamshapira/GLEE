"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose taking $55 for myself and giving $45 to Bob. This is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a substantial portion while maintaining fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because even with the 10% inflation reducing my $100 to an effective value of $90, this is still significantly better than any future negotiations where inflation will reduce the value further. Getting $90 in effective value is better than the $55 I originally proposed, and any future round would mean even more value lost to inflation."
