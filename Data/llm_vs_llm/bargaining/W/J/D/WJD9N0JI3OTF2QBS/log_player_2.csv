Explanation: When it’s my (Bob’s) turn in round 2, I must consider that every delay further devalues my money (a 5% loss per round) while I’m uncertain about Alice’s discounting. Rationally, if I try to claim any portion for myself now, Alice—who might not be affected by inflation at all—can simply reject my offer and then, as the proposer in round 3, structure a deal that essentially gives her nearly all of the $100. Thus, to make her at least indifferent between accepting now and waiting to propose in round 3, I must offer her nearly the whole pie. In equilibrium, given that her continuation value (by waiting) is essentially $100, the only proposal that makes her accept in round 2 is the one where I take nothing and she gets all $100."
