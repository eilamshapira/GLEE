"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that this is Round 1 and with 20% inflation per round, I need to consider if this offer is reasonable or if I should counter.

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total amount. If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value to me will be worth 20% less, so the full amount would only be worth $800,000 to me. Even if I were to get a larger percentage in the next round, I need to weigh that against this immediate offer.

Since this is a reasonable first offer and the declining value due to inflation makes waiting risky, I'll accept.
