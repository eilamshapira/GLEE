"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Currently offered: $40 for me, $60 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to inflation:
   - Next round my money will be worth 10% less
   - Alice's money will be worth 20% less
   - So if I get $40 now, it's better than getting $44-45 next round (because of the 10% devaluation)
   - And Alice's $60 now is better than getting $72-75 next round (due to 20% devaluation)

The offer is not ideal, but considering the inflation penalty, it's reasonable enough. If I reject, I might end up with less actual value after inflation.
