"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a slightly more balanced split would be fair given that we both face inflation. I'm proposing 52 for me and 48 for you. Let's wrap this up and avoid further losses! 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
