"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Alice, and I want to maximize my gain while considering the inflation effect and the limited number of rounds. Given that it's the first round, I'll start with a relatively generous offer to increase the chances of Bob accepting.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob rejected my initial offer and has now proposed a split where he gets $600,000 and I get $400,000. I need to consider the inflation. Since this is round 2, my money is worth 5% less than in round 1.

Let's calculate the present value of Bob's offer to me:

$400,000 * (1 - 0.05) = $400,000 * 0.95 = $380,000

Getting $380,000 equivalent now is better than risking a worse deal later with more inflation eating away at the potential reward. While I don't like the split, I'm going to accept this offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
