"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll formulate an offer that acknowledges both of our interests while considering the inflation factor.

{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since the money devalues 10% for you each round but not for me, it's in your interest to accept sooner rather than later. This 60/40 split gives you more value now than waiting for a potentially better offer later when your money will be worth less.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the devaluation situation.  While your previous offer was tempting, I'm hoping we can find a slightly more equitable split. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
