"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since the money devalues 10% for you each round but not for me, it's in your interest to accept sooner rather than later. This 60/40 split gives you more value now than waiting for a potentially better offer later when your money will be worth less. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
