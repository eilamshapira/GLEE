"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer for round 1.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a fair division that gives both of us a substantial amount, with a slight advantage to me since I'm making the first offer and facing inflation pressure in future rounds."
