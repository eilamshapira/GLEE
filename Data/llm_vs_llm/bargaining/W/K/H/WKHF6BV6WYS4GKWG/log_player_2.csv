"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is suggesting I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000 out of the $10,000 total. If I reject, I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation.

Given the inflation penalty and the uncertainty about how inflation affects Alice, this first offer is not terrible, but I believe I can negotiate for a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counteroffer that's more balanced while acknowledging the inflation risk I face.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is fair to both of us and ensures we both benefit equally from resolving this quickly before inflation reduces the value further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice has increased my share slightly from $4,000 to $4,200, while reducing her share from $6,000 to $5,800. However, I've now learned important information - inflation affects me but not Alice. This gives her a significant advantage in later rounds.

Due to the 19% inflation I've experienced, the $4,200 is actually worth about $3,402 in round 1 value to me. If I reject and we continue to later rounds, my negotiating position will get worse as inflation continues to erode my value while Alice is unaffected.

Given this asymmetric inflation and the fact that Alice slightly improved her offer, I should accept.
