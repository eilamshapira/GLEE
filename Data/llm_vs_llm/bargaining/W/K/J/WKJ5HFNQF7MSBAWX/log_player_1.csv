"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to Bob in the first round, considering the 5% inflation penalty for each passing round for me.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest this fair division because we both deserve a reasonable share. Since I face a 5% penalty per round while Bob doesn't, it makes sense to reach an agreement quickly. I'm proposing slightly more for myself since I'm making the first offer, but I believe this is a balanced split that respects both our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, considering we're now in round 3 and the inflation effect is increasing for me.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm adjusting my offer to be more favorable to Bob compared to my first proposal. Since we're already in round 3 and I face a 10% total inflation penalty so far, it's important that we reach an agreement soon. This is a fair compromise that gives Bob a bit more while still allowing me to receive a reasonable portion."
