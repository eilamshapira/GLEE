"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50/50 split. With inflation affecting me by 5% each round, it makes sense to reach a fair agreement quickly so we both benefit optimally. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering Bob's message and the effect of inflation on his gain, I think a 50/50 split is reasonable. It's a fair proposal, and it's in my best interest to accept it before the inflation affects Bob's gain even more, which could lead to him making a less favorable offer in the next round.
