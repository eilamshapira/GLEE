"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering a 60/40 split where she would get $600,000 and I would get $400,000. Given that the money loses 5% value for me each round, if I reject now and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will already be worth 5% less to me.

I need to consider if waiting for a potentially better deal is worth the guaranteed 5% loss in value.

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000,
