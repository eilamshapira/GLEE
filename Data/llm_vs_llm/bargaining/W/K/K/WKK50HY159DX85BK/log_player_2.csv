"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * Money will be worth 10% less to me
   * Maximum I could get would be $900,000, but worth only $810,000 due to inflation
   * Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more value loss

While $400,000 is less than half, it's still a substantial amount. Given the inflation penalty and the risk of multiple rounds of negotiation, it might be better to accept this reasonable offer rather than risk getting less value in future rounds.
