I'm starting with an offer that gives me nearly all the money.  This is to see if Bob is willing to accept a highly unequal split in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. This is a fair deal, and I'm hoping Bob recognizes the value of a fair deal rather than risking losing more money in the later rounds due to inflation."
