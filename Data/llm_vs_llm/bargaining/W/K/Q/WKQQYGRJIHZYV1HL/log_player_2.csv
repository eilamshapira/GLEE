"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit significantly. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into consideration.

In round 1, the total value for me was $1,000,000. Now, it's worth $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000 for me.
For Alice, the total value was $1,000,000. Now, it's worth $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000 for her.

Considering this, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This offer is still generous considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the decreasing value:
For me, the initial value was $1,000,000, and now it's worth $1,000,000 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = $1,000,000 * 0.857375 (approximately 14.29% less than the initial value).
For Alice, the initial value was $1,000,000, and now it's worth $1,000,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $1,000,000 * 0.512 (approximately 48.8% less than the initial value).

I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this back and forth is not beneficial for either of us. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the decreasing value:
For me, the initial value was $1,000,000, and now it's worth $1,000,000 * 0.95^5 = $1,000,000 * 0.774648 (approximately 22.53% less than the initial value).
For Alice, the initial value was $1,000,000, and now it's worth $1,000,000 * 0.8^5 = $1,000,000 * 0.32768 (approximately 67.23% less than the initial value).

I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value and the fact that Alice said her previous offer was her final one, which might not be entirely true.
