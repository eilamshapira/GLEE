5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing we split the money so we both get a fair share. I take $5500 and you get $4500. This considers our different inflation rates - yours is higher at 20%, so it makes sense to agree early. If we delay, we both lose value significantly.",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I believe a 50-50 split is fair considering we're starting a new round. My offer is $5000 for each of us. Given our different rates of inflation, it's crucial we settle soon, but I think this split respects both our needs. Let's agree on this and end the game.",Bob,2,

5300.0,4700.0,"Bob, I appreciate your 50-50 offer, but I think we should consider our different inflation rates. Your money loses value at 20% per round, while mine only at 5%. This means you're more pressured to settle quickly. I'm offering you $4700 now, which is worth more to you than waiting another round when your money will be worth significantly less. Let's settle this so we both benefit.",Alice,3,

5200.0,4800.0,"Alice, I understand the urgency due to our different inflation rates. However, I believe a slight adjustment from my last offer is fair. I propose $4800 for me and $5200 for you. This way, we both get a reasonable amount considering the rapid decrease in value for me. Let's end this now before the value drops further.",Bob,4,
