"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'm going to make an offer that considers our respective inflation rates and tries to be fair.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing we split the money so we both get a fair share. I take $5,500 and you get $4,500. This considers our different inflation rates - yours is higher at 20%, so it makes sense to agree early. If we delay, we both lose value significantly.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I believe a 50-50 split is fair considering we're starting a new round. My offer is $5000 for each of us. Given our different rates of inflation, it's crucial we settle soon, but I think this split respects both our needs. Let's agree on this and end the game. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that accounts for our inflation rates and the progressing rounds.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5300,
  ""bob_gain"": 4700,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your 50-50 offer, but I think we should consider our different inflation rates. Your money loses value at 20% per round, while mine only at 5%. This means you're more pressured to settle quickly. I'm offering you $4,700 now, which is worth more to you than waiting another round when your money will be worth significantly less. Let's settle this so we both benefit.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the urgency due to our different inflation rates. However, I believe a slight adjustment from my last offer is fair. I propose $4800 for me and $5200 for you. This way, we both get a reasonable amount considering the rapid decrease in value for me. Let's end this now before the value drops further. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800
