"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing we split the money so we both get a fair share. I take $5500 and you get $4500. This considers our different inflation rates - yours is higher at 20%, so it makes sense to agree early. If we delay, we both lose value significantly. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I believe a 50-50 split is fair considering we're starting a new round. My offer is $5,000 for each of us. Given our different rates of inflation, it's crucial we settle soon, but I think this split respects both our needs. Let's agree on this and end the game.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your 50-50 offer, but I think we should consider our different inflation rates. Your money loses value at 20% per round, while mine only at 5%. This means you're more pressured to settle quickly. I'm offering you $4700 now, which is worth more to you than waiting another round when your money will be worth significantly less. Let's settle this so we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the urgency due to our different inflation rates. However, I believe a slight adjustment from my last offer is fair. I propose $4,800 for me and $5,200 for you. This way, we both get a reasonable amount considering the rapid decrease in value for me. Let's end this now before the value drops further.""
