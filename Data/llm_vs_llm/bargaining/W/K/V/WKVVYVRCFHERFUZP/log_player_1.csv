"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose an equal 50-50 split. This is fair for both of us, and we should agree quickly since inflation is reducing the value for me by 5% each round, and may be affecting you similarly. This way we both walk away with a good deal without risking further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept now, I'll get $50 but with 20% less value = $40 effective value
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
- Even if I managed to get a better split next round (say 60-40), the 60% would be worth even less due to inflation
- $40 effective value now is better than risking further devaluation
