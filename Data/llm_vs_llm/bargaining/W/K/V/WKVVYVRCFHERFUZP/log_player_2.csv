"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid inflation eating into our gains. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether 40% of the pot is a fair deal for me, or if I should reject and make a counter-offer in the next round.

If I reject, I can make my own proposal next round, but the total money will be worth 5% less to me (so the $100 becomes effectively $95 from my perspective). This means that even if I propose a better split for myself next round, the overall value would be decreased.

For example, if I rejected and proposed a 50-50 split next round, I would get $47.50 in value (50% of $95), which is better than the current $40 offer. However, Alice might reject that offer too, leading to further inflation.

Given the uncertainty about how inflation affects Alice and the definite 5% reduction each round for me, I think I should make a counter-proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a proposal that acknowledges both our interests while being mindful of the inflation risk.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I propose an equal 50-50 split. This is fair for both of us, and we should agree quickly since inflation is reducing the value for me by 5% each round, and may be affecting you similarly. This way we both walk away with a good deal without risking further devaluation.""}"
