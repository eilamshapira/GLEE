Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 10000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5100, ""bob_gain"": 4900} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing for me rapidly. It's crucial to secure a deal soon.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob's extreme offer in Round 2 suggests he might be aiming for a highly favorable outcome.  
* **Compromise:** This offer is a significant compromise from my Round 1 offer, moving closer to a 50/50 split to increase the chances of Bob accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200 
# Bob gain: 9800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is exploitative. While I understand the pressure of inflation, accepting such a low amount sets a dangerous precedent and suggests I am desperate. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to be bullied into accepting an unfair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Inflation is severely cutting into my potential gains. I need to secure a deal quickly.
* **Shift in Strategy:** Bob seems determined to play a tough game. Offering him a larger share than before might be the only way to incentivize him to accept before the value deteriorates further.
* **Preserving Value:** While a 40/60 split isn't ideal, it's better than risking further inflation and potentially receiving even less in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is utterly demoralizing, but I have no choice. The value of the money is rapidly approaching zero for me.  Accepting even $1 is better than risking a complete loss if I reject and we reach a point where the potential gain is effectively nothing."
