400000.0,600000.0,"I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. While it's not a 50/50 split, it's a more efficient way to divide the money. Since we're moving to the next round, I believe this is a good way to incentivize us both to accept a deal.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for more than a 50-50 split, but I need to consider my interests as well. Since inflation affects you but not me, I'm proposing I get $550000 and you get $450000. This is actually favorable to you considering the inflation effect, and it allows us to conclude the deal without further devaluation of your share.",Alice,3,
