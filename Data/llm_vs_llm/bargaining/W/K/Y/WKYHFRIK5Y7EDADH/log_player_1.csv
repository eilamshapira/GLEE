"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split which seems fair to both of us. This way we both walk away with a significant amount and can finish the game quickly.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. While it's not a 50/50 split, it's a more efficient way to divide the money. Since we're moving to the next round, I believe this is a good way to incentivize us both to accept a deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for more than a 50-50 split, but I need to consider my interests as well. Since inflation affects you but not me, I'm proposing I get $550,000 and you get $450,000. This is actually favorable to you considering the inflation effect, and it allows us to conclude the deal without further devaluation of your share.""
