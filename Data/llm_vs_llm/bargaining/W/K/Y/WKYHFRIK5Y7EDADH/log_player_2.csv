Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split which seems fair to both of us. This way we both walk away with a significant amount and can finish the game quickly. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. While it's not a 50/50 split, it's a more efficient way to divide the money. Since we're moving to the next round, I believe this is a good way to incentivize us both to accept a deal.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for more than a 50-50 split, but I need to consider my interests as well. Since inflation affects you but not me, I'm proposing I get $550000 and you get $450000. This is actually favorable to you considering the inflation effect, and it allows us to conclude the deal without further devaluation of your share. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
