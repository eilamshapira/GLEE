"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Let me think through this. We need to divide $10,000 between Bob and myself (Alice). In each round, the money is worth the same to me, but its value decreases by 20% for Bob with each round. This gives me a strategic advantage in later rounds since Bob will be more eager to accept any offer as the rounds progress.

I'll offer a fair split in the first round with a clear message about the inflation dynamic.

{""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I'm offering an equal split. Consider that your money loses 20% value each round, so this is the best value you'll get. If we reach later rounds, I'll need to adjust the split to account for your inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a $6000/$4000 split. Since my value decreases by 20% each round, I believe this accounts fairly for the inflation effect on my side. This way, we can both secure a good amount now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I need to be strategic here. Bob is already feeling the inflation pressure, with his money now worth 80% of the original value after two rounds. By round 3, his $10,000 would only be worth $6,400 in round 1 value. I can leverage this to get a better split.

{""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, after 2 rounds, your $4000 is actually worth $2,560 in round 1 value due to the 40% cumulative inflation. My offer gives you more real value than your previous offer would give me. If we continue to later rounds, your money will be worth even less, so this is a reasonable deal for both of us.""}"
