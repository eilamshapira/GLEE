"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering an equal split. Consider that your money loses 20% value each round, so this is the best value you'll get. If we reach later rounds, I'll need to adjust the split to account for your inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a $6000/$4000 split. Since my value decreases by 20% each round, I believe this accounts fairly for the inflation effect on my side. This way, we can both secure a good amount now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, after 2 rounds, your $4000 is actually worth $2560 in round 1 value due to the 40% cumulative inflation. My offer gives you more real value than your previous offer would give me. If we continue to later rounds, your money will be worth even less, so this is a reasonable deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
