"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a split that accounts for the different inflation rates we face, aiming for a fair solution that Bob should find acceptable.

{""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Given that you face higher inflation (10%) than I do (5%), this split is fair and we should agree quickly to maximize value for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a more balanced split is fair. While I do face higher inflation, the initial split should be more equitable. This offer still gives you a good value considering your lower inflation rate. If we continue negotiating, we both lose value, so accepting this balanced offer now maximizes our collective outcome. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob is offering me $490,000, which due to 5% inflation is now worth $465,500
2. If I reject and we continue, further rounds will decrease value for both of us
3. The split is reasonably close to 50-50
4. Bob makes a valid point about maximizing collective outcome
5. We could lose more value by continuing to negotiate
