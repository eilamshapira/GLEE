"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given that you face higher inflation (10%) than I do (5%), this split is fair and we should agree quickly to maximize value for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $450,000 while she gets $550,000, arguing that this is fair because I face higher inflation (10% per round) than she does (5% per round).

Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $450,000
- If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value decreases by 10% for me
- By waiting, I'd need to secure more than $500,000 ($450,000 รท 0.9) in the next round to make it worthwhile

Since I can make a counter-offer next round and potentially get more than what Alice is offering now (even accounting for inflation), I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced offer that accounts for the inflation differences while being more equitable.

{""bob_gain"": 510000, 
""alice_gain"": 490000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a more balanced split is fair. While I do face higher inflation, the initial split should be more equitable. This offer still gives you a good value considering your lower inflation rate. If we continue negotiating, we both lose value, so accepting this balanced offer now maximizes our collective outcome.""}"
