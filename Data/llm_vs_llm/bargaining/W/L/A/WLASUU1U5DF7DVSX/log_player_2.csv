"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. This is a 40-60 split in Alice's favor
3. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less next round, so my next potential gain would need to be higher than $4,000 to be worthwhile
4. I still have 11 rounds left, but the value keeps decreasing
5. 40% is not a terrible offer for the first round, but I think I can get a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face:

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""A fair 50-50 split is best for both of us. Remember, delay costs us both due to inflation.""}

This offer is fair because:
1. It's an equal split which is the most objective solution
2. Alice knows I'm affected by inflation, so delaying further would hurt me
3. The offer shows I'm reasonable and willing to compromise from my initial rejection
4. A 50-50 split is a common solution in negotiation games like this"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, 58-42 is more than fair now 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has offered me $4,200, but due to 36% inflation, it's actually worth $2,688 to me (4200 * 0.64)
2. Her first offer of $4,000 was worth $4,000 to me
3. This offer is actually worse for me than her first offer due to inflation
4. Alice seems to be revealing information - she's affected by less inflation than I am
5. If I reject, the next round will have even more inflation (48% less value for me)
6. I'm in a weakening position due to the asymmetric inflation

Given that:
- My bargaining power is decreasing faster than Alice's
- Future rounds will be worth even less to me
- Alice knows she can wait me out due to the inflation difference
- We've already used 3 of 12 rounds

{""decision"": ""accept""}

Better to take this offer now than risk getting even less value in future rounds."
