"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose an equal 50-50 split. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with significant value. Given that inflation affects me more severely (20% vs your 10%), we should reach agreement quickly, and an equal split seems the most reasonable way forward. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
