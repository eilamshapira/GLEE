"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. This offer gives you a substantial amount while ensuring we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000.

Given that inflation affects me more severely (20% per round vs her 10%), there's an incentive to reach agreement sooner rather than later. However, I should also ensure I'm getting a fair deal.

If I reject now, I can make a counteroffer in round 2, but my purchasing power will be reduced by 20% and Alice's by only 10%. This differential inflation puts me at a disadvantage the longer we negotiate.

Since this is just the first round and Alice's initial offer gives her a significantly larger share (60% vs my 40%), I believe I can secure a better deal by making a counteroffer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that acknowledges our different inflation rates while seeking a more balanced split.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,

""message"": ""Alice, I propose an equal 50-50 split. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with significant value. Given that inflation affects me more severely (20% vs your 10%), we should reach agreement quickly, and an equal split seems the most reasonable way forward.""}"
