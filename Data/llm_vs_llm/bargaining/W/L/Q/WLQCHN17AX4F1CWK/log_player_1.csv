"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll play as Alice and make my first offer to divide the $1,000,000.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I suggest we split the money with me receiving $550,000 and you receiving $450,000. This is a fair division that slightly favors me as the first mover, but still gives you a substantial portion. Given that inflation will reduce the value of my share by 20% each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
