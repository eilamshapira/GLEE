50.0,50.0,"I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. We both face inflation (5% for me, 10% for you), so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement soon. This equal division respects both our positions.",Bob,2,

60.0,40.0,Round 3: Inflation is hurting us both. I'm increasing my share slightly to account for my higher inflation rate. Let's settle this!,Alice,3,

52.0,48.0,"Alice, I'm meeting you in the middle. Your first offer was 45-55, but then you reduced my share to 40-60. I understand you face higher inflation (10% vs my 5% per round), but that's precisely why we should agree soon. This 48-52 split acknowledges your higher inflation rate with a slight advantage to you, while still being fair to both of us. Let's agree and stop losing value.",Bob,4,
