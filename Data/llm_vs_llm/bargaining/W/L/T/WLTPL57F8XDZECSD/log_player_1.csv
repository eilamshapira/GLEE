Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. We both face inflation (5% for me, 10% for you), so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement soon. This equal division respects both our positions.

# Bob gain: 50

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm meeting you in the middle. Your first offer was 45-55, but then you reduced my share to 40-60. I understand you face higher inflation (10% vs my 5% per round), but that's precisely why we should agree soon. This 48-52 split acknowledges your higher inflation rate with a slight advantage to you, while still being fair to both of us. Let's agree and stop losing value.

# Bob gain: 48
