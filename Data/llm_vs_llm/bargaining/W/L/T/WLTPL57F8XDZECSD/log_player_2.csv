"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Round 1: Fair split, let's start with a good offer! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer isn't an even 50-50 split, it's fairly reasonable. I need to consider that if I reject, we move to the next round where inflation will reduce the value of the money for both of us (5% for me, 10% for Alice). If I make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it too, and we could lose more value in subsequent rounds.

Let me analyze: If I accept now, I get $45. If I reject and try for a better deal next round, the $100 will be worth 5% less to me, so the maximum I could get would be $95. But Alice might not accept an offer that's too favorable to me, and we could end up with nothing if we go through all rounds.

Given this is just the first round and Alice's offer isn't terrible, I'll reject and make a counter-offer in the next round.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation factors for both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. We both face inflation (5% for me, 10% for you), so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement soon. This equal division respects both our positions.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Round 3: Inflation is hurting us both. I'm increasing my share slightly to account for my higher inflation rate. Let's settle this! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has actually decreased my share from her initial offer of $45 to $40, while increasing her share from $55 to $60. She claims this is due to her higher inflation rate, but that reasoning doesn't make much sense - if she's experiencing higher inflation, that would be an argument for accepting deals quickly, not for taking a larger share.

The inflation has already reduced the value of the money for both of us. For me, the $40 offer is now worth only about $36.10 (due to 9.75% inflation). If I reject and we move to round 4, inflation will increase further.

However, I still think we can reach a more equitable agreement. Since Alice rejected a fair 50-50 split, I'll reject this reduced offer.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, 
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm meeting you in the middle. Your first offer was 45-55, but then you reduced my share to 40-60. I understand you face higher inflation (10% vs my 5% per round), but that's precisely why we should agree soon. This 48-52 split acknowledges your higher inflation rate with a slight advantage to you, while still being fair to both of us. Let's agree and stop losing value.""}"
