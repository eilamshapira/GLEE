"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's go for a 60/40 split in my favor. I think it's a fair proposal since I'm making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me, $600,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, in the next round the money will be worth 10% less to me
4. So if I reject, my $400,000 purchasing power would become $360,000 in the next round
5. This means I'd need to secure at least $444,444 in the next round just to break even
6. Given that Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to even more rounds and inflation, this is risky

While 40/60 isn't ideal, the inflation penalty makes rejecting quite risky. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
