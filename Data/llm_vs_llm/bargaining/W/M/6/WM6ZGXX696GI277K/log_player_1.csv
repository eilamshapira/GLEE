"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a larger share, but the longer we wait, the less value the money holds for me. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This ensures we both leave with a respectable amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
