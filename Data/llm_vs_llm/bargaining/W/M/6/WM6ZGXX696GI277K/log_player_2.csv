"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a larger share, but the longer we wait, the less value the money holds for me. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This ensures we both leave with a respectable amount.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we both want to secure a good portion of the money. I'm proposing a 57/43 split in my favor. This is a compromise considering the inflation is working against you, and it's more agreeable than your previous offer. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** My potential earnings are decreasing with each round. Accepting now cuts my losses.
* **Future Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. She might even propose something worse.
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  Alice is acknowledging the impact of inflation, even if her offer doesn't fully compensate for it. 

Accepting a 43% share now (which still amounts to a significant sum) is preferable to risking a worse outcome later."
