"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $1,000,000 with Bob, considering that for him, the money loses 5% of its value each round.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split of the $1,000,000. Since we're in the first round, this gives Bob the full value of his share without any inflation penalty. This seems like a reasonable starting point that respects both of our interests equally."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer considering the inflation dynamics and the negotiation so far.

{""alice_gain"": 485000, ""bob_gain"": 515000}

I'm offering Bob $515,000, which is slightly less than he asked for in the previous round but still more than my original 50-50 split. Since we're now in round 3, Bob's money would be worth about 10% less due to inflation if we continue to round 4. By accepting this offer now, Bob would get more real value than if we continue negotiating further. This compromise seems fair given our respective positions."
