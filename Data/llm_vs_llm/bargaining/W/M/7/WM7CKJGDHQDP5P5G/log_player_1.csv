Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can come to a better agreement, Alice. Let's split it more fairly. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe this is a fair split. Let's settle this before the value drops even further. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This offer is now barely above my initial offer to Bob after three rounds of inflation. It's unlikely I can get a better deal than this considering the rapid devaluation and Bob's apparent willingness to let it continue."
