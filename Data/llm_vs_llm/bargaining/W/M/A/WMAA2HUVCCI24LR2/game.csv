40.0,60.0,"Alice, inflation is hurting us both. Let's take this deal: $60 for me and $40 for you. That's a solid deal for you, considering the increasing inflation!",Bob,2,

48.0,52.0,"Hi Bob, inflation is biting us hard as we delay. At this point, my share is already worth 10% less than at the start. To stop further losses on both sides, I'm proposing a quick settlement: you get $52 and I get $48. This gives you a slight edge to offset the heavy inflation effects you might be facing, and ensures we both preserve more value overall. Let's wrap this up now.",Alice,3,
