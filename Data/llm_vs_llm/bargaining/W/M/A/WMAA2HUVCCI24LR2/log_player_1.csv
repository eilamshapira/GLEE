"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $55 while you receive $45. I believe this is a fair offer to conclude the game quickly so that we both avoid the negative effects of inflation on our shares.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, inflation is hurting us both. Let's take this deal: $60 for me and $40 for you. That's a solid deal for you, considering the increasing inflation! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, inflation is biting us hard as we delay. At this point, my share is already worth 10% less than at the start. To stop further losses on both sides, I'm proposing a quick settlement: you get $52 and I get $48. This gives you a slight edge to offset the heavy inflation effects you might be facing, and ensures we both preserve more value overall. Let's wrap this up now.""}"
