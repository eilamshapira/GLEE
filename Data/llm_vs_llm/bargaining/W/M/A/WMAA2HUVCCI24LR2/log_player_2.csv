Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $55 while you receive $45. I believe this is a fair offer to conclude the game quickly so that we both avoid the negative effects of inflation on our shares.

# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, inflation is biting us hard as we delay. At this point, my share is already worth 10% less than at the start. To stop further losses on both sides, I'm proposing a quick settlement: you get $52 and I get $48. This gives you a slight edge to offset the heavy inflation effects you might be facing, and ensures we both preserve more value overall. Let's wrap this up now. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
