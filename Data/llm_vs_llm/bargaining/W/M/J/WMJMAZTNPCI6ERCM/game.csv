4000.0,6000.0,"Since money is worth less to me in each round, Iâ€™d like $6000 and you take $4000. This helps offset the drop in value I experience. Let's wrap this up quickly!",Bob,2,

4500.0,5500.0,"I understand your concern about inflation, Bob. How about I take $4500 and you take $5500? This way, you get more than half to account for the value drop, but it's still a bit more balanced than your last offer.",Alice,3,

3600.0,6400.0,"Alice, considering the 36% reduction in value for me, my offer of $6400 accounts for that loss, while still guaranteeing you a good $3600. This way, we can both move on favorably!",Bob,4,

4000.0,6000.0,"Bob, I see the value is dropping significantly for you. Let's compromise at $4000 for me and $6000 for you. This should help you offset the inflation while still keeping the split reasonable for both of us.",Alice,5,
