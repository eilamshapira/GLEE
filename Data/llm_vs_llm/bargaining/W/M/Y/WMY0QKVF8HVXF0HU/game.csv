5000.0,5000.0,I'm proposing an equal split of $5000 each. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a substantial amount without risking further devaluation through inflation.,Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"I understand you want an equal split, but I'm taking on more risk going first. Let's be fair: 60/40 split.",Bob,2,

4500.0,5500.0,"I understand your position about taking risk by going first, but with each round, inflation affects me more. This 45/55 split is a fair compromise that acknowledges your initial risk while ensuring I don't lose too much value to inflation.",Alice,3,
