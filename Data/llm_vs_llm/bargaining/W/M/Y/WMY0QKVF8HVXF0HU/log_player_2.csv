Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position about taking risk by going first, but with each round, inflation affects me more. This 45/55 split is a fair compromise that acknowledges your initial risk while ensuring I don't lose too much value to inflation.

# Alice gain: 4500
