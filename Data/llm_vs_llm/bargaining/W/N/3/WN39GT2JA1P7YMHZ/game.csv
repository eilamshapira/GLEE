,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. Let's settle now before further rounds erode our gains—securing value for both of us. Please consider accepting this fair offer.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, I rejected your offer because my gains are already worth less due to inflation. Let's split 65/35. It's a good deal for you considering my loss of value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but delaying the agreement will only worsen your position. With each additional round, your share's value diminishes further while mine remains stable. I'm offering you a 30% nominal slice now—by accepting, you secure your best possible outcome compared to the risk of future losses. Let's settle this before it's too late.",Bob,4,

75.0,25.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. My money is losing value fast! I need 75 now or there's no point.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
20.0,80.0,"Alice, every round you wait further diminishes the value of your share even more. Right now, I’m offering you $20 — an opportunity to secure the best possible value given the rapidly rising inflation on your side. Accepting today protects you from further losses, while any delay only makes matters worse. Let's settle now and avoid additional devaluation.",Bob,6,
