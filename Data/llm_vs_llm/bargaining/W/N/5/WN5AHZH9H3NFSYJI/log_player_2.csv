"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically.

Alice is offering me $400,000 (40%) while keeping $600,000 (60%) for herself.

If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less next round when I make a counter-offer, meaning the total value for me will be $950,000.

While I could try to negotiate for a better deal, there's risk in prolonging negotiations:
1. The 5% inflation per round significantly reduces the money's value
2. We only have 12 rounds to reach agreement
3. Alice may become less cooperative if I reject reasonable offers

$400,000 is a substantial amount, and while not perfectly equal, it's a fair enough opening offer. Given the inflation penalty and limited rounds, I think it's better to accept this decent offer rather than risk getting less through extended negotiation.
