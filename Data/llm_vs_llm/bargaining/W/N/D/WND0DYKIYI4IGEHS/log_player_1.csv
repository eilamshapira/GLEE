"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to Bob that takes into account our different inflation penalties.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

Since Bob faces a higher inflation penalty (20% per round) than I do (5% per round), it's in his interest to accept a reasonable offer sooner rather than later. My proposal gives him a substantial portion while acknowledging that I have a slightly stronger negotiating position due to the asymmetric inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since it's not advantageous to me compared to what I can propose next round. Even with the inflation penalty, I can still make a better counterproposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more balanced offer, considering that we're now on round 3 with increasing inflation costs.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This is reasonable because inflation is hurting Bob significantly more than me (20% vs 5% per round), so it's in his interest to reach an agreement soon. This even split respects both our positions while acknowledging the time pressure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. Even with the increasing inflation penalty, I can still make a better counterproposal in the next round. The inflation is impacting Bob much more significantly than me, which strengthens my negotiating position."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice that we're now in round 5, and the inflation penalties are becoming more significant, especially for Bob who loses 20% value per round versus my 5% per round.

{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52}

I'm slightly adjusting my offer to give Bob a bit more than half, recognizing that we need to reach an agreement soon. This is a fair compromise that accounts for our current situation - we've both lost some value already, but Bob is losing value four times faster than I am, so reaching an agreement is especially important for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 43 
# Bob gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer. At this point, with the compounding inflation penalties (my money is worth 22.62% less and Bob's is worth 67.23% less than in round 1), it makes sense to conclude the negotiation. The difference between Bob's offer of 43% for me and my last proposal of 48% has narrowed when accounting for inflation effects, making this a reasonable compromise."
