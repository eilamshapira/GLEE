Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor since I initiated the offer. Let's secure 40$ for you without worrying about inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it closer to even. I propose 51 for me, and 49 for you. We can both get a good amount and avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
