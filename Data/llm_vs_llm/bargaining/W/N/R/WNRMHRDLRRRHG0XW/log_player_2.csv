"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round. This split is too unfair, offering me only 10% of the total amount."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money. This way, we both benefit equally from the deal, and we can avoid further rounds where inflation will reduce the total value for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not a 50-50 split, getting $300,000 now is better than continuing further rounds where inflation will keep reducing the real value of the money. With 36% inflation, my $300,000 is worth about $192,000 in original value, and if we continue, it will be worth even less."
