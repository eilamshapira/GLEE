Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. This way we both get an equal share, and we can avoid losing more value to inflation. Let's agree on this balanced split and conclude the game quickly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
