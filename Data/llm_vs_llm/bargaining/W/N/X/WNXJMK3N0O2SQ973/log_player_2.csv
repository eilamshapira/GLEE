"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly to avoid losing value over rounds. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate Alice's offer. She is proposing:
- Bob (me): $40
- Alice: $60

This is not an equal split, which would be $50 each. The money loses 5% value each round, so there is pressure to reach an agreement quickly. However, if I reject this offer, I'll be able to make a counter-offer in the next round.

While her offer gives me less than half, I need to consider if I'm likely to get a better outcome by rejecting and making a counter-offer, taking into account the 5% depreciation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging the time pressure we're under.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. This way we both get an equal share, and we can avoid losing more value to inflation. Let's agree on this balanced split and conclude the game quickly.""}"
