600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I'm facing 20% inflation per round, it's important we reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a substantial $400000 while allowing me to offset some of my inflation risk.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, let's be fair. Inflation affects me too, but at a 10% rate. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a win-win.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to counter. Since my inflation rate is double yours (20% vs 10%), I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for our different inflation risks while still giving you a significant $450000. Let's reach an agreement now before both our shares diminish further.",Alice,3,
