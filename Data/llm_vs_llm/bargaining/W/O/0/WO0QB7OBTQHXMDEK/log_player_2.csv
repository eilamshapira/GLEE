Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I'm facing 20% inflation per round, it's important we reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a substantial $400000 while allowing me to offset some of my inflation risk.

# Alice gain: 600000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to counter. Since my inflation rate is double yours (20% vs 10%), I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This accounts for our different inflation risks while still giving you a significant $450000. Let's reach an agreement now before both our shares diminish further.

# Alice gain: 550000
