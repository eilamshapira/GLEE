"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start by dividing it fairly. I take 6000 and you take 4000. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10000
2. This is a 40-60 split, which isn't quite fair
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
4. However, inflation will reduce my money by 5% each round
5. If I reject, my next round's dollars will be worth 5% less
6. Multiple rejections could significantly reduce the final value

While the split isn't completely fair, getting $4000 now is better than risking further negotiations with inflation eating into the value. If I reject, even if I get a better nominal amount next round, it might be worth less due to inflation.
