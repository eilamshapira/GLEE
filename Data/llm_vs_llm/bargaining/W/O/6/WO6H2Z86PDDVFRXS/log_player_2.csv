Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger piece of the pie.  But this back and forth isn't helping anyone. Let's just split it down the middle and call it a day. 50/50. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
