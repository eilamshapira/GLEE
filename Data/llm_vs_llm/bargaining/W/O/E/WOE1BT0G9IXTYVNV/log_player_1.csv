"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

  ""alice_gain"": 5500,

I propose to take $5,500 for myself and give Bob $4,500. This offer acknowledges the asymmetry in inflation effects, giving me a bit more since my money loses value faster."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I propose an even split this time, with both of us receiving $5,000. This takes into account the increasing impact of inflation and aims to find a middle ground that Bob might accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}
```

Given the increasing impact of inflation, I propose taking $4,500 for myself and giving Bob $5,500. This offer aims to find a compromise that considers the decreasing value of the money for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Given the significant impact of inflation at this point, accepting Bob's offer of $2,500 for me and $7,500 for him is the better choice. The value of the money has decreased substantially, and continuing the game might lead to even lesser gains."
