"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I lose less value per round than you do. This way we both get a fair amount while maximizing our total value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 50-50 split. This way, we both get an equal share, and it's a fair compromise given the diminishing value. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. The offer is for $5000 each
2. Due to 10% inflation for me, my $5000 is now worth $4500
3. Due to 20% inflation for Bob, his $5000 is now worth $4000
4. This is still a reasonable amount, and waiting longer will only decrease the value further for both of us
5. The 50-50 split is fair, and accepting now is better than risking further rounds of negotiation
