"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a fair 50/50 split of the $10000. Since every round reduces the value for me, I believe it's best for both of us to agree now rather than risk future losses. Let's settle this quickly and equitably â€“ what do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing a 50/50 split where we each get $5000. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will decrease by 20% for me due to inflation, meaning the entire pot would only be worth $8000 to me.

If I were to get even 100% of that amount in the next round, I'd still only get $8000, which is less than the current $5000 plus potential future earnings. Additionally, Alice would likely reject an extremely unfair counter-offer.

A fair 50/50 split right now seems reasonable, especially considering the inflation penalty.
