"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$, which is 40% of the total amount. While this isn't an equal split, it's a substantial amount.

Given that:
1. I'll have the opportunity to make a counter-offer if I reject
2. There's no inflation affecting my value
3. We have 11 more rounds if needed
4. I don't know how inflation affects Alice

I think I can get a better deal. Since there's no inflation pressure on my side, I can afford to negotiate for a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's 40-60 split, I'll propose a more balanced split, but still giving Alice a slight advantage to increase the chances of acceptance. I'll propose a 45-55 split.

{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","This is an interesting development. Alice is now offering me $5,200 (52%) of the total, which is better than both previous offers. 

Key considerations:
1. I'm being offered more than half of the total amount
2. I'm not affected by inflation, so this $5,200 maintains its full value for me
3. Alice is experiencing significant inflation (36%), which explains why she's now willing to offer a better deal
4. The offer is quite reasonable

Given that I'm being offered more than half of the total amount and Alice's inflation penalty is increasing, this seems like a good deal to accept. There's a risk that if I reject, Alice might become more aggressive in future rounds due to her inflation pressure.
