"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's be practical. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  It's a strong offer, and considering the time pressure and inflation, we should aim for a quick resolution. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation impact is less severe for me in early rounds, and I still have a good position to negotiate. A 45-55 split in Bob's favor is too advantageous for him at this stage. I'll make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, 
""bob_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a fair split. I'm proposing a 52-48 division in my favor - this is more balanced and reasonable for both of us. With inflation affecting us both, we should reach an agreement soon.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair deal. 50/50.  Let's end this and avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The 50-50 split is fair, and with inflation continuing to affect both parties, it's wise to accept this balanced offer now rather than risk further devaluation of our potential gains in later rounds."
