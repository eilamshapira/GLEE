7000.0,3000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we settle now by dividing $10000 with me receiving $7000 and you $3000. I’m eager to conclude the negotiations quickly to avoid any delays (and potential inflation effects on my side). I believe this deal provides you a secure sum while keeping the process efficient. Looking forward to your thoughts.",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the impact of inflation, I propose we split the $10000 equally. This way, we both get a fair share and avoid further devaluation of the money. Let's conclude this quickly for our mutual benefit.",Bob,2,

3300.0,6700.0,"Hi Bob, in this round my money hasn’t depreciated while yours takes a further hit from inflation. To keep things mutually attractive, I’m offering you $6700 — which, at current values, gives you an effective benefit of about $4020 — while I keep $3300. This offer improves on the effective amount you’d likely get if we delay further, and I hope it convinces you to settle now before additional losses occur.",Alice,3,
