"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle now by dividing $10,000 with me receiving $7,000 and you $3,000. I’m eager to conclude the negotiations quickly to avoid any delays (and potential inflation effects on my side). I believe this deal provides you a secure sum while keeping the process efficient. Looking forward to your thoughts.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the impact of inflation, I propose we split the $10000 equally. This way, we both get a fair share and avoid further devaluation of the money. Let's conclude this quickly for our mutual benefit. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3300, ""bob_gain"": 6700, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in this round my money hasn’t depreciated while yours takes a further hit from inflation. To keep things mutually attractive, I’m offering you $6700 — which, at current values, gives you an effective benefit of about $4020 — while I keep $3300. This offer improves on the effective amount you’d likely get if we delay further, and I hope it convinces you to settle now before additional losses occur.""}"
