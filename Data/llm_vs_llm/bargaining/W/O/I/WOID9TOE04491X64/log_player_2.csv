"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle now by dividing $10000 with me receiving $7000 and you $3000. I’m eager to conclude the negotiations quickly to avoid any delays (and potential inflation effects on my side). I believe this deal provides you a secure sum while keeping the process efficient. Looking forward to your thoughts. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the impact of inflation, I propose we split the $10,000 equally. This way, we both get a fair share and avoid further devaluation of the money. Let's conclude this quickly for our mutual benefit.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in this round my money hasn’t depreciated while yours takes a further hit from inflation. To keep things mutually attractive, I’m offering you $6700 — which, at current values, gives you an effective benefit of about $4020 — while I keep $3300. This offer improves on the effective amount you’d likely get if we delay further, and I hope it convinces you to settle now before additional losses occur. 
# Bob gain: 6700 
# Alice gain: 3300
