Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, with the inflation in mind, I propose $55 for me and $45 for you. This split accounts for the devaluation we both face, ensuring we both get a fair share in terms of actual value. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
