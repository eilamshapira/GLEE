"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that accounts for the higher inflation rate that I (Alice) face.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I think this is a fair offer considering that my money loses value much faster than yours (20% vs 5% per round). If we delay, I'll be worse off more quickly, so I'm suggesting a slightly higher amount for myself to account for this disadvantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
