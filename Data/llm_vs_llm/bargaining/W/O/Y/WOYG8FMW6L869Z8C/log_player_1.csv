"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer. Since Bob faces a 5% depreciation per round while I don't, I can use this to my advantage. However, I don't want to be too aggressive in the first round.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. This is a reasonable opening offer that acknowledges both players need to reach an agreement while giving me a slight advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. For Bob, the $550,000 is now worth 5% less than in round 1, so it's effectively worth $522,500 to him
2. My $450,000 maintains its full value
3. If I reject, we move to round 3, where Bob's money will be worth another 5% less
4. We have 10 more rounds left, and Bob's position will continue to weaken
5. I can likely get a better deal by rejecting this offer

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's facing increasing depreciation (now 10% less value for him compared to round 1), I can push for a slightly better deal than my first offer. However, I need to be careful not to be too aggressive as we still need to reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

I'm offering a 65-35 split. For Bob, his $350,000 is now worth only $315,000 due to the 10% depreciation, so he should consider accepting this offer rather than letting the value decrease further in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. For Bob, the $500,000 is now worth about 14.26% less, so it's effectively worth around $428,700 to him
2. My $500,000 maintains its full value
3. If I reject, we move to round 5, where Bob's money will be worth even less (about 19% less than round 1)
4. We still have 8 more rounds possible, and Bob's position continues to weaken
5. With this depreciation rate, I can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Bob's money is now worth about 19% less than in round 1, and his position is weakening with each round, I can push for an even better split while still keeping it reasonable enough that he might accept.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm offering a 70-30 split. For Bob, his $300,000 is worth even less due to the ~19% depreciation (around $243,000 in round 1 value), so he should seriously consider accepting this offer rather than risking further depreciation. If he rejects, his negotiating position will continue to weaken in subsequent rounds."
