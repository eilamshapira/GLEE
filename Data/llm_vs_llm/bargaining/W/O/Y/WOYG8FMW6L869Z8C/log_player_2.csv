"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me 400,000$ while taking 600,000$ for herself. If I reject, in the next round I can make a counter-offer, but my potential gains will be worth 5% less due to inflation (while Alice's value remains the same).

400,000$ now is better than 400,000$ × 0.95 = 380,000$ in the next round. However, I believe I can negotiate a better deal since we're splitting a million dollars and this first offer is notably in Alice's favor.

Given that:
1. I have plenty of rounds left (11 more)
2. The inflation penalty isn't too severe for just one round
3. I can make the next offer
4. A 60-40 split in Alice's favor seems unfair for an opening offer

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer. Since I want to be reasonable but also account for my inflation disadvantage, I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This offer is fairer than Alice's initial 60-40 split, and by giving Alice a substantial 450,000$, I show willingness to reach a reasonable compromise. The slightly higher amount for me (550,000$) helps offset my inflation disadvantage in future rounds if negotiations continue."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has actually made a WORSE offer than her first one (400k vs 350k for me)
2. Due to inflation, my gains are already worth 9.75% less
3. If I reject, the next round will have a 14.26% inflation penalty for me

Current offer value to me: 350,000$ × 0.9025 = 315,875$

This is a concerning development because:
- Alice's second offer is more aggressive than her first
- She seems willing to let inflation erode my position
- We still have 9 rounds left, but each round makes my position worse

However, Alice's more aggressive second offer suggests she might be willing to play hardball and let inflation weaken my position further. If this continues, I might end up having to accept an even worse deal later.

Still, with 9 rounds left and this offer being worse than the first one, I think I should try one more negotiation round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given Alice's increasingly aggressive strategy and my worsening position due to inflation, I need to make a more appealing offer while still protecting my interests.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a perfectly equal 50-50 split. This is:
1. Completely fair on the surface
2. More generous than my previous offer
3. Hard to argue against from a fairness perspective
4. Takes into account that I'm at a disadvantage due to inflation

By moving from my previous 55-45 split to a 50-50 split, I'm showing significant willingness to compromise. If Alice rejects this perfectly equal division, it would demonstrate that she's intentionally trying to exploit the inflation penalty to force an unfair outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","This situation is getting worse:

1. Alice's offers are getting progressively worse (400k -> 350k -> 300k)
2. Current offer's real value to me: 300,000$ × 0.8145 = 244,350$
3. Alice seems to be deliberately exploiting the inflation penalty
4. She rejected even a perfectly fair 50-50 split
5. We still have 7 rounds left, but my position weakens by 5% each round

If I reject:
- Next round inflation will be at 22.62%
- Alice's behavior suggests she'll likely continue this strategy
- My negotiating position is getting weaker with each round

Even though this is an unfair offer, the trend suggests that:
1. Alice will continue to make worse offers
2. Inflation will continue to erode my position
3. I might end up with even less if I wait

Given this analysis, I should accept this unfavorable offer now rather than risk an even worse outcome later.
