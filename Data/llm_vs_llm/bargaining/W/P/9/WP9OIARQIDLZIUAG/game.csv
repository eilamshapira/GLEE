8000.0,2000.0,"Hi Bob, let's split this fairly. I'm taking 8000 and you get 2000. What do you say?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
2252.69,7747.31,"Alice, in view of our future rounds—and the fact that my money loses 5% value each round—I’m proposing a split that reflects our respective positions. I offer you $2252.69 and I’d receive $7747.31. I believe this is fair given that if you reject, you can propose next round and secure about $2252.69 for yourself anyway, while further delay only diminishes my effective return. Let’s conclude the game now to avoid unnecessary discounting on my side.",Bob,2,

3000.0,7000.0,"Bob, since you rejected my fair offer, and now it's my turn again, I'm adjusting to this more realistic split. I'll take 3000 and you can have 7000. We're running out of time. Let's get this done.",Alice,3,
,,"Alice, I appreciate the offer. Even though 7000 sounds good in nominal terms, when I factor in the 9.75% discount that applies in round 3, it comes out to an effective value of about $6317.50 for me. If we continue, further rounds mean even deeper discounts for me, along with the risk of running out of rounds altogether. For that reason, I’m accepting your proposal.",Bob,3,accept
