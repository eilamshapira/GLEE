"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, in view of our future rounds—and the fact that my money loses 5% value each round—I’m proposing a split that reflects our respective positions. I offer you $2252.69 and I’d receive $7747.31. I believe this is fair given that if you reject, you can propose next round and secure about $2252.69 for yourself anyway, while further delay only diminishes my effective return. Let’s conclude the game now to avoid unnecessary discounting on my side. 
# Alice gain: 2252.69 
# Bob gain: 7747.31 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
