"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10,000$, which is 40% of the total amount. That's less than half, but I need to consider:

1. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less next round when I make my offer
2. Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further inflation
3. 4000$ now is better than risking getting nothing if we can't agree in 12 rounds
4. However, I could potentially get a better deal by making a counter-offer

Given that 4000$ is a significant amount and the risk of inflation, I'll reject this time to try for a better split, but I need to be careful not to be too greedy.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but considering that the money is now worth 10% less to me.

To get Alice's cooperation, I'll propose a fair split that's slightly in her favor, as this might increase the chances of acceptance and avoid further inflation losses.

{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200}

I'm offering a 48%-52% split, which is more balanced than Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm willing to be fair while still protecting my interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has improved her offer from 4000$ to 4500$
2. Due to 19% inflation, 4500$ now is worth about 3645$ in round 1 value for me
3. If I reject, the next round will have 27% inflation, making any amount worth even less
4. We've already used 3 rounds out of 12, and prolonged negotiation is risky
5. Alice has shown willingness to compromise by increasing my share

While I might be tempted to negotiate for more, the inflation is significantly eating into my gains. The offer is more balanced than before (45-55 split), and waiting longer will only decrease the real value of my share.
