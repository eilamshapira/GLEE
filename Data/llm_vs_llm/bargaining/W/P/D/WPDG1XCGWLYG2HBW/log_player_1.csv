Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""Let's go with an 80-20 split. Considering inflation, it's fair for me.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since there's 20% inflation for you each round, your $40 now is worth more than waiting another round where you'd need more dollars to get the same value. This is a fair deal considering the inflation penalty you face. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
