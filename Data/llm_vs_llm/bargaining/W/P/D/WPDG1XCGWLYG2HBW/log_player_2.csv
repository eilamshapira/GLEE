"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's go with an 80-20 split. Considering inflation, it's fair for me. 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is suggesting I take $20 and she takes $80. While there is inflation of 20% per round for Alice (but 0% for me), this division heavily favors her. If I reject and make a counter-offer, she may be incentivized to accept a more balanced split since her money will be worth less in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since there's 20% inflation for you each round, your $40 now is worth more than waiting another round where you'd need more dollars to get the same value. This is a fair deal considering the inflation penalty you face.""}"
