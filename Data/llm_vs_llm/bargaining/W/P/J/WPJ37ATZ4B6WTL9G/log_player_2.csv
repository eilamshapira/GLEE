"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing an even split of the money, $5000 for each of us. This is a fair offer, but I need to consider the inflation penalty. If I reject and we go to another round, the $10,000 will be worth 20% less to me, so my maximum possible gain would be $8,000 in the next round. Given that I'm being offered half the total amount now, accepting is my best move.
