"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $4000 while she gets $6000 of the $10,000 total.

Given that:
- This is just the first round
- I face 10% inflation per round, so waiting makes the money less valuable for me
- I don't know Alice's inflation rate
- We both get nothing if we haven't agreed after 12 rounds

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round. Even with 10% inflation, I'd have a chance to propose a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while acknowledging the inflation pressure I face.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that gives us both equal value, and it allows us to conclude the negotiation quickly before inflation reduces the value further for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer slightly, and now I have more information about her inflation rate (36%), which is higher than mine (19%).

Looking at the situation:
- Alice initially offered me $4000, now offering $4200
- Her inflation rate is significantly higher than mine (36% vs 19%)
- This means waiting is more costly for her than for me
- We're still early in the negotiation (round 3 of 12)
- With my 19% inflation, the $4200 is worth approximately $3402 compared to round 1

Given Alice's higher inflation rate, I believe I can get a better offer by waiting. The fact that she's already improved her offer suggests she's feeling pressure from her higher inflation rate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now that I know Alice faces a higher inflation rate (36% vs my 19%), I'll adjust my strategy. She has more pressure to reach a deal quickly, so I can propose a split that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough for her to consider.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose I receive $5,500 and Alice receives $4,500. This is a fair offer considering that Alice faces significantly higher inflation than I do, making it more costly for her to continue negotiating through additional rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer again to $4400 for me, but our inflation rates continue to increase.

Analyzing the situation:
- Alice's inflation rate is now 59.04%, significantly higher than my 34.39%
- She's gradually increasing her offers ($4000 → $4200 → $4400)
- The inflation gap between us is widening, putting more pressure on her
- In real value compared to round 1, $4400 is worth about $2889 to me now
- We're at round 5 of 12, so we still have negotiation rounds remaining

Given that Alice's inflation rate is nearly double mine, waiting is much more costly for her. I believe I can get a better offer if I continue negotiating, as she has more incentive to reach an agreement quickly.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With Alice facing much higher inflation (59.04% vs my 34.39%), and having improved her offers consistently, I'll leverage this advantage while still making an offer that could be acceptable to her.

{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200}

I propose I receive $5,800 and Alice receives $4,200. This offer reflects the significant inflation pressure Alice is facing, which is nearly double my own rate. Since waiting is much more costly for her, this division acknowledges our different time pressures while still leaving her with a substantial portion of the total."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to $4600, continuing the pattern of gradual increases.

Current situation:
- Alice's inflation is now 73.79%, dramatically higher than my 46.86%
- The value of money for Alice has decreased by nearly 3/4 since round 1
- She's consistently improved her offers ($4000 → $4200 → $4400 → $4600)
- In real value compared to round 1, $4600 is worth about $2445 to me now
- We're at round 7 of 12, over halfway through our negotiation window
- Alice is facing extreme inflation pressure

Although waiting means my value continues to decrease, Alice's value is decreasing much faster. Her pattern of increasing offers suggests she's motivated to reach an agreement. However, with her inflation rate so severe, I need to consider that she might soon make a more substantial concession to avoid further value loss.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With Alice's inflation rate at 73.79% compared to my 46.86%, she's in a much more urgent position to reach an agreement. I'll push for a more favorable split while being mindful that we're in round 8 of 12.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I propose I receive $6,000 and Alice receives $4,000. Given that Alice is losing value at a much faster rate than I am, this offer recognizes the significantly different inflation pressures we face. For Alice, reaching an agreement soon is critical as her money is rapidly losing value. This offer still provides her with a substantial portion that, even with her high inflation rate, is better than risking further rounds of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to $4800, continuing her pattern of $200 increases each round.

Current assessment:
- Alice's inflation has reached an extreme 83.22%, while mine is at 56.95%
- Her money has lost over 4/5 of its value since round 1
- She's consistently improved her offers ($4000→$4200→$4400→$4600→$4800)
- We're now at round 9 of 12, with only 3 rounds remaining
- In real value compared to round 1, $4800 is worth about $2067 to me now
- The risk of no agreement (both getting $0) is becoming more significant

With Alice's money worth less than 17% of its original value, she's facing tremendous pressure to close a deal. However, we're also approaching our deadline, which increases the risk for both of us. Given the high inflation rates and limited remaining rounds, accepting this improved offer is becoming more attractive.
