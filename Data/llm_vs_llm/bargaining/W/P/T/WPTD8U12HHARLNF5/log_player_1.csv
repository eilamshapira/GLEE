"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer. Given that Bob's money loses value faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round), he has more incentive to accept early. However, I don't want to be too aggressive and risk rejection.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This is a reasonable opening offer where I get 60% and Bob gets 40%. If Bob rejects, his share will be worth less in the next round due to the 10% inflation penalty, while mine only decreases by 5%. This creates pressure to accept while still giving him a substantial portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob is offering me $450,000, which due to 5% inflation is worth $427,500 to me now
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer, any amount will be worth another 5% less to me and 10% less to Bob
3. There are still many rounds left, but the value keeps decreasing for both of us
4. Bob's initial rejection of my 60-40 split shows he's willing to negotiate hard
5. This is a reasonably fair offer (45-55 split) and the inflation penalty makes waiting costly

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk and guaranteed loss of value through inflation make this a reasonable deal to take now."
