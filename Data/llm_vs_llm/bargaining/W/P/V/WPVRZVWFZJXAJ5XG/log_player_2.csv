"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether Alice's offer is fair given my circumstances. She's offering me $400,000 while keeping $600,000 for herself. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but inflation will reduce the value of money by 5% next round.

If I reject, the total value to me next round would be $950,000 (5% less). I could propose a more favorable split then, but Alice might reject as well, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

Given the substantial amount offered ($400,000) and the guaranteed loss from inflation if negotiations continue, I'll respond:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
