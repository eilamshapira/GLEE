"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 791667 
# Alice gain: 208333 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the rules. I'm Bob, and I need to consider the decaying value of the money with each rejected offer.

Let's analyze the situation. Alice is offering me $791,667 in the first round. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less to me in the next round. Therefore, the value of the money for me would be 0.95 * $1,000,000 = $950,000. Then, I get to make the proposal, and Alice decides.

If I accept, I get $791,667 now.

Since I get a relatively large sum of money in the first round and I am uncertain what the alternative of making the offer would be, I will take the money.
