"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by offering a reasonable division that accounts for the potential inflation effect on my value.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that I face 5% inflation per round if we delay, which reduces the value of my share over time."
