"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that gives both of us a good amount, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first move.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount while acknowledging my position as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's worth 20% less due to inflation, it's still a fair 50-50 split, and rejecting it would lead to further value loss through inflation. This way we both get $5,000 (though at 80% of the original value), which is better than risking further depreciation through more rounds of negotiation."
