"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. The offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less to me in the next round
3. Even if I make a more favorable proposal next round, Alice might reject it
4. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush - securing $5000 now is better than risking getting less due to inflation
5. The equal split promotes goodwill and quick resolution
