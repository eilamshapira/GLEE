"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the actual value I'll get. 
20% of 450000 is 90000, so the value I'll get is 450000 - 90000 = 360000.
Considering this, I don't think it's a good deal for me.
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less in the first round and another 20% less in the second round, which is a total of 36% less (1 - 0.8 * 0.8). The money Bob gains is worth 5% less in the first round and another 5% less in the second round, which is a total of 9.75% less (1 - 0.95 * 0.95).

To make a fair offer, I'll consider these values.
My offer:
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}"
