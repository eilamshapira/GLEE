"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

For me (Bob), the money is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000.
For Alice, the money is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.80 = $800,000.

Considering this, my offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is:
$1,000,000 * (1 - 0.0975) = $902,500 (for me, the total amount is worth this, but I would get half of the total, so $500,000 is worth $500,000 * (1 - 0.0975) = $452,500 to me, but since the offer is $500,000, the actual value is $500,000 * 0.9025 = $451,250)

And for Alice, the actual value of the money she would gain is:
$1,000,000 * (1 - 0.36) = $640,000 (for Alice, the total amount is worth this, but she would get half of the total, so $500,000 is worth $500,000 * (1 - 0.36) = $320,000 to her)

Given that the offer gives me a relatively fair share considering the inflation, I accept.
