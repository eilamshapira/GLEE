,,,Bob,1,reject
140000.0,860000.0,"Alice, the longer we delay the outcome the more we both lose—especially you, given the steeper 20% devaluation per round. Accept this offer now: I get $860000 and you get $140000 (which, after the 20% discount, is worth $112000 effective today). Waiting leads to even lower effective values for you.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
320000.0,680000.0,"Bob, I understand your point about inflation hitting me harder, but your last offer was too one-sided. Let's try to find a middle ground. I propose $320000 for me and $680000 for you. This way, you still get the majority, but I get a fair share considering the rapid devaluation on my side. What do you think?",Alice,3,

166667.0,833333.0,"Alice, consider how much value we lose with each additional round. Right now, my money is worth about 85.74% of its round‐1 value and yours just 51.2%—so delaying hurts you more. In an equilibrium of our alternating‐offer game, if you were to reject and propose in round 5, you’d only secure a nominal share worth about $208333, which becomes roughly $85333 effective. To avoid further losses, I’m offering you a nominal $166667 now (which is worth $85333 effective), while I take $833333 (worth approximately $714483 effective). This division is the fair equilibrium split given our discount factors. I urge you to accept this offer now so we both minimize our losses.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
208333.0,791667.0,"Bob, I see your point about the equilibrium, but I believe we can still find a better balance. Given the current inflation rates, I'm proposing $208333 for me, which aligns with your calculation for my share in the next round, and $791667 for you. This way, you still receive a significant majority while I get a fair amount considering the devaluation. Let's end this game on a reasonable note.",Alice,5,
