Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the longer we delay the outcome the more we both lose—especially you, given the steeper 20% devaluation per round. Accept this offer now: I get $860000 and you get $140000 (which, after the 20% discount, is worth $112000 effective today). Waiting leads to even lower effective values for you. 
# Alice gain: 140000 
# Bob gain: 860000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider how much value we lose with each additional round. Right now, my money is worth about 85.74% of its round‐1 value and yours just 51.2%—so delaying hurts you more. In an equilibrium of our alternating‐offer game, if you were to reject and propose in round 5, you’d only secure a nominal share worth about $208333, which becomes roughly $85333 effective. To avoid further losses, I’m offering you a nominal $166667 now (which is worth $85333 effective), while I take $833333 (worth approximately $714483 effective). This division is the fair equilibrium split given our discount factors. I urge you to accept this offer now so we both minimize our losses. 
# Alice gain: 166667 
# Bob gain: 833333

  ""message"": ""Bob, I see your point about the equilibrium, but I believe we can still find a better balance. Given the current inflation rates, I'm proposing $208,333 for me, which aligns with your calculation for my share in the next round, and $791,667 for you. This way, you still receive a significant majority while I get a fair amount considering the devaluation. Let's end this game on a reasonable note.""
