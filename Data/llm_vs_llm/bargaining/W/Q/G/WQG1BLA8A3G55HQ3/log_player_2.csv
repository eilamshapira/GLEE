Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 860000, ""alice_gain"": 140000, ""message"": ""Alice, the longer we delay the outcome the more we both lose—especially you, given the steeper 20% devaluation per round. Accept this offer now: I get $860,000 and you get $140,000 (which, after the 20% discount, is worth $112,000 effective today). Waiting leads to even lower effective values for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about inflation hitting me harder, but your last offer was too one-sided. Let's try to find a middle ground. I propose $320000 for me and $680000 for you. This way, you still get the majority, but I get a fair share considering the rapid devaluation on my side. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 680000 
# Alice gain: 320000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 833333, ""alice_gain"": 166667, ""message"": ""Alice, consider how much value we lose with each additional round. Right now, my money is worth about 85.74% of its round‐1 value and yours just 51.2%—so delaying hurts you more. In an equilibrium of our alternating‐offer game, if you were to reject and propose in round 5, you’d only secure a nominal share worth about $208,333, which becomes roughly $85,333 effective. To avoid further losses, I’m offering you a nominal $166,667 now (which is worth $85,333 effective), while I take $833,333 (worth approximately $714,483 effective). This division is the fair equilibrium split given our discount factors. I urge you to accept this offer now so we both minimize our losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point about the equilibrium, but I believe we can still find a better balance. Given the current inflation rates, I'm proposing $208333 for me, which aligns with your calculation for my share in the next round, and $791667 for you. This way, you still receive a significant majority while I get a fair amount considering the devaluation. Let's end this game on a reasonable note. 
# Bob gain: 791667 
# Alice gain: 208333
