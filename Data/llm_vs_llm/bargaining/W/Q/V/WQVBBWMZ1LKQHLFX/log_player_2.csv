"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with an equal split to ensure fairness for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which gives us both $50. This seems fair at first glance, but I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject and we move to the next round, my share would be worth 20% less. However, I could potentially negotiate for more.

Given that inflation will reduce my purchasing power each round and we only have 12 rounds total to reach an agreement, accepting a fair offer early is strategic.
