"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with an offer that takes into account the 10% inflation penalty I face with each passing round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering you a slightly larger portion since I face a 10% inflation penalty if we move to another round, which would reduce the value of my share. This is a fair division that gives both of us a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
