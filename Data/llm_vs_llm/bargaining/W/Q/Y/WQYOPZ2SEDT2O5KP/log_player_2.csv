"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice offers me $4,000 (40%) while taking $6,000 (60%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 10% less to me
3. My $4,000 now is better than $4,444 ($4,000/0.9) in the next round
4. There's no guarantee Alice will accept a better offer from me
5. A 60-40 split isn't terribly unfair, though not in my favor

Given the inflation penalty and the risk of further negotiation, I'll accept this offer.
