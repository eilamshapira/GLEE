4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, considering that the money loses 5% value for you each round but not for me, I think this is a fair split. You'll get $4500 now, which is better than a larger amount several rounds later after inflation. Let's make a deal now and both walk away happy.",Bob,2,

5300.0,4700.0,"Bob, I understand your point about the inflation affecting me. However, my previous offer was only slightly more beneficial to me, and you rejected it. This time, I'm only asking for 5300, which I believe is a fair compromise. Please consider accepting this offer; the longer we wait, the less the money will be worth to both of us!",Alice,3,
