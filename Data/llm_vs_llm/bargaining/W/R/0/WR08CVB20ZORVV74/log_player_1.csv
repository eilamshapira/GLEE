"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering that the money loses 5% value for you each round but not for me, I think this is a fair split. You'll get $4500 now, which is better than a larger amount several rounds later after inflation. Let's make a deal now and both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
