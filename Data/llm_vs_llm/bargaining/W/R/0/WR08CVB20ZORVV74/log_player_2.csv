"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money reasonably. I propose 5500 for me and 4500 for you. This is a good starting point, and hopefully, we can agree quickly! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's offering me $4500, keeping $5500 for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. The money doesn't lose value for me, but loses 5% value for Alice each round
4. We have 11 more rounds if I reject

Since Alice will lose value each round and I won't, I have some negotiating leverage. I can likely get a better deal by making a counter-offer. Even though her offer isn't terrible, I believe I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for Alice's time pressure due to inflation:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering that the money loses 5% value for you each round but not for me, I think this is a fair split. You'll get $4500 now, which is better than a larger amount several rounds later after inflation. Let's make a deal now and both walk away happy.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about the inflation affecting me. However, my previous offer was only slightly more beneficial to me, and you rejected it. This time, I'm only asking for 5300, which I believe is a fair compromise. Please consider accepting this offer; the longer we wait, the less the money will be worth to both of us! 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:
1. She's now offering me $4700 (up from $4500 in round 1)
2. She's asking for $5300 (down from $5500)
3. The money is already worth 9.75% less to her
4. If we continue, we have 9 more rounds, and her value will keep decreasing
5. She's showing willingness to negotiate and has moved in my favor

While I could potentially get an even better deal by waiting longer, there's also a risk of deadlock if we both get too aggressive. This is a reasonable improvement from her first offer, and she's made a good faith move toward my position.
