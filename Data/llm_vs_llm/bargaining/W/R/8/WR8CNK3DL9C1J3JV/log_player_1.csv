"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me propose a fair split while considering that any delay will cost me 10% in value.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose to take $550,000 and give Bob $450,000. This is a reasonable split that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting it. If he refuses, my next potential gain would be reduced by 10% due to inflation, so this is a strong initial offer."
