"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split. This gives you a solid portion while acknowledging my first-mover role.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think 55-45 is a more reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
* If I accept this offer now, I get $45, but with 10% inflation, it's actually worth $40.50 to me
* If I reject and make a new offer next round, I'll face 20% inflation on whatever amount I end up getting
* My next offer would need to be significantly higher to overcome the inflation penalty
* Bob knows he doesn't face inflation pressure, so he has a stronger negotiating position
* $40.50 is less than I wanted but still a significant amount

Given these factors, I'll accept. Getting $40.50 in real value now is better than risking further inflation.
