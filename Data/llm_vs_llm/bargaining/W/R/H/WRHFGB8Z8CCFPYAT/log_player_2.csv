"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split of the $1,000,000. While this seems fair on the surface, I need to account for the inflation factor that affects me.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value to me will be worth 10% less (so the $1,000,000 would effectively be worth $900,000 to me). If we keep going back and forth, each round reduces the value by another 10% for me.

Given this inflation penalty and the risk of getting nothing if we reach 12 rounds without agreement, accepting the even split now is reasonable.
