"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, 50-50 split. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

At 50-50, I would get $50. If I reject and we go to the next round, any amount I get will be worth 10% less due to inflation. So even if I proposed a more favorable split in round 2, I need to factor in that $50 in round 2 would only be worth $45 to me.

Given that:
1. This is a fair opening offer
2. Inflation will reduce my purchasing power in future rounds
3. Alice has no inflation penalty, so she can afford to be patient
4. There's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

The 50-50 split in round 1 is actually a good deal for me.
