"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob that gives me a good portion while being fair to incentivize his acceptance, especially considering the 5% inflation penalty I'll face if we go to another round.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This gives me a majority share while offering Bob a substantial portion that reflects fairness in our negotiation. Given that I face a 5% inflation penalty if we move to another round, this offer balances my desire for a good outcome with the risk of delay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer. While this gives me 450,000 instead of the 550,000 I initially proposed, rejecting would mean facing another 5% inflation penalty in the next round. If I were to reject and propose a better split in round 3, my gains would be worth even less due to compounding inflation. 450,000 now is better than potentially losing more value through continued negotiation."
