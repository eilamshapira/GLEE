"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so there's no inflation impact yet
2. Alice is offering me 40% of the total amount
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 5% less to me
   - Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation
4. 40$ is a reasonable offer, though slightly below the equal split
5. Getting something good now might be better than risking a worse outcome later
