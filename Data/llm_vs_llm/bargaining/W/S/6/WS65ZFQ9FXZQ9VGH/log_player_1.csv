Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's aim for a more balanced split. I'm offering 60 for me and 40 for you. This is still fair, and we avoid further inflation losses for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
