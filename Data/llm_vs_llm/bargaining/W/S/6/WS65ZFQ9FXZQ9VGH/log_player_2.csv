"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a fair split favoring me slightly, considering I'm making the first offer. We can negotiate if needed. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Alice, let's aim for a more balanced split. I'm offering 60 for me and 40 for you. This is still fair, and we avoid further inflation losses for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point. How about we meet in the middle a bit? I'll take 52 and you take 48. That should compensate you for the small inflation loss. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
