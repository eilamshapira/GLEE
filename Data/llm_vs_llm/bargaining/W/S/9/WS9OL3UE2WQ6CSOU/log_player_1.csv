"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $1,000,000 with Bob.

Given that I'm facing 20% inflation per round, I should aim for a fair but advantageous first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60/40 split in our favor. This gives you a substantial portion while still offering Bob a significant amount. Since inflation will reduce the value of money in future rounds, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll now make a counter-offer, taking into account that I've already lost 20% of the value and another round would mean further depreciation.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50/50 split which is fair for both of us. This is a significant concession from my initial offer and gives Bob an equal share. Given the inflation penalty I'm facing, this balanced division allows us both to walk away with substantial value. Let's finalize this deal now and avoid further depreciation of the money's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice that we're getting closer in our offers, but time is quickly reducing the value of my potential gains. I need to be more strategic now.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I propose a 45/55 split in Bob's favor. This is a significant concession from my previous offers and acknowledges that Bob may have a stronger negotiating position. At this point, I've already lost almost 50% of the money's value due to inflation, and each additional round costs me more. This offer represents a reasonable compromise that gives Bob the majority share while still allowing me to salvage meaningful value."
