"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a proposal for dividing the $1,000,000 between Bob and me.

Considering the 20% inflation per round for me, I should aim for a fair but advantageous first offer, recognizing that if Bob rejects it, my money will be worth less in subsequent rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split of $500,000 each. This is a perfectly fair division that respects both of our interests equally."
