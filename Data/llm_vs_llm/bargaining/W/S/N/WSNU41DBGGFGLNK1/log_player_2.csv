"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Given that we're dividing $100 and Alice is offering an even 50-50 split, it seems fair on the surface. However, I need to account for the inflation effect - with each round, the money is worth 20% less to me. If I reject this and make a counter-offer, there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and my potential gains will decrease due to inflation.

A 50-50 split in the first round means I get $50 at full value. If I try for more in the next round but face rejection, the value would already be reduced.
