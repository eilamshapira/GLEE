"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer to avoid prolonging the game due to the inflation factor affecting my share. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

This offer splits the money evenly between us, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of losing value due to inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual value I perceive from Bob's offer is:

400000 * 0.9 = 360000

Considering this, Bob's offer seems somewhat unfair, as it gives him a significantly larger share. However, I must weigh this against the risk of further inflation reducing the value of my potential gain in subsequent rounds.

For now, I'll reject this offer, hoping to negotiate a better split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, and considering Bob's previous offer, I'll aim for a more balanced distribution while keeping in mind the decreasing value for me.

In Round 3, the value for me is further reduced by 10% from Round 2's already decreased value, so:

1,000,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 810,000

is the effective value for me if I were to receive the entire amount. To make a fair offer, I'll split this effective value close to evenly but slightly in my favor to account for the risk Bob is taking by potentially going into further rounds.

Let's propose a split where I get 55% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob gets 45%. This way, I'm accounting for the inflation hit while trying to be reasonable.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 72.9% of its original value (since 100% - 27.1% = 72.9%). So, if I accept Bob's offer, the actual value I perceive is:

420000 * 0.729 = 306180

This offer is still somewhat in Bob's favor, but considering the significant reduction in value due to inflation, I need to weigh the potential benefits of accepting this offer against the risks of further negotiation.

Given that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, and we are only in Round 4 with 8 rounds left, I should consider accepting an offer that, while not ideal, still provides a substantial amount, especially since the inflation's impact on Bob's perception of value is unknown.
