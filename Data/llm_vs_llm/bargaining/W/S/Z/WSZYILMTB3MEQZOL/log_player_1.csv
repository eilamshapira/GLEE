"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 1000000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that you receive the entire $1,000,000 right away. As you know, every extra round reduces my money by 10%, but your money remains unaffected. I believe itâ€™s in both our best interests to settle immediately rather than delay and risk further loss on my side. I look forward to your acceptance.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. Since you lose 10% each round, accepting this offer ensures you get the most value out of your share. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
