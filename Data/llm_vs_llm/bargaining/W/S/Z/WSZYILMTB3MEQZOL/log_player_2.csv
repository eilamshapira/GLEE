"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that you receive the entire $1000000 right away. As you know, every extra round reduces my money by 10%, but your money remains unaffected. I believe itâ€™s in both our best interests to settle immediately rather than delay and risk further loss on my side. I look forward to your acceptance. 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

It's suspicious that Alice is willing to give up all the money immediately. Let's see what she proposes in the next round. Also, by rejecting, we might get more information about Alice's strategy in future rounds. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I can afford to wait. However, since Alice loses 10% of the value each round, she might be inclined to give me a better deal if she wants to maximize her gain."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. Since you lose 10% each round, accepting this offer ensures you get the most value out of your share.""}"
