"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The current offer is a 50-50 split ($50 each)
2. If I reject, I can make an offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 10% less to me (I'd need $55.56 to equal current $50)
   - The money will be worth 20% less to Alice (she'd need $62.50 to equal current $50)
3. This means we're both losing value by continuing

Given that:
- The offer is fair (equal split)
- Waiting would reduce the value for both of us
- There's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable offer next round
