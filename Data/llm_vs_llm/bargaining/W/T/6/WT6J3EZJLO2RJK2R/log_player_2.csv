"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject, in the next round I can make an offer, but:
1. My share will be worth 20% less due to inflation
2. Alice's share will only depreciate by 5%
3. Alice could reject my counter-offer, leading to further depreciation

With the current 50-50 split offer:
- I get $5000 now
- Alice gets $5000 now

If I reject and we go another round:
- My $5000 would only be worth $4000 (20% less)
- Alice's share would still be worth $4750 (5% less)

Given this asymmetric inflation and the risk of further rounds, the current fair split is actually quite reasonable.
