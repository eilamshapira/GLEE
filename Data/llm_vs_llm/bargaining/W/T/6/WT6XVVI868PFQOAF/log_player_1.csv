"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I'm Alice, I need to propose a split of $100 to Bob. With inflation hitting me at 20% per round, I need to secure a good amount early on.

Here's my first offer, designed to be fair enough to entice Bob to accept:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   I'm asking for $60, leaving $40 for Bob.
*   This is a slight advantage for me, recognizing the inflation hitting my earnings with each round. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid further negotiations and potential loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob rejected my initial offer. Now, let's analyze Bob's offer and the current situation:

*   **Bob's Offer:** 50/50 split
*   **Inflation Impact on Me:** My money is worth 20% less than in round 1.
*   **Inflation Impact on Bob:** Bob's money is worth 10% less than in round 1.
*   **Remaining Rounds:** 11

If I accept Bob's offer, I get $50, but it's only worth $50 * 0.8 = $40 from round 1.

If I reject, I become the proposer in the next round, but my money will be worth $100 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $64 from the beginning. I also have to guess what Bob will accept.

Given the inflation and the fact that we have 11 rounds left, a 50/50 split (giving me the equivalent of $40 from round 1) is not very appealing, but still, better than nothing at the end.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
