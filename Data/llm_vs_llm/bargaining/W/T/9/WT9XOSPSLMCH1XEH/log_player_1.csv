Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is more equitable than your initial offer, and since I know I'm not affected by inflation, I can continue negotiating if needed. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
