"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start considering the potential for negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000, which is a substantial amount
2. However, it's less than half of the total
3. There's no inflation penalty for me in future rounds
4. I can make a counter-offer in the next round
5. Since I don't lose value over time, I can afford to negotiate for a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split in my favor, but not too aggressive to avoid prolonged negotiations:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is more equitable than your initial offer, and since I know I'm not affected by inflation, I can continue negotiating if needed.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation affecting my share and to reach a quicker agreement, I propose we split it 50-50. This is fair and equitable for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is now offering a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. I know that Alice's share is affected by 36% inflation, so her $500,000 is actually worth less to her
3. My share maintains its full value since I'm not affected by inflation
4. If I reject, I could potentially negotiate for more in the next round, as Alice's inflation penalty increases
5. However, $500,000 is a significant improvement from her first offer
6. There's also a risk that prolonged negotiation could lead to a worse outcome

Even though I could potentially get more by continuing to negotiate, a 50-50 split is traditionally considered fair, and I've already achieved a significant improvement from the initial 60-40 offer.
