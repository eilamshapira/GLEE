Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 2000, ""bob_gain"": 8000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that you receive $8,000 and I take $2,000. Accepting now guarantees you $8,000 without any depreciation, while delaying to the next round means your share would be worth only 20% less. Let's settle this round and avoid any unnecessary loss.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, in this round, I propose we split the money 60/40. You still get a good chunk. Accepting now guarantees you more than what you'd get if you reject and the game continues. Consider this my best offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3

If you reject and wait for round 4, you'll have the proposer's chance but—with the inflation crushing your share even more—you won't gain anything meaningful. In round 5, when I'm back in control, you'll end up with almost nothing. So I'm offering you $1 now, which is better than the zero you'd ultimately receive. Please accept this offer to secure a positive outcome for you.""}"

Round 4

Bob's offer:
