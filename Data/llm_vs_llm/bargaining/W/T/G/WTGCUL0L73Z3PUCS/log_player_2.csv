"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that you receive $8000 and I take $2000. Accepting now guarantees you $8000 without any depreciation, while delaying to the next round means your share would be worth only 20% less. Let's settle this round and avoid any unnecessary loss. 
# Bob gain: 8000 
# Alice gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, in this round, I propose we split the money 60/40. You still get a good chunk. Accepting now guarantees you more than what you'd get if you reject and the game continues. Consider this my best offer.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in this round the stakes are clear. If you reject and wait for round 4, you'll have the proposer's chance but—with the inflation crushing your share even more—you won't gain anything meaningful. In round 5, when I'm back in control, you'll end up with almost nothing. So I'm offering you $1 now, which is better than the zero you'd ultimately receive. Please accept this offer to secure a positive outcome for you. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 9999
