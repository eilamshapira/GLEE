8000.0,2000.0,"Alice, let's avoid further losses. As you know, waiting hurts us both – my share would depreciate by 10% and yours by 20% each round. By accepting this proposal now, you secure an effective value of 0.8×8000 = 6400, which is at least as good as you'd expect in the next round. I hope we can settle today to preserve as much value as possible for both of us.",Bob,2,
