Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":8000,""bob_gain"":2000,""message"":""Let's settle this fairly. I'm offering you a good amount to start.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's avoid further losses. As you know, waiting hurts us both – my share would depreciate by 10% and yours by 20% each round. By accepting this proposal now, you secure an effective value of 0.8×8000 = 6400, which is at least as good as you'd expect in the next round. I hope we can settle today to preserve as much value as possible for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
