Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 2000, ""alice_gain"": 8000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's avoid further losses. As you know, waiting hurts us both – my share would depreciate by 10% and yours by 20% each round. By accepting this proposal now, you secure an effective value of 0.8×8000 = 6400, which is at least as good as you'd expect in the next round. I hope we can settle today to preserve as much value as possible for both of us.""}"
