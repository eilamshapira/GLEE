550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is a reasonable offer considering we both want to avoid losing value to inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. Inflation is hurting us both. I propose a 60/40 split. I'm bearing the brunt of the inflation risk by waiting, so this compensates me. Consider it carefully.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, I'm willing to adjust my previous offer to give you a bit more. This 52.5/47.5 split is fair and helps us both avoid further inflation losses. Let's conclude this now before we both lose more value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, we are running out of time. I am willing to go down to 55/45. This is as low as I can go. Consider it carefully; inflation is eating away at our potential gains.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
510000.0,490000.0,"Bob, I see we're both concerned about inflation. I'm offering a very fair 51/49 split now. Your inflation rate seems higher than mine, so it's in your best interest to accept this reasonable offer before losing more value. Let's close this deal.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
470000.0,530000.0,"Alice, This is getting ridiculous. The inflation is killing us. I'll take 530k. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
505000.0,495000.0,"Bob, let's be practical. You're losing 67% to inflation while I'm only losing 22%. This nearly equal split of 50.5/49.5 is very generous given our positions. If you reject this, your next round's value will be devastated by inflation. This is a fair deal - take it.",Alice,7,
