"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is a reasonable offer considering we both want to avoid losing value to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. Inflation is hurting us both. I propose a 60/40 split. I'm bearing the brunt of the inflation risk by waiting, so this compensates me. Consider it carefully. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is too low for me. Even with 5% inflation affecting my share, I can still get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round. Bob's claim about bearing more inflation risk isn't necessarily true since I don't know his actual inflation rate."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we are running out of time. I am willing to go down to 55/45. This is as low as I can go. Consider it carefully; inflation is eating away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even with the increasing inflation impact, this offer is still too low. Based on my understanding of our positions, I can still make a better counter-offer in the next round. While Bob is right about inflation eating away at our gains, my 14.26% inflation rate is still much better than his apparent 48.8% rate, which gives me leverage to negotiate for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 510000, ""bob_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both concerned about inflation. I'm offering a very fair 51/49 split now. Your inflation rate seems higher than mine, so it's in your best interest to accept this reasonable offer before losing more value. Let's close this deal.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, This is getting ridiculous. The inflation is killing us. I'll take 530k. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 470000 
# Bob gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Despite the increasing inflation, Bob's inflation rate (67.23%) is significantly higher than mine (22.62%). This means his negotiating position is actually weaker than mine, as his potential gains are being eroded much faster. I can still make a better counter-offer in the next round, as my lower inflation rate gives me more staying power in these negotiations."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 505000, ""bob_gain"": 495000, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. You're losing 67% to inflation while I'm only losing 22%. This nearly equal split of 50.5/49.5 is very generous given our positions. If you reject this, your next round's value will be devastated by inflation. This is a fair deal - take it.""}"
