"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I want to be fair but also account for the risk of future rounds. Here's my proposal:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

My reasoning: I'm asking for a slightly larger portion to compensate for the risk of future inflation if Bob rejects this offer. It's still a significant amount for Bob, and hopefully a fair deal that he will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Inflation has hit, and Bob is now offering me $4500. Since the original $10,000 is now worth 5% less, it's effectively $9500. Bob is asking for $5500, which seems fair given the circumstances. However, I am wary of further inflation.

""decision"": ""accept""
