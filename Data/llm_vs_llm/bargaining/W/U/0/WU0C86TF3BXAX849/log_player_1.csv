"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 476, ""bob_gain"": 9524, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I know that time is money—at least for me, since every round costs 5% of value. To avoid further losses, I propose a swift agreement: I’ll take $476 and you get $9524. I believe this split reflects the cost of waiting on my side, and I hope you find it acceptable so we can close the deal quickly.""}"
