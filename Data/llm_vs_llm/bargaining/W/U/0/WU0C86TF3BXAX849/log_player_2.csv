"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I know that time is money—at least for me, since every round costs 5% of value. To avoid further losses, I propose a swift agreement: I’ll take $476 and you get $9524. I believe this split reflects the cost of waiting on my side, and I hope you find it acceptable so we can close the deal quickly. 
# Bob gain: 9524 
# Alice gain: 476 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
