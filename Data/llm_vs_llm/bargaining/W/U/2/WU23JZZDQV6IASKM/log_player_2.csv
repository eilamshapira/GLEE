"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering I'm making the first move, and if you reject it, we'll both lose value due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
- I can make an offer
- The total amount will be worth 80$ due to 20% inflation
- Even if I propose taking most of it, Alice might reject, leading to further devaluation

2. Current offer gives me 40$, which is:
- A substantial portion
- Guaranteed if I accept
- Better than risking further rounds with inflation

3. Alice's reasoning is somewhat valid:
- First mover consideration
- Highlights inflation risk
- Offer is not extremely unfair

Given that waiting would devalue the total sum to 80$, making it harder to achieve a better outcome for either of us, I'll accept this offer.
