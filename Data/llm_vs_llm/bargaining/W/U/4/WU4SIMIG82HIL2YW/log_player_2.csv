"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Current offer is $40 for me and $60 for Alice
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less for me
   * So $100 in next round is only worth $80 to me
   * And I'd need to propose something Alice would accept

The current offer of $40 is better than potentially getting $50-$60 in the next round (which would only be worth $40-$48 to me due to inflation), and Alice might reject my counter-offer anyway.
