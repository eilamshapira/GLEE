"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob faces a 5% depreciation per round while I don't.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's a reasonably fair starting point
2. If Bob rejects, the next round his $4000 would be worth only $3800 to him
3. It shows I'm willing to give him a substantial portion while maintaining my advantage"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. Here's my reasoning:

1. Bob is offering me less than what I offered him ($4000 vs $4000)
2. Due to inflation affecting Bob but not me, I have a stronger negotiating position
3. Bob's $6000 is actually worth only $5700 to him in this round
4. If we continue, his money will be worth even less in future rounds
5. I can likely get a better deal by making another offer in the next round

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Bob rejected my first offer of 6000/4000 and his money is now worth even less (down 10% from original value), I'll adjust my offer slightly in my favor:

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}

Reasoning:
1. Bob's $3500 in this round is worth approximately $3150 to him due to the 10% cumulative depreciation
2. If he rejects this, his money will be worth even less next round (15% less)
3. This offer still leaves him with a significant amount while acknowledging my stronger negotiating position
4. Time pressure is more on his side due to the inflation effect
5. We still have 9 rounds left, but each round makes Bob's position weaker"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. Here's my reasoning:

1. Bob's $5500 is actually only worth about $4716 to him due to the 14.26% depreciation
2. My negotiating position continues to strengthen as the inflation affects only Bob
3. We still have 8 rounds left, and each round makes Bob's share worth less to him
4. Given that I previously offered a 6500/3500 split, accepting 4500/5500 would be a significant step backward
5. I can make a better counter-offer in the next round

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Bob's money is now worth about 19% less than the original value (compounding the 5% decrease per round), I'll make a stronger offer in my favor:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

Reasoning:
1. Bob's $3000 in this round is worth approximately $2430 to him due to the 19% cumulative depreciation
2. This is actually comparable to getting $3000 in earlier rounds, considering his depreciation
3. If he rejects, his next round's money will be worth about 24% less than original value
4. We still have 7 rounds left, but the time pressure on Bob is increasing significantly
5. This offer reflects my increasingly stronger negotiating position while still leaving Bob with a meaningful amount"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. Here's my reasoning:

1. Bob's $5000 is actually only worth about $3869 to him due to the 22.62% depreciation
2. My negotiating position is even stronger now as inflation continues to affect only Bob
3. Bob seems to be trying a ""fair"" 50-50 split, but due to inflation, it's not actually equal in real value
4. We still have 6 rounds left, and Bob's share will continue to depreciate
5. Given that I previously offered a 7000/3000 split and my position only strengthens with time, accepting a 5000/5000 split would not be optimal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Bob's money is now worth about 27% less than the original value, I'll make an even stronger offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}

Reasoning:
1. Bob's $2500 in this round is worth approximately $1825 to him due to the 27% cumulative depreciation
2. We're now past the halfway point of our 12 rounds
3. Bob has consistently rejected my previous offers, but his negotiating position is significantly weaker now
4. If he rejects, his next round's money will be worth about 32% less than original value
5. Time pressure is heavily on Bob's side now
6. This offer still gives Bob a meaningful amount while reflecting the reality of the depreciation effect
7. Bob should realize that further delays will only reduce his real gains"
