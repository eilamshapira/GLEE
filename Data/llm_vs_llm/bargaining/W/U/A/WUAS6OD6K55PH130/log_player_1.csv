"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $1,000,000. Since I know I face a 10% inflation penalty per round, I should be incentivized to reach an agreement sooner. I'll start with a reasonable offer.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the money equally - $500,000 each. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests and allows us to conclude the negotiation immediately."
