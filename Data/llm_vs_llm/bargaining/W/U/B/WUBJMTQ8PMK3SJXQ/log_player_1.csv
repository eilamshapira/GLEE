"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I'm Alice in this game, I need to be strategic about my first offer. I recognize that time pressure affects me more than Bob due to the 20% inflation per round that only applies to me.

Let me propose a reasonable split:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I believe this is a fair opening offer that gives both of us a significant portion of the money, while accounting for the fact that I'm at a disadvantage due to the inflation penalty that affects only me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that Bob has started with an extremely aggressive offer of taking everything. Let me make a more reasonable counter-offer, considering that with each round my position weakens due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm slightly reducing my request to show willingness to compromise, while still seeking a fair division given the time pressure I face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice that Bob is consistently offering me nothing, which isn't productive for either of us. If we don't reach an agreement by round 12, we both get nothing. Let me try a different approach and offer something that acknowledges my weakening position due to the inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is a perfectly equal split, which is fair despite the inflation disadvantage I face. I hope Bob recognizes that cooperation is better than both of us getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that Bob is continuing to offer me nothing in each round. This strategy isn't leading to a resolution, and we're now more than halfway through our available rounds. Given the significant inflation penalty I'm facing (over 70% by now), I need to make a more accommodating offer.

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I'm now offering Bob the majority of the money to reflect my increasingly disadvantaged position due to inflation, while still ensuring I get something meaningful from this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're now in round 9 of 12, and Bob has consistently offered me nothing while rejecting all my proposals. The inflation penalty means any money I receive is worth significantly less now, but something is still better than nothing. Let me make a more substantial concession.

{""alice_gain"": 25, ""bob_gain"": 75}

I'm offering Bob three-quarters of the money, acknowledging my severely weakened position due to the inflation penalty, while still trying to salvage some value for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","We're down to our last two rounds, and Bob has consistently offered me nothing. At this point, with the extreme inflation penalty I face, even a small amount is better than both of us getting zero in the end. Let me make one more significant concession.

{""alice_gain"": 15, ""bob_gain"": 85}

I'm offering Bob 85% of the money, which is a very generous offer given that we'll both receive nothing if we don't reach an agreement in the next round. This should be much more appealing than the risk of getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
