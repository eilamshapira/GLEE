"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the 10% loss I'll face if we go to another round. Since I need to make this attractive enough for Bob to accept while protecting my interests:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split where I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a fair offer considering that if Bob rejects, the next round will be worth less to me due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept this offer, I get $4,500, but due to 10% inflation, it's only worth $4,050 to me
2. If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less
3. Bob has no inflation penalty, so they are negotiating from a position of strength
4. If I reject, I risk getting an even worse deal in the next round

Given these factors, I will accept this offer. While not ideal, it's better than risking further depreciation of my gains in future rounds.
