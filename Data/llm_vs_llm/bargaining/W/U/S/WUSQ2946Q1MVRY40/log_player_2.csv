"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer.

She is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60. While this isn't an even split, I need to keep in mind that inflation reduces the value by 5% each round. If I reject and we go to the next round, any amount I get will be worth 5% less to me.

Since this is the first round and I still have many chances to negotiate, I'll try to get a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing a split where I get $55 and Alice gets $45. This is slightly in my favor, but not extremely so. I'm hoping Alice will recognize that prolonging the negotiation will cost both of us due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has slightly improved her offer from $40 to $42 for me, while still keeping most of the money for herself. I also just learned important information - inflation affects only my side of the deal, not Alice's. This significantly changes the dynamics of our negotiation.

Given that:
1. Alice's money doesn't lose value over rounds
2. My potential gain decreases by 5% each round (now 9.75% less than round 1)
3. We have 12 rounds total before we both get nothing

Alice clearly has a stronger negotiating position. If we keep rejecting offers, my potential gain will continue to decrease while Alice can afford to wait. However, I still want to try for a better deal than $42.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now that I understand the dynamics better (inflation only affects my gains), I need to make a more compelling offer that Alice might accept, while still trying to get a reasonable share for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split, which is fair and should be attractive enough for Alice to accept. Since inflation only affects my portion and Alice can afford to wait, I'm moving toward a more balanced offer that acknowledges our different positions in this negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is only incrementally improving her offers ($40 → $42 → $43), while my potential value continues to decrease due to inflation. By round 5, my gains are worth 18.55% less than in round 1, and this will continue to worsen.

At this rate, Alice seems to be planning to drag this out, offering minimal improvements while inflation erodes my position. If we continue this pattern through all 12 rounds, I could end up with very little value.

While $43 isn't ideal, the inflation factor makes accepting this offer more reasonable now than it was in earlier rounds.
