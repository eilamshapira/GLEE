"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the rules. I am Bob. I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer or reject it and proceed to the next round. I need to consider the inflation and the dwindling number of rounds.

Here's my thought process:

*   **Alice's offer:** $400,000 for me, $600,000 for her.
*   **Inflation:** If I reject, the money is worth 5% less to me in the next round.
*   **Rounds Remaining:** 12 rounds.
*   **Objective:** Maximize my gain, considering the inflation and the risk of reaching round 13 and getting nothing.

Let's calculate the immediate value after inflation of the current offer and compare it against the ""fair"" splitting of the money.

In the case that I reject, the value I want to compare it with is 500000$.

The value of 400000 at the start is definitely higher than the 5% reduced 500000.

Therefore, for this current round, I accept.
