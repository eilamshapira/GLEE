"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Let me think strategically about this first round offer. Given that I face 5% inflation per round, I should aim to secure a fair deal quickly. However, I also need to consider that Bob might be willing to wait if my offer is too low from his perspective.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for me since I face 5% inflation each round. This is a fair offer considering that waiting would reduce the value for me, and we can both walk away with a good amount right now.""
