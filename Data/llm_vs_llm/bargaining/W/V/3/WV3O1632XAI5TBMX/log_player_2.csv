"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for me since I face 5% inflation each round. This is a fair offer considering that waiting would reduce the value for me, and we can both walk away with a good amount right now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this:

1. Current offer: I get $4,500, Alice gets $5,500
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But my money will be worth 20% less
   * My $4,500 now > $4,500 * 0.8 = $3,600 next round
   * Even if I propose a better split next round, the 20% inflation will hurt me significantly

Alice claims she has 5% inflation, which is much better than my 20%. However, this offer is fairly reasonable - I get 45% of the total amount. Given my high inflation rate, waiting would likely result in a worse outcome for me.
