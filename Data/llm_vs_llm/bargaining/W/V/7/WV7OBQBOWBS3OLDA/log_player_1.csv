"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split while considering that future rounds will reduce my gains due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose taking $550,000 for myself and giving $450,000 to Bob. This is a reasonable split that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept it. If Bob refuses, in the next round the money will be worth 10% less to me, so it's in my interest to make an acceptable offer now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

If I accept Bob's offer:
- I get $450,000 at 90% value = $405,000 effective value
- Bob gets $550,000 at 80% value

If I reject and make a new offer next round:
- The money will be worth another 10% less to me (80% of original value)
- Any future negotiations will mean even more value loss

The current offer gives me $405,000 in effective value, which is still substantial. While I could make a counter-offer next round, the continuing inflation makes that risky, and Bob might reject again, leading to further value loss.
