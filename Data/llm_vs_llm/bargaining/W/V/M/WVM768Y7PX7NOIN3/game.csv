600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because I face a 20% inflation penalty each round, which means waiting costs me significantly more than it costs you. If we go to round 2, my $600k is only worth $480k to me, so I need a larger share now to offset this disadvantage. This deal gives you a substantial $400k right away with no risk.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement before the value decreases further.,Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I see you're seeking a larger share, but my inflation penalty is 20% per round while yours is only 5%. After two rounds, my money has lost 36% of its value while yours has only lost about 10%. My offer of 55-45 is more equitable considering this significant difference in our inflation rates. This gives you $450k immediately, which is better than risking further rounds where both our shares will continue to decrease in value.",Alice,3,

420000.0,580000.0,Let's reach an agreement that considers our respective situations and the ongoing inflation.,Bob,4,

520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, let's be practical here. With each round, I'm losing 20% value while you're only losing 5%. By round 5, my share has already lost over 59% of its original value, while yours has only lost about 19%. My 52-48 split acknowledges our different inflation rates while offering you a very substantial $480k. If we keep going back and forth, we're both losing total value. This is a fair compromise considering our asymmetric inflation rates.",Alice,5,
