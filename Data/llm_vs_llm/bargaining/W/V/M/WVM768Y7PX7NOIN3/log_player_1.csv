"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because I face a 20% inflation penalty each round, which means waiting costs me significantly more than it costs you. If we go to round 2, my $600k is only worth $480k to me, so I need a larger share now to offset this disadvantage. This deal gives you a substantial $400k right away with no risk.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement before the value decreases further. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Bob, I see you're seeking a larger share, but my inflation penalty is 20% per round while yours is only 5%. After two rounds, my money has lost 36% of its value while yours has only lost about 10%. My offer of 55-45 is more equitable considering this significant difference in our inflation rates. This gives you $450k immediately, which is better than risking further rounds where both our shares will continue to decrease in value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's reach an agreement that considers our respective situations and the ongoing inflation. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical here. With each round, I'm losing 20% value while you're only losing 5%. By round 5, my share has already lost over 59% of its original value, while yours has only lost about 19%. My 52-48 split acknowledges our different inflation rates while offering you a very substantial $480k. If we keep going back and forth, we're both losing total value. This is a fair compromise considering our asymmetric inflation rates.""}"
