"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because I face a 20% inflation penalty each round, which means waiting costs me significantly more than it costs you. If we go to round 2, my $600k is only worth $480k to me, so I need a larger share now to offset this disadvantage. This deal gives you a substantial $400k right away with no risk. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, let's consider the implications of the inflation penalty on both of us and the value of the proposal.

Given that Alice faces a 20% inflation penalty each round, her share of $600,000 would indeed decrease to $480,000 by the next round, as she mentioned. This suggests that Alice is trying to secure a larger share upfront to mitigate her losses due to inflation.

On the other hand, I (Bob) face a 5% inflation penalty. This means that if I reject the offer and proceed to the next round, the total amount of money ($1,000,000) would be worth 5% less to me, making it $950,000.

Considering Alice's proposal of a 60-40 split in her favor, where I would get $400,000 and she would get $600,000, I need to weigh this against the potential benefits of waiting.

If I accept the offer, I get $400,000 immediately. If I reject it, I risk losing 5% of the total value in each subsequent round, but I also have the opportunity to propose a more favorable split in the next round or to accept a better offer from Alice if she decides to increase my share to avoid further devaluation of her potential gain.

Given that the difference in inflation rates significantly affects Alice's strategy and that she's offering me $400,000, which is a substantial amount but not necessarily the best I could get considering the rounds ahead and the inflation disparity, I should consider the potential for a better deal in subsequent rounds.

However, it's also important to consider the risk of both of us getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds. Given that this is the first round and the total value of the money has not significantly decreased yet, I have some leverage to negotiate for a potentially better split.

Therefore, my decision for this round is to reject the offer, aiming to negotiate a better split in the subsequent rounds, considering the inflation penalties and the strategic advantage they provide.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that I've rejected Alice's initial offer and considering the inflation penalties, I'll make a proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of the money over time.

Since I face a 5% inflation penalty, the total amount of $1,000,000 is now worth $950,000 to me in this round. However, I'm aware that Alice faces a more significant 20% penalty, which affects her strategy more profoundly.

To make a competitive offer while also considering the risk of future rounds, I'll propose a split that is more favorable to me than Alice's initial offer but still acknowledges her disadvantage due to the higher inflation rate.

My offer for Round 2 is:
- Bob gain: $550,000
- Alice gain: $450,000

Message to Alice: ""Alice, considering the significant inflation penalty you face, I understand the urgency for you to secure a substantial share. However, given that I also lose value over time, albeit at a lower rate, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This offer reflects a balance between the immediate value to both of us and the potential risks of waiting. It's a more equitable distribution considering our respective inflation rates and gives you a considerable amount upfront to offset some of your losses. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement before the value decreases further.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're seeking a larger share, but my inflation penalty is 20% per round while yours is only 5%. After two rounds, my money has lost 36% of its value while yours has only lost about 10%. My offer of 55-45 is more equitable considering this significant difference in our inflation rates. This gives you $450k immediately, which is better than risking further rounds where both our shares will continue to decrease in value. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the current situation and the offers on the table, let's analyze the proposal made by Alice in Round 3.

Alice's offer is for a 55-45 split in her favor, which gives me $450,000 and her $550,000. She argues that this split is more equitable considering the significant difference in our inflation rates. After two rounds, my potential earnings have indeed decreased by about 9.75% (5% in the first round and approximately 4.75% in the second round, due to compounding), while Alice's have decreased by 36% (20% each round).

However, it's crucial to consider not just the past depreciation but also the future potential for negotiation and the impact of inflation on our respective shares in upcoming rounds. Alice's higher inflation rate means she has a stronger incentive to agree on a split sooner rather than later, as each round significantly reduces the value of her potential share.

Given this dynamic, I should consider whether accepting $450,000 now is the best decision, especially since I know Alice is under more pressure due to her higher inflation penalty. If I reject this offer, I risk losing more value in subsequent rounds, but I also maintain the potential to negotiate a better split, considering Alice's increasing desperation as her share's value diminishes more rapidly.

Since we are only in Round 3, and there are 9 rounds left, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Alice's offer, while more generous than her initial proposal, still doesn't fully account for the disparity in our inflation rates and the strategic advantage it gives me.

Therefore, I decide to reject Alice's offer in Round 3, aiming to use the leverage provided by our differing inflation rates to negotiate a more favorable split in subsequent rounds.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that I've rejected Alice's offer in Round 3 and considering the ongoing effects of inflation, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of the money over time and the strategic dynamics between us.

After three rounds, the money I could gain is worth approximately 14.5% less than in the first round (5% in the first round, 4.75% in the second, and about 4.5% in the third, due to compounding), while Alice's potential gain has decreased by about 51.2% (20% in the first round, 20% in the second, and approximately 11.2% in the third, considering her remaining value).

My offer for Round 4 is:
- Bob gain: $580,000
- Alice gain: $420,000

Message to Alice: ""Alice, I understand that your inflation penalty puts you at a disadvantage, and the value of your potential share has decreased significantly. However, I also have to consider the decreasing value of my own share. Given the current state, I'm willing to offer you $420,000, which, despite the inflation, still represents a substantial amount. This offer reflects a balance between our positions, considering the rounds we've gone through and the remaining potential for negotiation. It's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later, but I believe this split better accounts for our respective situations.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical here. With each round, I'm losing 20% value while you're only losing 5%. By round 5, my share has already lost over 59% of its original value, while yours has only lost about 19%. My 52-48 split acknowledges our different inflation rates while offering you a very substantial $480k. If we keep going back and forth, we're both losing total value. This is a fair compromise considering our asymmetric inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the current state of the negotiations and the effects of inflation, let's analyze Alice's offer in Round 5.

Alice proposes a 52-48 split in her favor, offering me $480,000 and taking $520,000 for herself. She argues that this split is a fair compromise, considering the significant difference in our inflation rates and the substantial loss in value her potential share has suffered.

After five rounds, the disparity in our situations due to inflation is indeed pronounced. Alice's share has lost approximately 59.04% of its original value, while mine has lost about 18.55%. This difference in inflation rates gives me a strategic advantage, as I can afford to wait longer for a better offer.

However, it's also important to consider the absolute amounts and the risk of further negotiations. Alice's offer of $480,000 is substantial and represents a significant portion of the original $1,000,000, especially considering the decreased value due to inflation.

Given the current offer and the context, I need to weigh the benefits of accepting $480,000 now against the potential for negotiating a better split in future rounds. While Alice's share continues to depreciate more rapidly, mine also loses value, albeit at a slower rate.

Considering we are halfway through the 12 rounds, and the value of the money continues to decrease for both of us, I believe it's crucial to find a mutually acceptable agreement sooner rather than later. Alice's offer, while not perfectly balanced, does acknowledge the disparity in our inflation rates and offers me a considerable amount.

Therefore, I decide to accept Alice's offer in Round 5, recognizing that $480,000 is a substantial gain, especially under the current circumstances, and that further negotiations might not yield a significantly better outcome.
