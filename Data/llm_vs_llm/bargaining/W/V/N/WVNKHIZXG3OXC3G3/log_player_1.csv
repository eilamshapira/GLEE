"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1, keeping in mind the potential for losses due to inflation in future rounds:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **Bob's offer:** I get $35, Bob gets $65.
*   **My Inflation:** My money is worth 5% less.
*   **Bob's Inflation:** Bob's money is worth 10% less.

If I reject, next round my money will be worth 10% less than round 1, and Bob's will be worth 20% less than round 1.

Let's consider what I might realistically get next round. I'm guessing Bob will offer something around $70 for himself next round to account for inflation, which means I would get $30. My money would be worth 10% less.

$35 with 5% less worth = $33.25 worth in round 1 dollars
$30 with 10% less worth = $27 worth in round 1 dollars

Therefore I should accept.
