"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60
2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   * The money will be worth 10% less for me
   * Only 5% less for Alice
   * But I'll get to make the next proposal

3. If we go to next round:
   * $100 will effectively be worth $90 for me
   * Even if I propose a very favorable split, like 70/30
   * That would give me $63 ($70 * 0.9) in real value
   * Better than $40 from current offer

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me make a strategic offer:

Given that:
1. After this round, the money is worth:
   * 90% of original value for me
   * 95% of original value for Alice
2. If Alice rejects, next round will have further depreciation
3. I need to make it attractive enough for Alice to accept

I'll propose a 65/35 split, which means:
* For me: $65 * 0.9 = $58.5 effective value
* For Alice: $35 * 0.95 = $33.25 effective value

If she rejects, the next round will have even lower values for both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}

I propose this split because it's fair considering the depreciation rates, and it's better for both of us to conclude now rather than continue to future rounds with more value loss."
