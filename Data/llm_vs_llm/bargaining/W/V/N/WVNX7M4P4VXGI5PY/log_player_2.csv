"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. This is a 40-60 split in Alice's favor
3. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less next round
4. I have 11 more rounds possible, but each delay reduces value
5. 40% is less than half, but it's still a significant amount

While I could try to negotiate for more, the 5% inflation penalty means that delaying could cost me money. Even if I got a 50-50 split next round, I'd only get $4,750 (after 5% inflation), which isn't much better than $4,000 now.
