"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, given the money loses value each round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is still worth the same, while Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 55/45 in his favor, and considering the inflation, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this split is more reasonable, don't wait for further devaluation""}"
