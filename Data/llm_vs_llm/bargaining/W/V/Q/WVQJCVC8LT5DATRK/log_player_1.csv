"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account Bob's time pressure due to the 20% inflation penalty per round.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a fair offer that gives me 60% and Bob 40%. Since Bob faces 20% depreciation each round, accepting this offer now would be better than waiting for future rounds where their share would be worth less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $4500
- If I reject, I can make a new offer next round
- Bob faces 20% depreciation per round, while I don't face any
- There are still 10 rounds left
- Bob's proposed split is 45% for me, 55% for them

Given that Bob faces significant time pressure due to inflation and I don't, I'm in a stronger negotiating position. I can get a better deal by making another offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob faces 20% depreciation per round and has already rejected my initial 60-40 split, I'll adjust my offer slightly but maintain a strong position.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}

This offer gives me 65% and Bob 35%. Given that we're now in round 3, Bob's share would be worth even less if they wait longer due to the 20% depreciation per round. It's in their interest to accept soon, as their negotiating power decreases with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze:
- Bob is offering me $4800 (48% of the total)
- For Bob, their $5200 is actually worth only about $2662 due to the 48.8% depreciation
- If I reject, I can make another offer next round
- Bob's money will continue to depreciate by 20% each round
- I still have no depreciation
- 8 rounds remain

Given that Bob's negotiating position is weakening significantly due to the compounding depreciation, and I'm still in a strong position with no depreciation, I can get a better deal by continuing.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that we're now in round 5 and Bob's share has already depreciated significantly (their money is worth less than half of its original value), I'll increase my demanded share further. Bob should be more motivated to accept soon to avoid further depreciation.

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

This 70-30 split might seem aggressive, but considering Bob's time pressure and the significant depreciation they're facing, it's actually reasonable. If they wait longer, their share will be worth even less due to the compounding 20% depreciation per round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze:
- Bob is offering a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
- For Bob, their $5000 is actually only worth about $1638 due to 67.23% depreciation
- We're halfway through (6 rounds out of 12)
- Bob's money will continue to depreciate by 20% each round
- I still have no depreciation
- 6 rounds remain

Given that Bob's negotiating position continues to weaken dramatically (their money is worth less than a third of its original value), and I maintain my strong position with no depreciation, I can still get a better deal by continuing.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that we're in round 7 and Bob's share has depreciated by over 67%, their negotiating position is very weak. Any further delay makes their share worth significantly less. I'll increase my share further to reflect this reality.

{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}

This 75-25 split might seem aggressive, but it's actually reasonable considering:
1. Bob's money has already lost over 2/3 of its value
2. Each additional round reduces their value by another 20%
3. If we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing
4. I have no depreciation pressure

It's in Bob's best interest to accept soon to avoid further significant losses."
