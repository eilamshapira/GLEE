"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Since we both face depreciation over time (10% for me, 20% for Bob), I should consider offering a fair division that incentivizes acceptance now rather than negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest this division because it's reasonably balanced while giving me a slight advantage as the first mover. Bob should consider that if he rejects this offer, we'll move to round 2 where the total value will be worth less to both of us, especially to him with his higher depreciation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. This is a reasonable counter-offer that gives me $45. If I were to reject and move to round 3, the money would depreciate further (my $45 would be worth only about $40.50 in round 1 terms), and I would risk an even less favorable outcome. Given the inflation rates, it's better to secure this amount now rather than continue negotiating."
