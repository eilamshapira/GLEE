"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 60-40 in my favor. Given the inflation rates, this seems fair to start with. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 in round 1
2. My inflation rate (20%) is higher than Alice's (10%)
3. If I reject, the next round's money will be worth less for me
4. My $400,000 in round 1 is better than getting a larger nominal amount in later rounds
5. The split, while not 50-50, isn't terribly unfair given the inflation dynamics

While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of losing value through inflation and the possibility of not reaching an agreement within 12 rounds makes this a reasonable offer to accept in the first round.
