"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. This way we can both walk away with an equal amount before inflation reduces the value. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She proposes a 50-50 split, giving each of us $5,000. This is a fair and equal division that avoids any loss from inflation. While I could try to negotiate for more in the next round, I would risk:
1. Losing 10% of the total value due to inflation
2. Alice potentially making a less favorable offer
3. Extended negotiations that could lead to further value loss

The 50-50 split is a standard fair solution, and accepting it now guarantees a good outcome without risk.
