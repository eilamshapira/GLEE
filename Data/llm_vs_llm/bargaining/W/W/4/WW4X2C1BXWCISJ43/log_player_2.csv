"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $45, keeping $55 for herself. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, Alice will value her share 10% less due to inflation. This means I could potentially make a better offer for myself that Alice might still accept.

If I propose something like 60-40 next round, Alice would actually receive $36 in value (due to 10% inflation), which might be less appealing to her than getting $55 now. Therefore, there's a good chance she would reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and diminishing value for her.

However, $45 is already a fairly reasonable offer, close to a 50-50 split. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's risk in pushing too hard, and this initial offer is decent enough.
