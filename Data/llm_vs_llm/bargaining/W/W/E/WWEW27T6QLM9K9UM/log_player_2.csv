"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer...
- Alice is offering me $49 out of $100
- It's very close to a 50-50 split
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject as well
- This is a reasonable first offer
- The difference is minimal ($2)
- Better to secure a good deal now than risk losing more
