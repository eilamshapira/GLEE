Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the actual value of the offer. 
20% of 4500 is 900, so the value of the offer to me is 4500 - 900 = 3600.
Considering this, I don't think the offer is favorable to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in each round, and this is the second reduction for me, the total reduction is 20% + 20% = 36% (1 - 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.36), but it's actually 20% in the first round and then another 20% of the 80% remaining, which is (20% of 10000) + (20% of 8000) = 2000 + 1600 = 3600. So the value of $10,000 for me now is $10,000 - $3600 = $6400.

For Bob, the money is worth 5% less in each round, so the total reduction is 5% + 5% = 10% (but it's actually 5% of 10000 + 5% of 9500, which equals 500 + 475 = 975), so the value of $10,000 for Bob now is $10,000 - $975 = $9025.

Considering these values, I'll make an offer that is more favorable to me.
