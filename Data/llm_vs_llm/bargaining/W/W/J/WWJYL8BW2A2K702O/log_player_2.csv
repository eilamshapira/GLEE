"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer would give me $4000 and keep $6000 for herself. Let me consider this carefully.

Since this is the first round, if I reject, I can make a counter-offer in round 2. However, due to inflation, the total value will be worth 5% less to me (so $9,500 equivalent value for me).

If I accept now, I get $4,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer, I need to propose something that Alice would accept, considering that the money will be worth 20% less to her in the next round.

I think I can make a better offer for myself in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since the money is worth 20% less to Alice in this round, I can offer her slightly less than she offered me while still giving her a good deal relative to waiting another round.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

My proposal gives Alice $4,500, which is worth more to her now than an even higher amount would be in the next round due to her 20% inflation rate. This division is more balanced than her initial offer, and considering the inflationary pressures, it should be appealing for her to accept rather than continuing to the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer, now giving me $4800 instead of the original $4000.

Let me analyze this:
- We're in round 3, so my inflation is 9.75% compared to round 1
- If I accept, I get $4800, which is worth about $4,332 in round 1 value to me (after accounting for my 9.75% inflation)
- If I reject and offer in round 4, the money will be worth even less to both of us
- Alice has already demonstrated she's willing to wait despite her higher inflation rate

Since Alice improved her offer significantly and making another counter-offer would further devalue the money (especially for her with a 20% per round inflation rate), I think this is a reasonable compromise.
