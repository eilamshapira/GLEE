"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid the impact of inflation (I lose 20% value each round), let's settle quickly with an even split. This way we both secure a fair $50. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer is an even split of $50 each and considering the inflation, it seems like a fair proposal. Accepting this offer would allow me to secure $50 without risking further devaluation of the money due to inflation.
