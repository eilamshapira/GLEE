500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose an equal split: $500000 for you and $500000 for me. Given that my share loses 20% of its value each round, accepting this fair offer now maximizes our returns. Let's secure the full value of the money today rather than risk waiting.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about waiting, but note that while your share loses 20% of its value each round, mine only drops by 5%. To ensure we both secure as much value as possible today and avoid the steep depreciation on your side, I propose we split the money as $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This offer reflects the cost of delay for you and is a fair compromise for both of us. I hope you agree to secure our returns now.",Bob,2,
