"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose an equal split: $500,000 for you and $500,000 for me. Given that my share loses 20% of its value each round, accepting this fair offer now maximizes our returns. Let's secure the full value of the money today rather than risk waiting.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about waiting, but note that while your share loses 20% of its value each round, mine only drops by 5%. To ensure we both secure as much value as possible today and avoid the steep depreciation on your side, I propose we split the money as $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This offer reflects the cost of delay for you and is a fair compromise for both of us. I hope you agree to secure our returns now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
