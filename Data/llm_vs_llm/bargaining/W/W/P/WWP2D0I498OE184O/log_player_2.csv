"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose an equal split: $500000 for you and $500000 for me. Given that my share loses 20% of its value each round, accepting this fair offer now maximizes our returns. Let's secure the full value of the money today rather than risk waiting. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about waiting, but note that while your share loses 20% of its value each round, mine only drops by 5%. To ensure we both secure as much value as possible today and avoid the steep depreciation on your side, I propose we split the money as $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. This offer reflects the cost of delay for you and is a fair compromise for both of us. I hope you agree to secure our returns now.""}"
