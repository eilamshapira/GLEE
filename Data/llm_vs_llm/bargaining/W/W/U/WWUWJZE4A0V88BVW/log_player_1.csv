"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that considers the inflation factor for me while trying to be fair to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, considering the 20% inflation penalty I face each round, I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if we delay, my share becomes less valuable while yours doesn't change. Let's make a deal now so we both walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the inflation penalty affects you more, but I believe a 55-45 split is more reasonable. This way, we both benefit, and I'm not taking advantage of your situation. Let's settle on this before further rounds reduce your share's value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
