"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering the 20% inflation penalty I face each round, I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if we delay, my share becomes less valuable while yours doesn't change. Let's make a deal now so we both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the inflation penalty affects you more, but I believe a 55-45 split is more reasonable. This way, we both benefit, and I'm not taking advantage of your situation. Let's settle on this before further rounds reduce your share's value.""}"
