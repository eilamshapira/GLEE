"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing, so it's becoming more important to secure a deal quickly. 
* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob's previous 50/50 offer suggests he might be feeling the impact of inflation even more strongly than we are. 
* **Compromise:**  While I want to maximize my share, I need to offer Bob a deal that's tempting enough to accept. This offer is a slight increase for me from Round 1, and a smaller decrease for Bob from his Round 2 offer."
