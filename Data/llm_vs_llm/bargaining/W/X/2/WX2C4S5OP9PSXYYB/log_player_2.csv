"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's make this quick: I propose $600k for me and $400k for you. Accepting this offer means we both avoid losing value on each subsequent round, especially since the money devalues more for you. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, let's split the amount equally at $500k each. This way, we both get a fair share. Let me know what you think!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. Considering that the money devalues more for you in each round, I propose $550k for me and $450k for you. This is a win-win, given the circumstances. Hope you see the benefit! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
