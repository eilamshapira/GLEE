"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
- That's a 40-60 split in her favor
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- However, there will be 5% inflation, so the total value will be $9,500
- 40% is not quite fair, as an even split would be 50-50

I'll reject this offer as I believe I can negotiate for a more equitable split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a fair 50-50 split, which is more equitable than Alice's initial offer. Even with the 5% inflation, this would still be better for both of us than prolonged negotiation.
