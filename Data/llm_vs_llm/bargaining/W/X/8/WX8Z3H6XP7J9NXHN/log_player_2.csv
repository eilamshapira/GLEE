"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous in the first round, Bob. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I'll make a more favorable offer to myself to compensate for the potential loss.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it more fairly, considering the decreasing value""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is decreasing Bob, don't be greedy. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $300,000 I would gain is actually worth 36% less than its original value, which is approximately $192,000 in the first round's value. Given this significant decrease, I should accept the offer to avoid further loss.
