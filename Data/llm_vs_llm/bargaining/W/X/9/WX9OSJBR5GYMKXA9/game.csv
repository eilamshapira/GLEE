4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, since you proposed a 90/10 split last round, I think a 60/40 split is fairer. This way, we both get a significant amount, and you still receive a substantial portion despite the inflation affecting your share more.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about fairness. Given that the value of my share is decreasing with each round, I'm offering a slightly better split for you now. This is a 55/45 split, closer to the 60/40 you suggested, and allows us to secure a decent amount for both of us before inflation further reduces the value of my share.",Alice,3,
