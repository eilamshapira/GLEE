"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since you proposed a 90/10 split last round, I think a 60/40 split is fairer. This way, we both get a significant amount, and you still receive a substantial portion despite the inflation affecting your share more. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a 55/45 split, closer to the 60/40 you suggested, and allows us to secure a decent amount for both of us before inflation further reduces the value of my share.""
