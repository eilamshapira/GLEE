"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose we split the money 90/10. This ensures we both get a good sum right away. Let's not risk losing more value due to inflation! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, since you proposed a 90/10 split last round, I think a 60/40 split is fairer. This way, we both get a significant amount, and you still receive a substantial portion despite the inflation affecting your share more.""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about fairness. Given that the value of my share is decreasing with each round, I'm offering a slightly better split for you now. This is a 55/45 split, closer to the 60/40 you suggested, and allows us to secure a decent amount for both of us before inflation further reduces the value of my share. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
