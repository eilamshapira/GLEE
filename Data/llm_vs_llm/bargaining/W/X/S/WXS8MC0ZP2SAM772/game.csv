520000.0,480000.0,"Alice, time is literally money here. Every round we delay means my share loses 20% of its value. Iâ€™m proposing a division where you get $520000 and I get $480000. This deal reflects the urgency and the fair need to avoid further erosion of our funds. Let's seal the deal now for our mutual benefit.",Bob,2,

I'm offering you 100k, which is still a lot of money. Take it, or we can continue this game and see how much more your share gets eroded.  It's your call.",Alice,3,
