"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is literally money here. Every round we delay means my share loses 20% of its value. Iâ€™m proposing a division where you get $520000 and I get $480000. This deal reflects the urgency and the fair need to avoid further erosion of our funds. Let's seal the deal now for our mutual benefit. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm willing to give you a significant share, but 480k is simply too much. I'm offering you 100k, which is still a lot of money. Take it, or we can continue this game and see how much more your share gets eroded.  It's your call.""}
