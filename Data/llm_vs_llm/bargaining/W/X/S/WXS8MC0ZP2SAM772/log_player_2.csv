"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'll take 999k, and you can have 1k.  You get a nice little bonus, and I get the lion's share. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is literally money here. Every round we delay means my share loses 20% of its value. Iâ€™m proposing a division where you get $520,000 and I get $480,000. This deal reflects the urgency and the fair need to avoid further erosion of our funds. Let's seal the deal now for our mutual benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your urgency, but you're trying to take advantage of the situation. I'm willing to give you a significant share, but 480k is simply too much. I'm offering you 100k, which is still a lot of money. Take it, or we can continue this game and see how much more your share gets eroded.  It's your call. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000
