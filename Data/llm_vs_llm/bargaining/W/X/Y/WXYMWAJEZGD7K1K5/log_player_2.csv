"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split. This is a fair offer considering I'm making the first move and taking the initiative. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $40 out of the $100, taking $60 for herself. 

If I reject and move to round 2, I'll get to make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. That means the $100 will effectively be worth only $80 to me in the next round, so even if I managed to get a larger percentage, it might not be worth as much.

Given the inflation penalty and the reasonable initial offer, I think accepting is the strategic choice.
