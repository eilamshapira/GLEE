"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to gamble 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's proposing a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. It's the first round, so there's no inflation impact yet
3. It's a fair offer, but I might be able to get more
4. However, attempting to get more risks:
   - Alice rejecting future offers
   - Value loss through potential inflation for Alice
   - Complete loss if we don't agree within 12 rounds

While I could try to negotiate for more, a 50-50 split is a fair and reasonable offer. Taking it now guarantees a good outcome without risk.
