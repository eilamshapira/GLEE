"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair initial split, considering that I want a good chance of acceptance while accounting for potential inflation risk if negotiations extend.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose to take $55 and give Bob $45. This is a reasonable first offer that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept it, avoiding the inflation penalty in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob offers a 50-50 split
2. Due to inflation, if I accept now:
   * My $50 is worth $45 (10% less)
   * Bob's $50 is worth $40 (20% less)
3. If I reject, I can make another offer, but the money will be worth even less in the next round
4. This is actually a decent offer considering:
   * It's a fair nominal split
   * Even with inflation, I'm getting $45 in real value
   * Waiting longer will only decrease the value further
   * We have limited rounds

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer because it's fair and the inflation penalty will only get worse if we continue negotiating."
