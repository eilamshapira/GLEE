Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm proposing a perfectly fair 50-50 split. Since I face a 20% inflation penalty per round and you don't, waiting longer hurts me more than you. This equal division is the fairest approach for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
