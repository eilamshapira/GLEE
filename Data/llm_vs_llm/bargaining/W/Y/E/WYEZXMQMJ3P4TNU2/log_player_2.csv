"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. Take this offer and we both win. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $30, which is less than half of the total amount. Given that with each passing round, the money is worth 20% less to me, I need to consider whether waiting for a better offer is strategic.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the $100 will be worth only 80% of its original value to me (due to 20% inflation). So a fair 50-50 split would be worth $40 to me in round 2.

I think I can propose a more equitable split in the next round, so I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a strategic offer that accounts for the inflation penalty I face while appealing to Alice's sense of fairness.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing a perfectly fair 50-50 split. Since I face a 20% inflation penalty per round and you don't, waiting longer hurts me more than you. This equal division is the fairest approach for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, time is ticking and that inflation is eating away at your potential gains. I'm being generous, let's close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $35, but with the 36% inflation penalty in round 3, this is effectively worth $35 × 0.64 = $22.40 to me in round 1 terms.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 4, the money will be worth 48% less to me (4 rounds × 20% per round, compounded), meaning even if I could get $50, it would only be worth $26 in round 1 terms.

Alice slightly increased her offer from $30 to $35, recognizing the inflation effect, but she's still keeping a large share. However, given the rapid inflation I face, I need to weigh the diminishing returns of continuing negotiations.

Since I'll face even worse inflation in future rounds, and Alice's offer is a modest improvement, I'll accept this offer.
