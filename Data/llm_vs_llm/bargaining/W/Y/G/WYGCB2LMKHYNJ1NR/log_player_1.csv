**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The money is losing value quickly for me (Alice).  It's crucial to reach a deal soon.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob seems to be aiming for a 50/50 split. My previous offer of 60/40 might have been too aggressive for him.
* **Compromise:** This 55/45 split shows a willingness to negotiate and is still more advantageous for me than Bob's even split, especially considering the inflation working against me."
