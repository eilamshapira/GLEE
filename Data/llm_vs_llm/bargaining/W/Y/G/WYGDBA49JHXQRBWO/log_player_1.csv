"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair for both""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering future rounds depreciate the value for you, here's a slightly better offer for me. It's fair considering your decreasing value. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the decreasing value for me, I'll have to think carefully. However, I still think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the value of the money is decreasing for me, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself to compensate for the loss.

Due to two rounds of inflation, the money I gain is now worth 10% less than the original value (5% less in Round 1 and another 5% less in Round 2). To calculate my offer, I'll consider the decreased value.

Let's assume the original value is $1,000,000. After two rounds of inflation, the value for me is:
$1,000,000 * (1 - 0.05) * (1 - 0.05) = $1,000,000 * 0.95 * 0.95 = $902,500

I'll aim to get at least 50% of this decreased value, which is:
$902,500 * 0.5 = $451,250

However, since the actual value is still $1,000,000, I'll make an offer based on this amount. To get $451,250 in value, considering the inflation, I'll offer:

$1,000,000 * 0.5012 = $501,200 for myself (approximately)

So, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 501200,
  ""bob_gain"": 498800,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a fair offer for both""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With the inflation impact on your side in mind, this offer recognizes that. Let's both come closer to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation reducing the value of my potential gain by 14.26%, I need to carefully consider Bob's offer.

Bob's offer gives me $490,000, which is a significant amount, but I have to think about the decreased value due to inflation. Since the value is decreasing, I might not get a better offer in the next round.

Considering the circumstances, I think Bob's offer is reasonable, and I don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation.
