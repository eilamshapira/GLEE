"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer to avoid prolonging the game due to the inflation factor affecting my share. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

This offer splits the money evenly between us, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of losing value due to inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd receive from Bob's offer is 10% less than the nominal value. So, if I accept, I'd get 350,000 * 0.9 = 315,000 in real value.

Given this, Bob's offer seems quite low, especially since I initially offered an even split. I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round, despite the inflation risk.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob rejected my initial even split and then offered a split that heavily favors him, I'll make a counteroffer that still gives him a significant share but is more balanced than his previous offer. Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 20% less to me (10% less each round), so I need to balance getting a good share with the risk of further devaluation.

My offer for this round, taking into account the two rounds that have passed and the inflation effect, would be:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

This offer gives Bob a bit more than half, acknowledging his rejection of the even split, but also ensures I get a substantial share, considering the diminishing value due to inflation."
