Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 580000 
# Alice gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While not ideal, accepting this offer prevents further losses from inflation. Taking a slightly smaller share now is better than risking getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement in later rounds."
