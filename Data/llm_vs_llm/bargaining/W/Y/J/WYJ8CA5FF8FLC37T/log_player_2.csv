"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40. It's a fair start and we can negotiate from here. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 60-40 split in her favor. While I could accept this and walk away with $40, I have the option to make a counter-offer in the next round that might be more beneficial for me.

Since we have 12 rounds total, there's plenty of room for negotiation, and being the proposer in the next round gives me some advantage. I think I'll try for a more equitable split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging Alice's initial offer.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for starting the negotiation. I think a 50-50 split is the most fair for both of us. We'd both walk away with the same amount, which seems equitable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about we split it 55-45? It's a bit more in my favor, but still fair for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is now proposing a 55-45 split in her favor, which is more reasonable than her initial 60-40 offer. She's moved 5% in my direction, showing willingness to negotiate. 

While I could reject and counter with another offer, I need to consider that we're now in round 3 of 12. If we keep going back and forth with small improvements, we risk using up all rounds. Also, by accepting now, I secure $45 rather than risking getting less or nothing if negotiations break down.

Given that Alice has made a meaningful concession and the offer is reasonably fair, I'll accept.
