6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, let's split it 60/40. This is a fair offer, considering we both want to gain something. Don't let greed cloud your judgement; a bird in hand is worth two in the bush!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I'm proposing a 50/50 split which is the fairest division. While I understand we both face inflation (10% for me, 5% for you), an equal split respects both our interests. If we continue to future rounds, we both lose value - you'd need to offer me more than 4500 next round for me to match what I'd get accepting 5000 now. Let's be efficient and agree to this balanced division.",Bob,2,
