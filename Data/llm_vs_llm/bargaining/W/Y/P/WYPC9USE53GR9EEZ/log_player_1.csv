"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a 50/50 split which is the fairest division. While I understand we both face inflation (10% for me, 5% for you), an equal split respects both our interests. If we continue to future rounds, we both lose value - you'd need to offer me more than 4500 next round for me to match what I'd get accepting 5000 now. Let's be efficient and agree to this balanced division. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
