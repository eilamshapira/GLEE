"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split it 60/40. This is a fair offer, considering we both want to gain something. Don't let greed cloud your judgement; a bird in hand is worth two in the bush! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll carefully consider Alice's offer:

- Alice is proposing I get $4,000 and she gets $6,000
- If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less to me next round
- If we go to the next round, I can make a counter-offer
- However, the 10% inflation for me vs. 5% for Alice puts me at a disadvantage in later rounds

Since I lose more value each round than Alice does, delaying is costly for me. However, this initial 60/40 split in Alice's favor seems quite unbalanced. I believe I can propose a fairer split in the next round that would still be acceptable to both of us despite the inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair counter-offer that accounts for the inflation pressures while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a 50/50 split which is the fairest division. While I understand we both face inflation (10% for me, 5% for you), an equal split respects both our interests. If we continue to future rounds, we both lose value - you'd need to offer me more than 4,500 next round for me to match what I'd get accepting 5,000 now. Let's be efficient and agree to this balanced division.""}"
