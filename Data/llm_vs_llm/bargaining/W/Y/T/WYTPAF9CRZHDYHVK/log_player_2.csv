"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

In the first round, Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, keeping $60 for herself. 

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. So $100 in the next round would effectively be worth $90 to me.

While $40 isn't an equal split, it's still a significant amount. If I reject, I need to consider that:
1. Future rounds will be worth less to me due to inflation
2. Alice might reject my counter-offer
3. We could end up with nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

Given these factors, $40 in hand now is better than risking a higher amount that would be devalued by inflation or possibly getting nothing.
