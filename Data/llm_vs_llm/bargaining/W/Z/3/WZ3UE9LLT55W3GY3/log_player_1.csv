"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 55-45 split is a fairer reflection of our contributions. Let's reach an agreement and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let me explain my thinking: With 10% inflation for me, $450,000 is now worth only $405,000 in terms of round 1 value. I can still make a better offer in the next round, even accounting for further inflation, so I'll reject this and make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
