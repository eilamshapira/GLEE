"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, since my inflation rate is higher (10% vs your 5%), I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me. This way we both get a similar effective value considering our different depreciation rates. Let's settle this early and both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, 
""alice_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation rates, I think a slightly higher share for me is fair since you'll benefit more from settling early. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. With each round, I lose more value due to my higher inflation rate (10% vs your 5%). A 52/48 split is fair considering this difference. If we continue negotiating, we both lose value - I'm already getting 10% less value than in round 1, and you're getting 5% less. Let's agree now and stop the mutual loss. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""I understand your concerns about inflation, but I believe my initial rejection and your subsequent offer show we have room for negotiation. Given the increasing value loss, I'm willing to take a bit more to offset future losses, while still offering you a considerable share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm proposing a 50/50 split which is completely fair. We're already at round 5, and I've lost over 27% of my value while you've lost over 14%. If we don't reach an agreement soon, we both walk away with nothing. This equal division respects both our positions and acknowledges that further delays hurt us both substantially. Let's end this now with a fair split. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
