"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering the 5% inflation penalty per round. I want to establish a cooperative tone while still getting a good outcome.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this division because it gives both of us a substantial amount while slightly favoring me as the first mover. It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting rather than letting inflation eat into the total value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this:
1. Bob's offering a 50-50 split
2. Due to 5% inflation, my $5000 is actually worth $4750 to me
3. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 5% less
4. We've already lost some value to inflation, and further delays will reduce the pie further
5. This is a fairly reasonable offer, and the cost of delay is significant
