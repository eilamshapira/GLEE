"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose a more balanced split where I get 60% and Alice gets 40%. This is much fairer than the previous 20-80 split, and considering the 20% inflation penalty for continuing to the next round, Alice should seriously consider accepting this offer."
