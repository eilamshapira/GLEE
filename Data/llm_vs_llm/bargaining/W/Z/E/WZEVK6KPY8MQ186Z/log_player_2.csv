"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's secure our gains by agreeing on a fair split immediately. A 50-50 division prevents further loss from inflation on my end. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:

1. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. She mentions inflation affecting her, but I know inflation doesn't affect me
3. If I reject, I can make my own proposal next round
4. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I have no pressure to accept quickly
5. I could potentially get a better deal by making a counter-proposal

Given that I have no inflation pressure and could potentially negotiate a better deal, I should reject this offer and make my own proposal next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I know inflation doesn't affect me but seems to affect Alice, I can use this to my advantage. I'll propose a split that's more favorable to me while acknowledging her concern about inflation.
