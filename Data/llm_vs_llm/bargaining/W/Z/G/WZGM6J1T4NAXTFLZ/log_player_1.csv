"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get a substantial amount right away without risking inflation losses.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your previous offer, but I think a fairer split would be 45% for me and 55% for you. This way we both benefit while taking inflation into account. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning for accepting:
1. With 10% inflation on my side, if I reject, my next potential gain would be worth less
2. Getting $550,000 now is better than risking further rounds with increasing inflation
3. Bob's offer is reasonable and acknowledges the need for a slightly higher split in my favor
4. The difference between my initial proposal (60-40) and this one (55-45) is not large enough to justify the risk of continued negotiation with inflation"
