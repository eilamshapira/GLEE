"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to factor in the inflation that affects me each round. I want to secure a good deal early on before inflation eats away at my potential earnings.

Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

Explanation: I am proposing to take $6000 and give Bob $4000. This gives me a slight advantage, but hopefully, it's reasonable enough for Bob to accept it in the first round and avoid further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to think this through.

*   **Bob's offer:** Alice gets $4000, Bob gets $6000.
*   **Inflation:** My potential gains are now worth 20% less than in round 1. Bob's are worth 10% less.

Let's calculate the worth of the money after inflation:

*   **Alice's potential gain worth:** $4000 is the number presented in this round, which represents (100-20)% = 80% of the value in round 1. To find the equivalent value in round 1 dollars, we would divide the round 2 dollars by 0.8, but we do not need it as it's equivalent to $4000 in this round.

Given the limited number of rounds and the ongoing inflation, I should probably accept this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
