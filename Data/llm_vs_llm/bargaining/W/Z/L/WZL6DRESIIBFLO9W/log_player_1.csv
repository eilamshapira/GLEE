"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives Bob a slightly larger share to incentivize acceptance, considering that a rejection would lead to 10% value loss.

{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000}

I propose this split where I get $480,000 and Bob gets $520,000. This is a fair offer that gives Bob a slight advantage, showing good faith in our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:
1. Due to 10% inflation, the real value of my share would be $405,000 ($450,000 * 0.9)
2. This is lower than what I offered in round 1 ($480,000)
3. Bob is trying to get a larger share than what I initially proposed
4. If I reject, we'll lose another 10% to inflation
5. Given we have 10 more rounds, I can still make a counter-offer in the next round

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer as I believe we can reach a more balanced agreement, despite the inflation cost."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since we're now in round 3, the money is worth 80% of its original value due to inflation. I need to consider this while making my offer. I'll make a more compromising offer to try to reach an agreement before further value is lost.

{""alice_gain"": 490000, ""bob_gain"": 510000}

I propose this nearly equal split, where I get $490,000 (worth $392,000 after inflation) and Bob gets $510,000 (worth $408,000 after inflation). This is a very fair offer that should be attractive to Bob, as continuing to negotiate will only reduce the real value for both of us."
