"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to propose a split of the $10,000, keeping in mind the decreasing value of the money for me with each round, while Bob's value remains constant. I'll try to be fair to start, but also account for the inflation I'll face if we go to later rounds.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

My proposal: Alice gets $5500 and Bob gets $4500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob is offering me $4000 in Round 2. Since the money is worth 20% less to me now, this $4000 is actually worth $4000 * 0.8 = $3200 in Round 1 dollars.

I'll reject the offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again. I need to consider that if Bob rejects this offer, the money will be worth even less to me in the next round. It's currently worth 80% of its original value.

I will make an offer that is slightly more generous to Bob than my first offer but still gives me a reasonable amount, considering the inflation.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800}
```

My proposal: Alice gets $5200 and Bob gets $4800."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is $3500. The money is worth 48.8% less to me now, meaning it's worth 51.2% of its original value.

So, $3500 is effectively worth $3500 * 0.512 = $1792 in Round 1 dollars.

This is a very low offer considering the initial amount and the decreasing value for me. I'll reject it.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Alright, it's my turn again. Inflation is really hitting me now. I need to make an offer that Bob finds acceptable, but still gives me something worthwhile. The money is now worth 51.2% of its original value to me.

I will try to be more generous to Bob to increase the chances of acceptance.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

My proposal: Alice gets $5000 and Bob gets $5000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is $3000. The money is worth 67.23% less to me now, which means it's worth 32.77% of its original value.

So, $3000 is effectively worth $3000 * 0.3277 = $983.10 in Round 1 dollars.

This is a very poor offer. I will reject.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, this is getting critical. Inflation is eating away at my potential gains. The money is now only worth 32.77% of its original value to me. I need to make an offer that Bob is very likely to accept, even if it means a smaller share for me.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 4800,
""bob_gain"": 5200}
```

My proposal: Alice gets $4800 and Bob gets $5200."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is $2500. The money is now worth 79.03% less, so it's worth 20.97% of its original value to me.

Therefore, $2500 is effectively worth $2500 * 0.2097 = $524.25 in Round 1 dollars.

This is a terrible offer. I'm still rejecting it.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I'm running out of time and the value of the money is plummeting for me. It's currently worth only 20.97% of its original value. I need to make a very generous offer to Bob to try and secure *something* before it's all gone.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500,
""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

My proposal: Alice gets $4500 and Bob gets $5500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is $2000. The money is now worth 86.58% less, so it's worth 13.42% of its original value.

That means $2000 is effectively worth $2000 * 0.1342 = $268.40 in Round 1 dollars.

It's awful, but I'm running out of rounds. I need to accept something.
