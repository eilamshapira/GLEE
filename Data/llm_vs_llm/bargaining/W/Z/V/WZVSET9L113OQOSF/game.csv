55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that you get $45 and I get $55. Accepting now avoids further losses since waiting reduces the value for both of us (especially for you, with a 10% discount per round). Let's agree now to secure a fair outcome for both parties!",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, considering the higher rate of inflation for me, I propose $60 for myself and $40 for you. This round, the money is worth less for both of us, but especially for me. Let's settle now to minimize our losses.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe we can do better by waiting until round 3, where I get to propose. The current division leaves me with an effective $38 (after discount), which is less favorable than what we might secure by continuing the negotiations. Let's continue the game and try to reach a fairer agreement in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
32.5,67.5,"Hi Bob, in round 3 the inflation has crept up further – my money is now worth 90% of face value and yours only 80%. To avoid even steeper losses down the road, I propose a division where I receive $32.50 and you receive $67.50. That means you effectively secure about $67.50 × 0.80 = $54 while I get $32.50 × 0.90 = $29.25. I believe this deal reflects the pressures of inflation well – you get a better share now rather than risking a lower effective value if we push this further. Let’s settle now for our mutual benefit!",Alice,3,
