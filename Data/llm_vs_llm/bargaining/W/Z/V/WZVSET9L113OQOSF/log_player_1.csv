"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that you get $45 and I get $55. Accepting now avoids further losses since waiting reduces the value for both of us (especially for you, with a 10% discount per round). Let's agree now to secure a fair outcome for both parties!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the higher rate of inflation for me, I propose $60 for myself and $40 for you. This round, the money is worth less for both of us, but especially for me. Let's settle now to minimize our losses. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe we can do better by waiting until round 3, where I get to propose. The current division leaves me with an effective $38 (after discount), which is less favorable than what we might secure by continuing the negotiations. Let's continue the game and try to reach a fairer agreement in the next round.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 32.5, ""bob_gain"": 67.5, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in round 3 the inflation has crept up further – my money is now worth 90% of face value and yours only 80%. To avoid even steeper losses down the road, I propose a division where I receive $32.50 and you receive $67.50. That means you effectively secure about $67.50 × 0.80 = $54 while I get $32.50 × 0.90 = $29.25. I believe this deal reflects the pressures of inflation well – you get a better share now rather than risking a lower effective value if we push this further. Let’s settle now for our mutual benefit!""}"
