"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that you get $45 and I get $55. Accepting now avoids further losses since waiting reduces the value for both of us (especially for you, with a 10% discount per round). Let's agree now to secure a fair outcome for both parties! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the higher rate of inflation for me, I propose $60 for myself and $40 for you. This round, the money is worth less for both of us, but especially for me. Let's settle now to minimize our losses.""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 3 the inflation has crept up further – my money is now worth 90% of face value and yours only 80%. To avoid even steeper losses down the road, I propose a division where I receive $32.50 and you receive $67.50. That means you effectively secure about $67.50 × 0.80 = $54 while I get $32.50 × 0.90 = $29.25. I believe this deal reflects the pressures of inflation well – you get a better share now rather than risking a lower effective value if we push this further. Let’s settle now for our mutual benefit! 
# Bob gain: 67.5 
# Alice gain: 32.5 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
