Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation affecting my share, I propose $55 for me and $45 for you. This seems fair given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
