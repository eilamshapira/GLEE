500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand we both want to conclude this quickly due to inflation. Your initial offer was very unbalanced. I'm proposing an equal 50/50 split which is fair to both of us. This way we both walk away with significant value before inflation erodes it further. Let's be reasonable and finish this now.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I see your point about inflation. I'm upping my offer slightly. Let's do a 55/45 split. This is still favorable for me, but it's a more reasonable compromise than your last offer. Take it!",Alice,3,
