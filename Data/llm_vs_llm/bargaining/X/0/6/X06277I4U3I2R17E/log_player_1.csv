Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand we both want to conclude this quickly due to inflation. Your initial offer was very unbalanced. I'm proposing an equal 50/50 split which is fair to both of us. This way we both walk away with significant value before inflation erodes it further. Let's be reasonable and finish this now. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
