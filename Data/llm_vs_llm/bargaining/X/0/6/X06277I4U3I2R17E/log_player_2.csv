"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 90/10 split. Take it or leave it! I need to secure my share before inflation eats away at everything. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer of a 90/10 split where I would get only $100,000 out of $1,000,000 is quite unfavorable to me. With inflation reducing the value by 20% each round, I should consider the time factor, but this initial offer is too imbalanced. I can make a counter-proposal in the next round that would be more equitable.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer that acknowledges the inflation pressure we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand we both want to conclude this quickly due to inflation. Your initial offer was very unbalanced. I'm proposing an equal 50/50 split which is fair to both of us. This way we both walk away with significant value before inflation erodes it further. Let's be reasonable and finish this now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point about inflation. I'm upping my offer slightly. Let's do a 55/45 split. This is still favorable for me, but it's a more reasonable compromise than your last offer. Take it! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer has improved significantly from the initial 90/10 split to a much more reasonable 55/45 split. With inflation affecting my gains at 36% already, the $450,000 offer is actually worth about $288,000 in original value. If I reject and make a counter-offer, my gains will be worth even less in the next round. Alice's improved offer suggests we're moving toward a fair agreement, and further delays would primarily hurt my position due to the higher inflation rate I'm experiencing.
