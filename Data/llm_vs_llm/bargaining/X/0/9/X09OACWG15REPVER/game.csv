550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount without risking further rounds.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, let's speed up this process. I propose I take 60% and you take 40%.  It's a good deal for you in these early rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, considering the inflation affecting your gains, you should accept this offer now. If we continue further rounds, your potential gains will be worth even less. This is a fair offer given the circumstances.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, let's be realistic. We both know dragging this out hurts us both. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  It's a compromise, and it avoids further losses from inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, the inflation is significantly reducing the real value of your gains. At current inflation levels, this offer actually gives you about 179200 in real value. If you reject and we continue, inflation will reduce your value even more. This is your best option now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, this back and forth is pointless. It's clear the longer this goes on, the more inflation hurts us both. I propose a simple 50/50 split.  Let's end this and walk away with a fair deal.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, let's be practical. With the current 67.23% inflation affecting your gains, even this 250000 offer to you is quickly losing value. If you reject and we continue further, inflation will eat away even more of your potential gains. This is your best chance to walk away with something meaningful.",Alice,7,
