Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's speed up this process. I propose I take 60% and you take 40%.  It's a good deal for you in these early rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Since I know my money doesn't lose value with inflation but Bob's does, I'll make another proposal in the next round. His offer of 400k for me is less than what I proposed initially, and I have the advantage of being immune to inflation effects."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, considering the inflation affecting your gains, you should accept this offer now. If we continue further rounds, your potential gains will be worth even less. This is a fair offer given the circumstances.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. We both know dragging this out hurts us both. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  It's a compromise, and it avoids further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation effect is working in my favor. Bob's real value from his 550,000 is only 281,600 (due to 48.8% inflation) while my potential gains don't depreciate. I can make a better offer in the next round, and the inflation pressure on Bob's side will make him more likely to accept."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, the inflation is significantly reducing the real value of your gains. At current inflation levels, this offer actually gives you about 179,200 in real value. If you reject and we continue, inflation will reduce your value even more. This is your best option now.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this back and forth is pointless. It's clear the longer this goes on, the more inflation hurts us both. I propose a simple 50/50 split.  Let's end this and walk away with a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I will reject this offer because I still have the advantage. Bob's 500,000 is actually worth only about 163,850 in real value due to the 67.23% inflation, while my potential gains maintain their full value. As we progress, my negotiating position gets stronger due to the asymmetric inflation effect. I can propose an even better split for myself in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 750000,
""bob_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. With the current 67.23% inflation affecting your gains, even this 250,000 offer to you is quickly losing value. If you reject and we continue further, inflation will eat away even more of your potential gains. This is your best chance to walk away with something meaningful.""
