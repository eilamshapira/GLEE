"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount without risking further rounds.

# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation affecting your gains, you should accept this offer now. If we continue further rounds, your potential gains will be worth even less. This is a fair offer given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I need to push Alice for a better deal. While the inflation is concerning, accepting a deal this low sets a bad precedent and might encourage her to push for even less favorable terms later."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. We both know dragging this out hurts us both. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  It's a compromise, and it avoids further losses from inflation.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the inflation is significantly reducing the real value of your gains. At current inflation levels, this offer actually gives you about 179200 in real value. If you reject and we continue, inflation will reduce your value even more. This is your best option now. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough decision, as the inflation is clearly impacting my potential gains. However, accepting an offer where I get significantly less than half, even considering the inflation, seems like a losing strategy. I need to show Alice I'm willing to risk it for a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this back and forth is pointless. It's clear the longer this goes on, the more inflation hurts us both. I propose a simple 50/50 split.  Let's end this and walk away with a fair deal.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. With the current 67.23% inflation affecting your gains, even this 250000 offer to you is quickly losing value. If you reject and we continue further, inflation will eat away even more of your potential gains. This is your best chance to walk away with something meaningful. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a brutal blow from the inflation, but I have no choice. Alice is clearly exploiting my position, and continuing means risking even greater losses. Accepting this offer is the least bad option at this point."
