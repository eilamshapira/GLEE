"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that considers the game dynamics, particularly the inflation that affects Bob's payoff but not mine.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I propose I get $700,000 and you get $300,000. This is a reasonable split considering that the money loses value for you with each round due to 5% inflation, while it maintains value for me. If we continue to later rounds, your share would need to be higher to compensate for the inflation you face."
