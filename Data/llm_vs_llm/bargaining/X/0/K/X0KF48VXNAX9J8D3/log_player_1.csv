"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm the first mover. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more reasonable, a 55-45 split is more fair considering we both have equal claim to the money. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
* If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 5% less due to inflation, so effectively $42.75
* If I reject, I can make another offer, but any future money will be worth even less
* The initial value drop is steep, and further delays will keep reducing value
* Bob's offer is relatively fair, and the effective loss isn't too severe yet
