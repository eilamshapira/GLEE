"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, the money is now worth 10% less for me, so the total amount I consider is $100 * 0.9 = $90. I'll make a fair offer, considering the reduced amount.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 19% less for me, which means I'll get approximately 81% of the face value. For the offered $42, I'll get $42 * 0.81 = $34.02.

Given this, I think Alice's offer is still not in my favor. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer again, the money is now worth even less for me due to inflation. Initially, it was 10% less in round 2, and then another 9% less in round 3 (19% total), and now another 10% less, making it a total of 29.1% less (1 - 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9).

The total amount I consider is $100 * 0.709 = $70.90. I'll make an offer, considering the reduced amount.
