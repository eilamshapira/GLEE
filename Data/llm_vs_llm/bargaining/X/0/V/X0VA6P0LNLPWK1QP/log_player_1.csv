"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept, considering the decreasing value of the money each round.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 19.55 
# Bob gain: 80.45 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob's offer is very unfavorable. The total amount is worth $95 now due to inflation. Bob is offering me $19.55 out of $95. I will reject and make a more reasonable offer in the next round.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, the total amount is still notionally $100, but its real value is depreciating. After Round 1 and Round 2, the real value is now 90.25.

I need to make an offer that is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but also gives me a fair share.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this. The money is now worth 85.74. Bob is offering me $40, which is a reasonable portion. I'll accept this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
