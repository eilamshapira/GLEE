I'm holding out for a better offer.  While the value is decreasing, I believe I can get Alice to accept a deal closer to a 50/50 split as the pressure from the shrinking pot increases."

It's time to accept. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and this offer is close enough to my target.  Holding out further is getting too risky."
