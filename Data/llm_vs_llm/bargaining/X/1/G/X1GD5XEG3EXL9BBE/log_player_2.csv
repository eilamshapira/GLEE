"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully given the 5% inflation penalty per round. If I reject, I'll be able to make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total value will be worth less.

Current offer: I get $40 out of $100
If I reject and counter-offer next round: The $100 will be worth $95 to me due to 5% inflation

Let me analyze if I should accept or reject.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counter-offer that's fair but accounts for the inflation I'm facing.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is a fair division that recognizes both of our contributions to the game. While I lost some value due to inflation by rejecting the previous offer, this equal division should be reasonable and acceptable to Alice."
