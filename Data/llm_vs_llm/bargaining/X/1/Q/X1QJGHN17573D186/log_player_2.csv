"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I propose we split the money as $600k for me and $400k for you. Considering inflation, it might be wise to accept this offer early. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual amount I'm considering is $800,000 (1,000,000 * 0.8). To make a fair offer, I'll calculate the split based on this amount.
