"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking initiative. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose a 50-50 split. This way, we both get an equal share, and it's a fair agreement for both parties. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Bob proposes a 50-50 split, but due to inflation, his $50 is actually worth 20% less to him (worth $40 to him), while my $50 maintains its full value. This means the real value split is more favorable to me than it appears.

Since:
1. We still have 10 rounds left, but inflation is increasing
2. The current offer gives me $50 at full value
3. There's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
4. This is actually a good deal for me given the inflation effect
