6000.0,4000.0,Let's split it fairly! I'll take 60% and you get 40%.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, to keep things moving quickly and avoid any further delays, I propose that I take $5500 and you get $4500. A swift agreement benefits us both. What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Okay Bob, let's try this again. Given inflation, I'm adjusting slightly. I'll take $5200, and you get $4800. It's still a pretty good deal for both of us, and we need to finalize this.",Alice,3,

5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I understand the need to finalize an agreement quickly. However, further rounds will only erode the real value of the money you receive due to inflation. To avoid additional loss on your end and to settle this matter promptly, I propose a fair 50-50 split: $5000 for you and $5000 for me. This ensures you secure more real value now than if we drag it out any further. What do you say?",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5100.0,4900.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. I'll take $5100 and you get $4900. We're both close to 50/50, and with each round, my share is worth less. Let's settle this.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Alice, every additional round further erodes the real value of your share due to inflation. Waiting until you propose again means facing a harsher devaluation of your money. To avoid that loss, I'm offering you $4200 (which, under current conditions, is worth significantly more in real terms than what youâ€™d secure by delaying) while I receive $5800. Let's settle now before your effective payoff drops even further.",Bob,6,
