Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the need to finalize an agreement quickly. However, further rounds will only erode the real value of the money you receive due to inflation. To avoid additional loss on your end and to settle this matter promptly, I propose a fair 50-50 split: $5000 for you and $5000 for me. This ensures you secure more real value now than if we drag it out any further. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every additional round further erodes the real value of your share due to inflation. Waiting until you propose again means facing a harsher devaluation of your money. To avoid that loss, I'm offering you $4200 (which, under current conditions, is worth significantly more in real terms than what youâ€™d secure by delaying) while I receive $5800. Let's settle now before your effective payoff drops even further.

# Bob gain: 5800
