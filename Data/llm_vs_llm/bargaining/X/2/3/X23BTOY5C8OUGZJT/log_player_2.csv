This ensures you secure more real value now than if we drag it out any further. What do you say?""}"

Waiting until you propose again means facing a harsher devaluation of your money. To avoid that loss, I'm offering you $4200 (which, under current conditions, is worth significantly more in real terms than what youâ€™d secure by delaying) while I receive $5800. Let's settle now before your effective payoff drops even further.""}"
