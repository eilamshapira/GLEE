550000.0,450000.0,Let's agree on a fair split now! I'm offering you $450000. Time is running out!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but since time affects your gains more than mine (10% inflation vs 0% for me), this is a more equitable split considering our different situations. If we keep negotiating, the total value decreases for you but not for me, so this is actually a fair deal when accounting for our time preferences.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, I understand your point about the inflation affecting me more. However, I'm still taking a significant risk by accepting a lower amount. My offer is now $520000 for me, $480000 for you. This is my best offer, and we need to close this deal before the value drops even more for me. Think about it - you still get a substantial amount, and avoiding further delay is in both our interests.",Alice,3,
