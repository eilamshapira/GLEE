"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but since time affects your gains more than mine (10% inflation vs 0% for me), this is a more equitable split considering our different situations. If we keep negotiating, the total value decreases for you but not for me, so this is actually a fair deal when accounting for our time preferences. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

My offer is now $520,000 for me, $480,000 for you. This is my best offer, and we need to close this deal before the value drops even more for me. Think about it - you still get a substantial amount, and avoiding further delay is in both our interests.""
