"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's agree on a fair split now! I'm offering you $450000. Time is running out! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer from Alice.

Alice is offering me $450,000 out of the $1,000,000, which means she keeps $550,000. While this isn't exactly a 50-50 split, I need to consider our different time preferences.

Since money doesn't lose value for me over rounds (0% inflation), but Alice faces 10% inflation per round, I have a stronger negotiating position. If we go to the next round, I can make a counter-offer, and the total amount will still be worth the full $1,000,000 to me, while it will be worth less to Alice.

This gives me leverage to potentially get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal next round.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic counter-offer based on our different time preferences.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but since time affects your gains more than mine (10% inflation vs 0% for me), this is a more equitable split considering our different situations. If we keep negotiating, the total value decreases for you but not for me, so this is actually a fair deal when accounting for our time preferences.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about the inflation affecting me more. However, I'm still taking a significant risk by accepting a lower amount. My offer is now $520000 for me, $480000 for you. This is my best offer, and we need to close this deal before the value drops even more for me. Think about it - you still get a substantial amount, and avoiding further delay is in both our interests. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's new offer.

Alice is now offering me $480,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is an improvement from her initial offer of $450,000. She's keeping $520,000 for herself.

Key considerations:
- Alice is facing 19% inflation now, making delay more costly for her
- I still face 0% inflation, so time is on my side
- She's moved $30,000 in my direction from her first offer
- We have 9 rounds remaining, and the inflation penalty for Alice will continue to grow

While I could potentially get an even better deal by continuing negotiations, Alice has made a meaningful concession. Her offer is approaching a more reasonable split given our different time preferences. If I reject, there's a risk of extended negotiations that might leave both of us worse off if we fail to reach agreement within the 12 rounds.

I'll accept this improved offer.
