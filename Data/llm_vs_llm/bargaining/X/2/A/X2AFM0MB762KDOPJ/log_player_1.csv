Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since it's still early in the game, how about we split it evenly at 50 each? This way, we both benefit equally and don't lose out to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
