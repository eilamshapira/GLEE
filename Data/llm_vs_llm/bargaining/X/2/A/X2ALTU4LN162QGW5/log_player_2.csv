"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which I believe is fair considering we both want to conclude this quickly to avoid inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
   * I can make a counter-offer
   * But the money will be worth 5% less to me
   * $4,000 now vs. potentially more but worth less later

3. If I reject and propose in the next round:
   * The $10,000 would be worth $9,500 to me
   * Even if I propose a more favorable split, I need to consider that Alice might reject

4. $4,000 now is better than risking a rejection and getting less value due to inflation.

While 60-40 split in Alice's favor isn't ideal, the inflation risk makes accepting this offer the more rational choice.
