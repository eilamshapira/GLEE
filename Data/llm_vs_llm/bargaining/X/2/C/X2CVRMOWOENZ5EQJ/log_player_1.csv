"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more reasonable. Let's go with that! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same, but Bob's offer gives me less, and considering the inflation that affects Bob's gain, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation that affects Bob's gain, I'll make a more favorable offer for myself. Since Bob's gain is worth 20% less in each round, and this is the third round, his gain is now worth 20% * 2 = 40% less than the original value for him, but still 100% for me.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this split favors both of us in the long run.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet halfway and split it evenly. It benefits both of us! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","An even split! Considering the significant inflation that has affected Bob's gain, which is now worth 48.8% less, and the fact that my gain is still worth the same, I think this is a reasonable offer.
