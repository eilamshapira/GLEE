60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is actually a good deal for you because if we go to another round, the $100 will be worth 20% less to you due to inflation, while it maintains full value for me. If you reject and counter-offer, even if you ask for more, the money will be worth less to you overall.",Alice,1,
