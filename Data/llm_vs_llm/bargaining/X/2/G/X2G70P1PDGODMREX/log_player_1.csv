"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob, considering the inflation dynamics. Since Bob faces 20% inflation per round, there's incentive for him to accept reasonable offers now rather than wait.

{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is actually a good deal for you because if we go to another round, the $100 will be worth 20% less to you due to inflation, while it maintains full value for me. If you reject and counter-offer, even if you ask for more, the money will be worth less to you overall.""}"
