"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is actually a good deal for you because if we go to another round, the $100 will be worth 20% less to you due to inflation, while it maintains full value for me. If you reject and counter-offer, even if you ask for more, the money will be worth less to you overall. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's offer.

She's offering me $40 of the $100, while taking $60 for herself. She correctly points out that if I reject, the total amount will be worth 20% less to me in the next round (effectively making the $100 worth only $80 to me).

If I reject and we go to the next round, I would need to secure more than $40/$80 = 50% of the money to do better than accepting her current offer.

This is actually a fair proposition given the inflation penalty I face. If I reject and make a counter-offer, even if I ask for 50% ($50), that would only be worth $50 Ã— 0.8 = $40 to me - exactly what I'd get by accepting now.
