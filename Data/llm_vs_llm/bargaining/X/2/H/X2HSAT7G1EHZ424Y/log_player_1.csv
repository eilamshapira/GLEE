"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to account for inflation. In Round 1, I was offered $600,000. Now, due to 5% inflation, the equivalent value of the money is reduced.

Here's the calculation:

*   Inflation: 5%
*   Alice's gain in round 2 = 300000$

Since I only have the option to accept or reject this offer, I will calculate the utility for myself based on the inflation.
The value is reduced by 5%.
Therefore, the actual value of 300000$ is equivalent to: 300000 * (1 - 0.05) = 285000$
I need to decide whether to accept 285000$ or reject it. I'm likely to get less money in the following rounds.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
