"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives both of us a substantial amount, but slightly favoring myself since I'm making the first move.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This is a fair 60-40 split. I get a bit more as the first mover, but Bob still gets a significant portion of the money."
