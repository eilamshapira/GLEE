Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 2:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000

I'm offering a bit more than 50/50, hoping Alice considers it reasonable given the inflation kicking in."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, hoping to find a point where Alice will accept before the money loses too much value for both of us."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alright, this is getting tense. Inflation is really eating into our potential gains. I need to be more strategic.

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm making a more aggressive offer now. While it might seem unfair, the rapidly decreasing value of the money means I need a larger share to offset the losses. Alice should also consider her own losses if she continues to reject offers."
