"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's kick off with a strong start. I believe this division will benefit us both. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $200,000 out of $1,000,000 (20%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation per round, if I reject:
   * My next round's money will be worth 10% less
   * $1,000,000 in next round = $900,000 in current value
4. 20% is quite low considering we should be aiming for a fair split
5. Even with inflation, I can propose a better split next round

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while considering the inflation effect:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us, and we can avoid further inflation losses by agreeing now.""}

Reasoning:
1. A 50-50 split is fair and harder to reject on principle
2. If Alice rejects, she'll face the same inflation pressure in the next round
3. While my $500,000 would be worth $450,000 in the next round if rejected
4. The message emphasizes fairness and mutual benefit
5. Highlighting the inflation risk creates urgency to accept"
