"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer for dividing the $10,000.

Alice is offering me $4,000 while keeping $6,000 for herself. This is a 40%-60% split in her favor. While it's not an even split, I do get a substantial amount.

I need to consider that if I reject, I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but then Alice could reject that as well. There's a strategic element here about where this negotiation might lead.

Since $4,000 is a significant portion and ensures I walk away with something worthwhile, I'll accept this offer.
