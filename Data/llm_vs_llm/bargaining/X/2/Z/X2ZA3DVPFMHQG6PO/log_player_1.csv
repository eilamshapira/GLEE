"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer that accounts for the inflation effect on my end. Since each round reduces the value of money by 5% for me, I want to reach an agreement quickly while still being reasonable.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which I believe is fair given that I face a 5% inflation penalty per round. This gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my time pressure. I hope we can reach an agreement quickly so we both benefit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see we have different perspectives on what constitutes a fair division. Let me make a more balanced proposal that accounts for the inflation effect I'm experiencing.

{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}

I'm proposing a 52.5-47.5 split, which is more favorable to you than my first offer. Since I face a 5% inflation penalty each round and we're already in round 3, I'm making a more compromising offer. This division gives you a very substantial portion while still accounting for my disadvantage due to inflation. I hope we can reach an agreement now and avoid further devaluation of my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 425000 
# Bob gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice we're moving in opposite directions with our offers while time is reducing the value of my share due to inflation. Let me propose a fair middle ground.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering an equal 50-50 split. This is a completely fair division that gives us both the same amount. Given that we're already in round 5 and I've lost nearly 15% of my money's value to inflation, this represents a significant compromise on my part. I hope you'll recognize this balanced proposal as the fair solution it is, so we can both walk away with a substantial amount rather than continuing this negotiation while my potential gains diminish."
