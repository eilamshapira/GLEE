Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about we meet in the middle? 55/45 acknowledges the inflation impact while still being equitable. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $45 I would gain is now worth only about 40.96% (100% - 59.04%) of its original value, which is approximately $18.43. 

Given the significant decrease in value, I should consider accepting an offer that gives me a relatively stable amount, even if it's not ideal.
