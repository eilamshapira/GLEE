"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to account for the inflation effect that reduces the value by 5% each round if I reject.

If I accept now, I get $50.
If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, even if I get more dollars, those dollars will be worth 5% less to me.

Since this is a fair split and inflation will reduce the value of any future gains, I'll accept this offer.
