"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. I'm offering you 40% because I know we both face inflation, but with each round, the total value decreases for me by 10%. If we take too long to agree, we'll both lose significantly. This is a fair first offer considering these constraints.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally, Alice. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. With inflation affecting us both, it's better to agree soon. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
