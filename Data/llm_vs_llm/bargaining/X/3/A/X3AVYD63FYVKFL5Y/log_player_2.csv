"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. I'm offering you 40% because I know we both face inflation, but with each round, the total value decreases for me by 10%. If we take too long to agree, we'll both lose significantly. This is a fair first offer considering these constraints. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
