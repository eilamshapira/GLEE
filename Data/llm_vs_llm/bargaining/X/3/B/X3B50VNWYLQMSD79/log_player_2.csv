Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 8046, ""alice_gain"": 1954} 

Let me explain briefly my reasoning. Since we’re now in round 2—with the pot effectively “shrunk” by 5% (so $10,000 becomes worth $9,500 in real terms)—I calculated the subgame‐perfect equilibrium by backward induction. In a discounted alternating‐offers game with 12 rounds remaining, the responder’s value if they reject (and then get to propose in round 3) sets the minimum they will accept in round 2. Working backwards from round 12 (where the proposer can claim almost everything) to round 2, I found that Bob’s “effective” share in round 2 should be about $7,642.6 (of the $9,500 real value) and Alice’s about $1,857.4. Converting these “real‐value” amounts into the round‑2 nominal numbers (by dividing by 0.95) yields approximately $8046 for Bob and $1954 for Alice. 

Please note that these figures are approximate, but they capture the strategic division that ensures Alice is just indifferent between accepting now or rejecting and waiting to propose in round 3."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 8360, ""alice_gain"": 1640} 

To explain briefly my reasoning in round 4 in present‐value terms (i.e. relative to round 1’s $10,000):

1. The total pie in round 4 is nominally $10,000 but its real (present) value is 10,000×0.95³ ≈ 8574.
2. Working by backward induction from round 12 (where the proposer – and in that case Bob – could claim almost everything) back to round 4, we determine each player’s continuation value. For example, in round 5 (where Alice would propose), her equilibrium payoff (in round‑1 dollars) comes out to about 1406. That is, if Alice rejects a round‑4 offer, she can expect to secure roughly 1406 in present value.
3. To make Alice just indifferent between accepting and waiting, Bob must offer her a share that, when “undiscounted” to round 4 nominal dollars, gives her 1406 present‐value dollars. Since round 4’s discount factor is ≈0.8574, the required nominal offer for Alice is 1406/0.8574 ≈ 1640.
4. The remaining nominal amount, 10,000 – 1640 = 8360, is retained by Bob.

Thus, my equilibrium offer in round 4 is to propose that Bob gets $8360 and Alice gets $1640."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

To explain briefly: Even though Alice’s current proposal offers me a nominal $4800 (which is worth about $4800 × 0.8145 ≈ $3909.6 in round‑1 terms), my continuation value—as the next proposer in round 6—is estimated to be higher in present‐value terms. By rejecting this offer, I expect to secure an even more favorable split once I make my proposal, given the standard backward‐induction outcomes in such alternating offers games under discounting."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 8670, ""alice_gain"": 1330}

In round 6 the overall pie is still $10,000 in nominal terms, but due to inflation it’s worth only about 77.38% of its original value (i.e. about $7,738 in round‑1 purchasing power). Using backward induction, I determine Alice’s continuation value if she rejects—i.e. the value she can secure as proposer in round 7 (with even lower effective value due to further discounting). In equilibrium, I must offer her just enough (in nominal terms for round 6) so that her discounted payoff here equals her expected payoff if she waits.

Based on the pattern we’ve seen in previous rounds (for example, in round 2 my offer left her with $1,954 and in round 4 with $1,640 nominal, reflecting the decline in the available value), the calculations indicate that Alice’s minimum acceptable nominal amount in round 6 is roughly $1,330. This ensures that in round‑1 dollar terms her value is preserved relative to waiting for the subsequent round. Accordingly, I claim the remaining $8,670."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

My reasoning is as follows: Although Alice’s proposal offers a nominal 5000 for me, its real value in terms of round‑1 dollars is only about 5000 × 0.7351 ≈ 3676. In round 7 my effective payoff would be 3676 in round‑1 value if I accept. However, by rejecting this balanced offer, I obtain the right to propose in round 8. In equilibrium (using a backward‑induction argument over the remaining rounds with further discounting), my continuation value as the proposer in round 8 is expected to yield a higher present‑value payoff than 3676 in round‑1 dollars. Therefore, rejecting is the optimal choice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 9096, ""alice_gain"": 904}

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning for round 8:

1. At round 8 the pie is still $10,000 nominal, but its round‑1 real value is 10,000×0.95⁷ ≈ 6,983. In order to determine how little I can offer Alice while keeping her indifferent to waiting, I worked backward from the later rounds.

2. In round 9 (if Alice were to propose), by a standard alternating‐offers equilibrium argument in this 12‑round game with a 5% per round discounting, Alice’s equilibrium proposal would leave her with roughly $951 nominal while giving Bob about $9049 nominal. (The calculations use the fact that moving one round further discounts payoffs by a factor of 0.95, so ratios between what a responder gets and what they could secure by becoming proposer involve that factor.)

3. To make Alice indifferent in round 8, I must offer her a nominal amount y such that her round‑1 value if accepting, y×0.95⁷, equals the round‑1 value she expects from waiting until round 9 (which would be approximately 951×0.95⁸). Since 0.95⁸/0.95⁷ = 0.95, the calculation simplifies to y ≈ 951×0.95 ≈ 903.7. Rounding to whole dollars gives about $904 to her.

4. That leaves me with 10,000 – 904 = 9096 nominal dollars.

Thus, my equilibrium offer in round 8 is to propose that I (Bob) get $9096 and Alice gets $904."

Round 9

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5200

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Explanation:
At round 9, the nominal offer gives me $5200, but when discounted by the round‐specific factor (0.95⁸ ≈ 0.6634), its present value is about 5200 × 0.6634 ≈ $3449 in round‑1 dollars. If I reject this offer, I become the proposer in round 10. Working backward (using the standard alternating‐offers logic with a 5% per‐round discount rate), my expected continuation value in round 10 is much higher in present‑value terms – on the order of over $5700 in round‑1 dollars. Consequently, I reject the current offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 9525, ""alice_gain"": 475}

Here's my reasoning for round 10:

1. At round 10 the nominal pie is $10,000, but its value in round‑1 dollars is discounted by 0.95^(9) ≈ 0.6303. Hence, every nominal dollar in round 10 is worth about $0.6303 in round‑1 terms.

2. If Alice rejects my offer in round 10, she becomes the proposer in round 11. In round 11 the pie’s discount factor is 0.95^(10) ≈ 0.5987. By backward‑induction, as proposer in round 11 Alice would need to give me (the responder) exactly what I would get in round 12. In round 12 (when I’d be the proposer), I could claim nearly all of the pie (leaving Alice virtually nothing). This makes my continuation value as a responder in round 11 approximately 9500 nominal dollars (since 9500 × 0.5987 ≈ 5688 in round‑1 dollars, which is what I’d get in round 12).

3. Consequently, as the proposer in round 10 I must offer Alice an amount that makes her indifferent between accepting now and waiting to propose in round 11. In round 11, as proposer, she would secure the residual: 10000 – 9500 = 500 nominal dollars, which in round‑1 dollars are worth 500 × 0.5987 ≈ 299.4. Therefore, her equivalent reservation in round 10 must satisfy:
  (alice_gain in round 10) × 0.6303 ≈ 299.4.
Solving for alice_gain:
  alice_gain ≈ 299.4 / 0.6303 ≈ 475 nominal dollars.

4. Thus, offering Alice $475 nominal leaves me with 10000 – 475 = 9525 nominal dollars. In round‑1 value these become:
  Alice: 475 × 0.6303 ≈ 299.4
  Bob: 9525 × 0.6303 ≈ 6003.6,
which is optimal given my continuation prospects.

Therefore, my equilibrium offer in round 10 is:
{""bob_gain"": 9525, ""alice_gain"": 475}."

In round 11, the nominal offer gives me $5500, which in round‑1 value is about 5500 × 0.5987 ≈ $3293. Meanwhile, if I reject, I become the proposer in round 12 where (since it is the final round) I can secure almost the entire $10,000 pie—albeit discounted by about 0.5688—yielding roughly 10,000 × 0.5688 ≈ $5688 in round‑1 value. Since $5688 is significantly higher than $3293, it is optimal for me to reject Alice’s offer in round 11."
