"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. I'm being offered $4,000 out of $10,000
2. If I reject, we go to next round where I can make an offer
3. However, for me, the money will be worth 20% less next round
4. If I reject, the $10,000 will effectively be worth $8,000 for me in the next round
5. 40% of $10,000 now ($4,000) is better than making an offer with $8,000 effective value next round
