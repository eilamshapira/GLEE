"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I want to be fair but also make sure I get a good deal considering I'm making the first offer.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5250,
""bob_gain"": 4750
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4875 
# Bob gain: 5125 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the inflation and Bob's offer. It's close to what I initially proposed for myself, but I need to factor in the 5% loss. Let's calculate:

*   My initial proposal: $5250
*   5% loss: $5250 * 0.05 = $262.50
*   My initial proposal adjusted for inflation: $5250 - $262.50 = $4987.50

Bob is offering $4875. It's a bit less than my adjusted value, but close. To avoid further inflation and the risk of getting less in the next round, I'll accept.
