"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. If I reject, I can make my own offer in the next round
3. Alice's money will be worth 5% less next round (while mine stays the same)
4. This means in the next round, $500,000 will only be worth $475,000 to Alice
5. I could potentially leverage this to get a better deal for myself

Since I'm in a stronger position due to Alice's time pressure (her money loses value each round while mine doesn't), I should reject this offer and propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money will be worth 5% less in the next round if she rejects, I can propose a split that's more favorable to me while still being attractive enough for her to accept rather than move to the next round.

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Given that waiting another round will cost you 5% of the money's value, this split is actually better for you than rejecting and getting less value next round. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation affecting my share, this offer is a compromise. It's more than what you offered last round and still fair given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is offering me $550,000 and taking $450,000
2. This is better for me than her initial 50-50 split
3. However, if I reject:
   - I can make another offer next round
   - Alice's money will be worth about 15% less than initial value
   - I could potentially get an even better deal
4. But there's risk in prolonging:
   - Alice might become more resistant
   - We might lose value in continued negotiation
   - $550,000 is already a good outcome for me

Given that this is a significant improvement from the initial offer and a reasonable compromise, I'll accept. Further negotiation might lead to diminishing returns and risk of worse outcomes.
