"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60/40 split in favor of myself. Since I'm losing value with each round due to inflation (20% per round), it's reasonable for me to get a slightly larger share now. This gives you a solid $40 while allowing me to protect against the diminishing value I face if we delay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
