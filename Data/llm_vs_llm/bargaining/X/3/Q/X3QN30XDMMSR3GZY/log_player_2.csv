Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I think we can still find a more equitable split considering the impact of inflation. I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor, which is a reasonable compromise given our differing inflation rates. Let's try to reach an agreement before the value of our potential gains diminishes further.

# Alice gain: 5500
