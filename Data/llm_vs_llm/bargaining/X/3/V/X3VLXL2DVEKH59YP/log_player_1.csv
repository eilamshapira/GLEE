"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer to divide the $10,000, considering that we should both aim to maximize our gains while remembering that inflation will reduce the total value if we don't reach an agreement quickly.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of $5,000 each. This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a substantial amount without risking value loss due to inflation in subsequent rounds."
