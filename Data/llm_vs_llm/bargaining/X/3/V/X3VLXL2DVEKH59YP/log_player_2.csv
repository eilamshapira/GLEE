"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer to split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000.

This is a fair 50-50 split, which is reasonable. If I reject and we go to the next round, the total amount will decrease by 5% to $9,500. Even if I were to propose a more favorable split for myself in the next round, the decrease in total value needs to be considered.
