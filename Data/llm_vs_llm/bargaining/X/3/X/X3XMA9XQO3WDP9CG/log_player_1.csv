"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer to Bob. Since we're both starting fresh and I want to avoid multiple rounds of negotiation (which would reduce the total amount due to inflation), I'll propose a slightly favorable but not overly greedy split.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a fair offer where I get a small advantage as the first mover, but it's not so unfair that Bob would likely reject it. I'm offering Bob a substantial 45% of the total amount, which is significantly better than what game theory might suggest for a traditional ultimatum game."
