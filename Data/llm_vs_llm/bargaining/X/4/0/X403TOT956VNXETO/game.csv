55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is slightly in my favor, but fair considering that with each round, your money loses 10% value. If we go to another round, you'll need to propose a split where your $45 would only be worth $40.5 to you. Let's settle now for an efficient outcome.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, I understand your point, but considering the decreasing value of money for me, I think a fair split would be 50/50. This way, we both get an equal share, and I can minimize the impact of inflation. Let's settle for an efficient and fair outcome now.",Bob,2,

60.0,40.0,"Bob, I understand you want an equal split, but we need to consider the inflation factor. With each round, your money loses 10% value. If we go to another round after this, your $40 would only be worth $36 to you. I'm offering you $40 now, which is better than what you'd effectively get if we continue negotiating. Let's settle on this fair split considering our different inflation rates.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, I understand your perspective, but considering the cumulative effect of inflation on me, I need to secure more value now. I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This might seem unfair at first, but remember that the money I receive is worth 28% less than it was originally. Let's settle for this, considering the impact of inflation on me.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, I understand you're concerned about the inflation affecting your gains. However, requesting 60% for yourself doesn't account for the overall game dynamics. At this point, the $35 I'm offering you is worth about $25.50 to you due to inflation. If we continue to the next round, any amount you'd receive would be worth even less. This offer maximizes our combined value - please consider accepting so we can both walk away with something worthwhile rather than continuing this negotiation where we both lose value.",Alice,5,
