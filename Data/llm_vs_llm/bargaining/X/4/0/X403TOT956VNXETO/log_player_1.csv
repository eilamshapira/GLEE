"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is slightly in my favor, but fair considering that with each round, your money loses 10% value. If we go to another round, you'll need to propose a split where your $45 would only be worth $40.5 to you. Let's settle now for an efficient outcome.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point, but considering the decreasing value of money for me, I think a fair split would be 50/50. This way, we both get an equal share, and I can minimize the impact of inflation. Let's settle for an efficient and fair outcome now. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want an equal split, but we need to consider the inflation factor. With each round, your money loses 10% value. If we go to another round after this, your $40 would only be worth $36 to you. I'm offering you $40 now, which is better than what you'd effectively get if we continue negotiating. Let's settle on this fair split considering our different inflation rates.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but considering the cumulative effect of inflation on me, I need to secure more value now. I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This might seem unfair at first, but remember that the money I receive is worth 28% less than it was originally. Let's settle for this, considering the impact of inflation on me. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're concerned about the inflation affecting your gains. However, requesting 60% for yourself doesn't account for the overall game dynamics. At this point, the $35 I'm offering you is worth about $25.50 to you due to inflation. If we continue to the next round, any amount you'd receive would be worth even less. This offer maximizes our combined value - please consider accepting so we can both walk away with something worthwhile rather than continuing this negotiation where we both lose value.""}"
