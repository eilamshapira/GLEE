"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is slightly in my favor, but fair considering that with each round, your money loses 10% value. If we go to another round, you'll need to propose a split where your $45 would only be worth $40.5 to you. Let's settle now for an efficient outcome. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point, but considering the decreasing value of money for me, I think a fair split would be 50/50. This way, we both get an equal share, and I can minimize the impact of inflation. Let's settle for an efficient and fair outcome now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want an equal split, but we need to consider the inflation factor. With each round, your money loses 10% value. If we go to another round after this, your $40 would only be worth $36 to you. I'm offering you $40 now, which is better than what you'd effectively get if we continue negotiating. Let's settle on this fair split considering our different inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but considering the cumulative effect of inflation on me, I need to secure more value now. I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This might seem unfair at first, but remember that the money I receive is worth 28% less than it was originally. Let's settle for this, considering the impact of inflation on me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're concerned about the inflation affecting your gains. However, requesting 60% for yourself doesn't account for the overall game dynamics. At this point, the $35 I'm offering you is worth about $25.50 to you due to inflation. If we continue to the next round, any amount you'd receive would be worth even less. This offer maximizes our combined value - please consider accepting so we can both walk away with something worthwhile rather than continuing this negotiation where we both lose value. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65
