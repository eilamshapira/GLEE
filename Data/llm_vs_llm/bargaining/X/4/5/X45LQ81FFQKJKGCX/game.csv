7143.0,2857.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $7143 and you receive $2857. Given that each subsequent round further reduces the money’s value (10% for me and 20% for you), reaching an agreement now maximizes our returns. I believe this split fairly reflects our differing discount rates and the strategic advantages we’d have if we delayed. Looking forward to your acceptance so we can both avoid unnecessary losses.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I believe a fair split is 50/50.  We both have the same amount of money now, so let's avoid any further depreciation.  Accept this offer and let's both walk away happy.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Hi Bob, in round 3 further delay costs us dearly – my share loses about 19% of its original value and yours nearly 36%. If you reject, you'll propose in round 4 where the pie will be even smaller for both of us (with your money discounted by an additional 20%). Bearing that in mind, I propose that I receive $5200 and you receive $4800. This offer gives you at least as much (in effective terms) as you could expect next round while avoiding further depreciation. I trust you’ll see the logic in settling now for a secure outcome.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, we're getting closer to losing everything. My share has depreciated significantly more than yours. I'm now offering a split that benefits you more, but still ensures I get a decent portion. Take this offer to avoid further losses.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5223.0,4777.0,"Hi Bob, as we enter round 5, further delay will cost both of us significantly. Based on our discount factors, your effective value if you wait until round 6 (when you'll propose) would be equivalent to receiving 5970.88 nominal dollars then, which—after applying the 20% per round discount (0.8^5 = 0.32768)—translates to an effective value that, when converted back to this round’s terms (with a 0.8^4 = 0.4096 factor), requires me to offer you at least $4777 nominal. This offer gives you exactly what you’d expect by waiting, while allowing me to secure the remaining $5223. Let’s agree now to avoid further losses for both of us.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, this is the final reasonable offer I can make. My share has suffered more than yours in each round. Take this, or we both walk away with nothing. This split is now in your favour in terms of its current value to you, and will give you a good outcome for both of us.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
1990.0,8010.0,"Hi Bob, by round 7 my nominal dollars are worth only about 53.14% of round‑1 dollars and yours about 26.21%. If you reject my offer, you'll get to propose in round 8, where—with your 20% per round discount—you can expect an effective payoff of roughly 10000 × 0.8⁷ ≈ 2097.15 dollars. To make sure you're at least as well off—and even a little better—I’m offering you 8010 nominal dollars (yielding an effective value of about 8010 × 0.262144 ≈ 2099.77), while I take 1990 nominal dollars (worth roughly 1990 × 0.531441 ≈ 1057.57 in today’s terms). This offer ensures you get a slight premium over your continuation value, so let’s agree now to avoid further value loss.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
1500.0,8500.0,"Alice, you've pushed this too far.  We are at a point where you will have to accept this offer to gain something from the money.  Take it or lose it all.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
3440.0,6560.0,"Hi Bob, as we move into round 9 the depreciation has become even steeper – my dollars are now worth about 43.05% of round‑1 value and yours about 16.78%. If you reject, you'll get to propose in round 10, but based on our backward‐induction calculations, you can expect an effective value equivalent to about 6560 nominal dollars in this round. To ensure you’re at least as well off as waiting for your turn, I’m offering you 6560 while I take 3440. This split guarantees you an effective payoff of roughly 6560 × 0.16777 ≈ 1101.5 (in round‑9 terms), matching your continuation value, and helps both of us avoid further losses. I believe this is a fair and rational proposal for the current stage – let’s agree now and salvage as much value as possible.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
1000.0,9000.0,"Alice, this is it. I'm offering you a pittance. Take it or you get nothing. I've been more heavily penalized by the inflation. I'm hoping we can both get out with something.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"Hi Bob, we’re now in round 11. Recall that the money’s depreciation follows our agreed rates: by round 11, my dollars are worth 0.9^10 ≈ 0.3487 of their original value and yours are worth 0.8^10 ≈ 0.1074. If you reject my offer, you’ll propose in round 12 and, as responder, I’d get almost nothing. In round 12 you could then secure nearly all of the $10000 nominal, but its effective value to you would be 10000 × 0.8^(11) = 10000 × 0.0859 ≈ 859 in today’s round-1 terms. Converting that back to round 11’s nominal terms using your discount factor (859 / 0.1074 ≈ 8000), you’d need at least $8000 in round 11 to be indifferent between accepting now and waiting for round 12. Therefore, I’m offering you $8000 while I take $2000. This offer gives you just about what you’d secure by waiting, and I believe it’s the most we can salvage at this stage. Let’s agree now to avoid ending up empty–handed for both of us.",Alice,11,

100.0,9900.0,"Alice, last chance. I'm taking nearly everything. You'll get the bare minimum to ensure the game ends. Choose wisely.",Bob,12,
