Given that each subsequent round further reduces the money’s value (10% for me and 20% for you), reaching an agreement now maximizes our returns. I believe this split fairly reflects our differing discount rates and the strategic advantages we’d have if we delayed. Looking forward to your acceptance so we can both avoid unnecessary losses.""}"

Round 2

Bob's offer:

Round 3

If you reject, you'll propose in round 4 where the pie will be even smaller for both of us (with your money discounted by an additional 20%). Bearing that in mind, I propose that I receive $5,200 and you receive $4,800. This offer gives you at least as much (in effective terms) as you could expect next round while avoiding further depreciation. I trust you’ll see the logic in settling now for a secure outcome.""}"

This offer gives you exactly what you’d expect by waiting, while allowing me to secure the remaining $5223. Let’s agree now to avoid further losses for both of us.""}"

To make sure you're at least as well off—and even a little better—I’m offering you 8,010 nominal dollars (yielding an effective value of about 8,010 × 0.262144 ≈ 2,099.77), while I take 1,990 nominal dollars (worth roughly 1,990 × 0.531441 ≈ 1,057.57 in today’s terms).

To ensure you’re at least as well off as waiting for your turn, I’m offering you 6,560 while I take 3,440. This split guarantees you an effective payoff of roughly 6,560 × 0.16777 ≈ 1,101.5 (in round‑9 terms), matching your continuation value, and helps both of us avoid further losses.

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 2000, ""bob_gain"": 8000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, we’re now in round 11. Recall that the money’s depreciation follows our agreed rates: by round 11, my dollars are worth 0.9^10 ≈ 0.3487 of their original value and yours are worth 0.8^10 ≈ 0.1074. If you reject my offer, you’ll propose in round 12 and, as responder, I’d get almost nothing. In round 12 you could then secure nearly all of the $10,000 nominal, but its effective value to you would be 10,000 × 0.8^(11) = 10,000 × 0.0859 ≈ 859 in today’s round-1 terms. Converting that back to round 11’s nominal terms using your discount factor (859 / 0.1074 ≈ 8000), you’d need at least $8000 in round 11 to be indifferent between accepting now and waiting for round 12. Therefore, I’m offering you $8000 while I take $2000. This offer gives you just about what you’d secure by waiting, and I believe it’s the most we can salvage at this stage.
