"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $7143 and you receive $2857. Given that each subsequent round further reduces the money’s value (10% for me and 20% for you), reaching an agreement now maximizes our returns. I believe this split fairly reflects our differing discount rates and the strategic advantages we’d have if we delayed. Looking forward to your acceptance so we can both avoid unnecessary losses.

# Alice gain: 7143

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 3 further delay costs us dearly – my share loses about 19% of its original value and yours nearly 36%. If you reject, you'll propose in round 4 where the pie will be even smaller for both of us (with your money discounted by an additional 20%). Bearing that in mind, I propose that I receive $5200 and you receive $4800. This offer gives you at least as much (in effective terms) as you could expect next round while avoiding further depreciation. I trust you’ll see the logic in settling now for a secure outcome.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we enter round 5, further delay will cost both of us significantly. Based on our discount factors, your effective value if you wait until round 6 (when you'll propose) would be equivalent to receiving 5970.88 nominal dollars then, which—after applying the 20% per round discount (0.8^5 = 0.32768)—translates to an effective value that, when converted back to this round’s terms (with a 0.8^4 = 0.4096 factor), requires me to offer you at least $4777 nominal. This offer gives you exactly what you’d expect by waiting, while allowing me to secure the remaining $5223. Let’s agree now to avoid further losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4777 
# Alice gain: 5223

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, by round 7 my nominal dollars are worth only about 53.14% of round‑1 dollars and yours about 26.21%. If you reject my offer, you'll get to propose in round 8, where—with your 20% per round discount—you can expect an effective payoff of roughly 10000 × 0.8⁷ ≈ 2097.15 dollars. To make sure you're at least as well off—and even a little better—I’m offering you 8010 nominal dollars (yielding an effective value of about 8010 × 0.262144 ≈ 2099.77), while I take 1990 nominal dollars (worth roughly 1990 × 0.531441 ≈ 1057.57 in today’s terms). This offer ensures you get a slight premium over your continuation value, so let’s agree now to avoid further value loss.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we move into round 9 the depreciation has become even steeper – my dollars are now worth about 43.05% of round‑1 value and yours about 16.78%. If you reject, you'll get to propose in round 10, but based on our backward‐induction calculations, you can expect an effective value equivalent to about 6560 nominal dollars in this round. To ensure you’re at least as well off as waiting for your turn, I’m offering you 6560 while I take 3440. This split guarantees you an effective payoff of roughly 6560 × 0.16777 ≈ 1101.5 (in round‑9 terms), matching your continuation value, and helps both of us avoid further losses. I believe this is a fair and rational proposal for the current stage – let’s agree now and salvage as much value as possible.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 89.26% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 65.13% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, we’re now in round 11. Recall that the money’s depreciation follows our agreed rates: by round 11, my dollars are worth 0.9^10 ≈ 0.3487 of their original value and yours are worth 0.8^10 ≈ 0.1074. If you reject my offer, you’ll propose in round 12 and, as responder, I’d get almost nothing. In round 12 you could then secure nearly all of the $10000 nominal, but its effective value to you would be 10000 × 0.8^(11) = 10000 × 0.0859 ≈ 859 in today’s round-1 terms. Converting that back to round 11’s nominal terms using your discount factor (859 / 0.1074 ≈ 8000), you’d need at least $8000 in round 11 to be indifferent between accepting now and waiting for round 12. Therefore, I’m offering you $8000 while I take $2000. This offer gives you just about what you’d secure by waiting, and I believe it’s the most we can salvage at this stage. Let’s agree now to avoid ending up empty–handed for both of us.
