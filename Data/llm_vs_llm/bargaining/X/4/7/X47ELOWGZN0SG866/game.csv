55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob! I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself because my inflation rate (10%) is lower than yours (20%), meaning we should finish sooner for both our benefits. This split is fair considering our different time preferences.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I need a larger share to compensate for my higher rate. This offer is more beneficial for me, and still reasonable. Let's finish this quickly before the money devalues further!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, let's be truly fair with a 50-50 split. Our inflation rates don't change the fact that we're dividing the same $100. With your 20% inflation rate, it's in your best interest to finish this quickly, and a 50-50 split is the fairest way to do that. This way we both walk away with equal shares before inflation takes more away from both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
35.0,65.0,"Alice, I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the decreasing value of the money. My inflation is hurting me more, and I need a larger share to make it worth my while. Take this offer, it's better than getting nothing in the long run!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
45.0,55.0,"Bob, we're already in round 5, and the value is decreasing significantly for both of us - your share has already lost almost 50% of its value! I've compromised by offering you the majority (55%) while ensuring I get a fair portion too. This is my final reasonable offer - if we keep going, we'll both end up with much less value. Let's conclude this now before we both lose more to inflation.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, the longer we wait, the less both of us will receive. I'm raising my offer again. Accept this to avoid a worse outcome for both of us. This is my best offer, I cannot go lower than this.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
42.0,58.0,"Bob, this is becoming detrimental to both of us. I've made another concession, offering you 58% of the total - more than fair considering we're now in round 7. Your inflation rate is 20% per round, meaning your share has already lost over 70% of its original value! Even with this larger percentage, you're getting much less actual value than if you had accepted earlier. I strongly urge you to accept this offer before we both end up with nothing of value.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
28.0,72.0,"Alice, We are getting closer to the end of the game, and the money is losing value with each round. I am offering you a share that is slightly above the last offer you made. If you want to walk away with something, accept my offer now.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
40.0,60.0,"Bob, we're approaching the end rapidly - only 4 rounds left. At this point, your 20% inflation rate has reduced your share's value by over 80%! I'm making a significant concession by offering you 60% of the total. This is fair and reasonable. Remember, if we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get NOTHING. Please be rational and accept this offer - further negotiation will only hurt us both severely.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
25.0,75.0,"Alice, we are running out of time. My inflation is a lot higher than yours. I am offering you a share, this offer is better than nothing. Do not let both of us end up with nothing.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
35.0,65.0,"Bob, this is the FINAL opportunity for a reasonable compromise. We have only ONE round left after this. If we don't agree, we BOTH GET NOTHING. I've conceded to give you 65% - a significant majority. Your inflation rate means even with this larger percentage, you're getting minimal value compared to earlier rounds. Be rational - 65% of something is infinitely better than 100% of nothing, which is what we'll both get if you reject again.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
22.0,78.0,"Alice, this is our last opportunity. Accept my offer. If you don't, we both get nothing. I offered you a reasonable amount of money. Make a choice.",Bob,12,
