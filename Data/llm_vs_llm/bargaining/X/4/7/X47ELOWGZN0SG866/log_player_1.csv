"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer that takes into account our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself because my inflation rate (10%) is lower than yours (20%), meaning we should finish sooner for both our benefits. This split is fair considering our different time preferences.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I need a larger share to compensate for my higher rate. This offer is more beneficial for me, and still reasonable. Let's finish this quickly before the money devalues further! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be truly fair with a 50-50 split. Our inflation rates don't change the fact that we're dividing the same $100. With your 20% inflation rate, it's in your best interest to finish this quickly, and a 50-50 split is the fairest way to do that. This way we both walk away with equal shares before inflation takes more away from both of us.""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the decreasing value of the money. My inflation is hurting me more, and I need a larger share to make it worth my while. Take this offer, it's better than getting nothing in the long run!

# Bob gain: 65

""bob_gain"": 55, 
""message"": ""Bob, we're already in round 5, and the value is decreasing significantly for both of us - your share has already lost almost 50% of its value! I've compromised by offering you the majority (55%) while ensuring I get a fair portion too. This is my final reasonable offer - if we keep going, we'll both end up with much less value. Let's conclude this now before we both lose more to inflation.""}"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 42, 
""bob_gain"": 58, 
""message"": ""Bob, this is becoming detrimental to both of us. I've made another concession, offering you 58% of the total - more than fair considering we're now in round 7. Your inflation rate is 20% per round, meaning your share has already lost over 70% of its original value! Even with this larger percentage, you're getting much less actual value than if you had accepted earlier. I strongly urge you to accept this offer before we both end up with nothing of value.""}"

""bob_gain"": 60, 
""message"": ""Bob, we're approaching the end rapidly - only 4 rounds left. At this point, your 20% inflation rate has reduced your share's value by over 80%! I'm making a significant concession by offering you 60% of the total. This is fair and reasonable. Remember, if we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get NOTHING. Please be rational and accept this offer - further negotiation will only hurt us both severely.""}"

""message"": ""Bob, this is the FINAL opportunity for a reasonable compromise. We have only ONE round left after this. If we don't agree, we BOTH GET NOTHING. I've conceded to give you 65% - a significant majority. Your inflation rate means even with this larger percentage, you're getting minimal value compared to earlier rounds. Be rational - 65% of something is infinitely better than 100% of nothing, which is what we'll both get if you reject again.""}"
