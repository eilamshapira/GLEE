"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself because my inflation rate (10%) is lower than yours (20%), meaning we should finish sooner for both our benefits. This split is fair considering our different time preferences. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2

  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I need a larger share to compensate for my higher rate. This offer is more beneficial for me, and still reasonable. Let's finish this quickly before the money devalues further!""

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be truly fair with a 50-50 split. Our inflation rates don't change the fact that we're dividing the same $100. With your 20% inflation rate, it's in your best interest to finish this quickly, and a 50-50 split is the fairest way to do that. This way we both walk away with equal shares before inflation takes more away from both of us. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're already in round 5, and the value is decreasing significantly for both of us - your share has already lost almost 50% of its value! I've compromised by offering you the majority (55%) while ensuring I get a fair portion too. This is my final reasonable offer - if we keep going, we'll both end up with much less value. Let's conclude this now before we both lose more to inflation.

# Alice gain: 45

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is becoming detrimental to both of us. I've made another concession, offering you 58% of the total - more than fair considering we're now in round 7. Your inflation rate is 20% per round, meaning your share has already lost over 70% of its original value! Even with this larger percentage, you're getting much less actual value than if you had accepted earlier. I strongly urge you to accept this offer before we both end up with nothing of value.

# Alice gain: 42

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're approaching the end rapidly - only 4 rounds left. At this point, your 20% inflation rate has reduced your share's value by over 80%! I'm making a significant concession by offering you 60% of the total. This is fair and reasonable. Remember, if we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get NOTHING. Please be rational and accept this offer - further negotiation will only hurt us both severely.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 89.26% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 65.13% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is the FINAL opportunity for a reasonable compromise. We have only ONE round left after this. If we don't agree, we BOTH GET NOTHING. I've conceded to give you 65% - a significant majority. Your inflation rate means even with this larger percentage, you're getting minimal value compared to earlier rounds. Be rational - 65% of something is infinitely better than 100% of nothing, which is what we'll both get if you reject again.
