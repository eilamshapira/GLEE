"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10000$, I need to consider the inflation effect. If I reject, the total value will decrease by 5% for me in the next round, meaning the 10,000$ would be worth 9,500$ to me. This means even if I got a better percentage in the next round, the absolute amount might be lower.

Also, I need to consider that Alice faces even higher inflation (10%), which gives me some negotiating leverage in the next round.

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, as 4000$ is less than half of the total.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced counteroffer, considering the inflation factors. Since Alice faces higher inflation (10%), she has more incentive to reach an agreement sooner. However, I also need to be reasonable to increase chances of acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a division where I receive $5,500 and Alice receives $4,500. This is a fair proposal considering that we both face inflation, and the total amount is still better for both of us if we agree now rather than continuing to negotiate while the value decreases."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is now proposing an even 50-50 split of $10,000. However, due to inflation:

For me, the money is now worth 9.75% less than in round 1, so $5,000 now is equivalent to about $4,513 in round 1 value.

If I reject and we go to round 4, the money will be worth even less (approximately 14.75% less than round 1 for me), further reducing the effective value of any amount I might receive.

Alice has moved from offering me 40% to now offering 50%, which is a significant improvement. Given the inflation factors and the fact that a 50-50 split is objectively fair, I should accept this offer.
