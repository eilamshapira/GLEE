"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split, which gives us both an equal share of the money. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer of a 50-50 split. It's a fair and equal division that follows standard norms of fairness. Since this is the first round and the offer is equitable, accepting would be a reasonable choice. If I reject, I could propose a different split in the next round, but there's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable offer to me, and we might both end up worse off.
