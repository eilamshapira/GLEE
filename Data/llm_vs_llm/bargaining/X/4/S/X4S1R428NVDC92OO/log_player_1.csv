"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll lose more value by waiting.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a significant share, but I expect a more balanced split. Considering the decreasing value, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $40.5
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount will be worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob
- Even if Bob accepts my next offer, I'd need to propose getting significantly more than $50 to match what I can get now
- Given the higher inflation rate affecting me, delaying is more costly for me than for Bob
