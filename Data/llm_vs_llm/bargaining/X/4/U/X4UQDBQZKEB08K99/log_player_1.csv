"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, I make the first move. This is a good deal for you to avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect on me, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, the $40 offered to me is actually worth $40 * 0.8 = $32 to me.

Given this, I'm not satisfied with the offer. I'll reject it and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation effect, the total amount of $100 is now worth $100 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $64 to me.

To make a reasonable offer, I'll aim to get a bit more than half of the original $100, taking into account the inflation. However, I'll also try to be fair and leave some room for negotiation.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground before inflation eats away too much""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking, Alice. I'm offering a reasonable split while we still have something worthwhile to divide. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection from Bob. Now, considering the inflation effect on me, the money I gain is worth 20% less in each round, so:

Round 1: 100%
Round 2: 80%
Round 3: 64%
Round 4: 51.2%

The $45 offered to me is actually worth $45 * 0.512 = $23.04 to me.

Given this significant decrease in value, I'm inclined to accept Bob's offer, as it might be better than risking further inflation losses.
