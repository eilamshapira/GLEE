"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair - I propose a 60-40 split, which is reasonable considering you have a higher inflation rate than me.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, we both get the same amount, and we can avoid the effects of inflation. If we continue, we both risk getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to inflation, my $500,000 is now worth $450,000 (10% less)
2. Bob's share is worth $400,000 to him (20% less)
3. If I reject, I can make another offer, but the money will be worth even less in the next round
4. A 50-50 split is objectively fair, and getting something now is better than risking further depreciation
