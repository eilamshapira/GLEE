Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering you face 5% inflation per round, so accepting now is better than waiting.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with a 60-40 split. Let's be a bit more equitable. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, considering the inflation I'll face in future rounds. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45,
