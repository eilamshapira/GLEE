Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering you face 5% inflation per round, so accepting now is better than waiting.

# Alice gain: 60

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's meet in the middle. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. With your 5% inflation per round, delaying further will only reduce the real value of your share. This is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
