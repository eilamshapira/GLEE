Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $3448 and you receive $6552. Considering that waiting costs me 10% per round and you only 5%, this split reflects our time‐preferences in an efficient agreement. I hope you’ll agree to secure the best value now rather than delay and lose more value later. 
# Bob gain: 6552 
# Alice gain: 3448 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
