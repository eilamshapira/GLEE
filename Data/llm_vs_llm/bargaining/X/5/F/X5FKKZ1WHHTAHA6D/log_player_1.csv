"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll play as Alice and make my first offer to divide the $1,000,000.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split where we both get $500,000. This is a fair division that gives us both significant value without the risk of further inflation reducing our total amount."
