"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and end this quickly 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. Alice proposes I get $45 while she gets $55
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the total amount will be worth 5% less ($95 total)
3. Her proposal is slightly in her favor but not extremely unfair
4. The difference between our shares ($10) is less than what we'd lose to inflation by continuing

While I could try to negotiate for a more equal split, the risk of losing value through inflation makes accepting this reasonable offer the better choice.
