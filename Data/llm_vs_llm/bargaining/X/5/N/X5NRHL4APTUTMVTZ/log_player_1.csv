"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slightly advantageous offer for myself (60/40) but it's not too greedy to hopefully encourage Bob to accept it right away, considering the diminishing value of the money as rounds progress. I hope Bob considers this a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer. He's proposing $45 for me and $55 for himself.

Since this is round 2, the money I would gain is worth 10% less than in round 1. So, $45 in round 2 is equivalent to $45 / 0.9 = $50 in round 1 terms (approximately).

Bob's money is worth 20% less, so his $55 is equivalent to $55 / 0.8 = $68.75 in round 1 terms (approximately).

This means, in round 1 equivalent, Bob's asking for more than me. I will reject the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again. Remembering the inflation, I'll try to balance a good offer for myself with an incentive for Bob to accept.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35
}
```

Rationale:

*   I'm increasing my take a bit, acknowledging the inflation.
*   I am starting to feel like time is running out, so I will ask for a bigger share.
*   Hopefully, Bob will still find $35 acceptable, considering his money is also losing value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is offering a 50/50 split. Let's analyze this with the inflation in mind.

My money is worth 27.1% less than round 1. So, $50 in round 4 is equivalent to $50 / (1 - 0.271) = $50 / 0.729 = $68.59 (approximately) in round 1 terms.

Bob's money is worth 48.8% less than round 1. So, his $50 is equivalent to $50 / (1 - 0.488) = $50 / 0.512 = $97.66 (approximately) in round 1 terms.

This means, adjusted to round 1 value, Bob would still be getting way more than I do. Therefore, I must reject the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, time is definitely ticking. Let's factor in the significant inflation and make an offer that hopefully Bob can't refuse, while still giving me a reasonable return.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

Rationale:

*   Further increased my share to compensate for the rapidly increasing inflation for Alice.
*   Trying to make it as appealing as possible for Bob to just take it, since every round lowers the value.
*   Even though it may seem greedy, the inflation is punishing us both."
