"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Currently offered: $40 for me, $60 for Alice
2. If I reject, next round I can make an offer, but:
   * My money will be worth 20% less (so $100 would become worth $80)
   * Alice's money will be worth 10% less (so $100 would become worth $90)
3. This means I could offer a different split next round, but we'll both lose some value
4. A 40/60 split isn't terrible, considering we have inflation pressure

While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of losing value through inflation and potential continued negotiation makes this offer somewhat reasonable. However, I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me make a strategic offer:

The money is now worth 20% less to me and 10% less to Alice compared to round 1. I need to account for this while still making an attractive offer that Alice might accept to avoid further depreciation.

I'll propose a slightly more balanced split, but still favoring me since I'm making the offer:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because:
1. It gives me a better share than Alice's initial offer
2. It's still reasonable enough that Alice might accept to avoid further value loss
3. If Alice rejects, we both lose more value in the next round"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $35 for me, $65 for Alice
2. With current inflation:
   * My $35 is worth even less (36% less than round 1)
   * Real value for me: $35 * 0.64 = $22.40
3. If I reject:
   * Next round inflation will be worse (about 49% for me, 27% for Alice)
   * I could make another offer, but the total value keeps decreasing
4. Alice's new offer is actually worse than her first offer ($40)
5. We're already in round 3 of 12, but the value is deteriorating quickly

Since Alice has actually decreased her offer to me (from $40 to $35) despite inflation affecting us both, and since we still have rounds remaining to negotiate, I will reject this offer. I believe we can reach a better agreement.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me make a strategic offer considering the current situation:

1. Money is now worth 49% less for me and 27% less for Alice compared to round 1
2. Alice has shown she's willing to play hardball by actually reducing her offer
3. However, we both need to reach an agreement before round 12
4. I need to make an offer that's attractive enough to accept given the increasing inflation

I'll make a more compromising offer to try to reach an agreement before we lose too much value:

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose this even split because:
1. It's a fair proposition that might appeal to Alice's sense of fairness
2. Given the rapid value deterioration, a fair split now is better than a potentially better split later
3. It's a clear improvement for Alice from my last offer (45)
4. The even split might help break the cycle of declining offers"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: $30 for me, $70 for Alice
2. With current inflation:
   * My $30 is worth 59.04% less than round 1
   * Real value for me: $30 * 0.4096 = $12.29
3. Alice has progressively decreased her offers ($40 → $35 → $30)
4. We're in round 5 of 12, and the value is deteriorating rapidly
5. If I reject:
   * Next round inflation will be even worse
   * My negotiating position keeps getting weaker due to higher inflation rate

Although Alice's offer is getting worse, my bargaining power is decreasing faster than hers due to the asymmetric inflation rates. If this pattern continues, I might end up with even less. Given the severe inflation impact and that we're approaching the halfway point of our rounds, I should accept this offer.
