"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. BUT, due to inflation:
   * My money will be worth 20% less next round
   * Alice's money will be worth 10% less next round
4. This means if I reject:
   * $500,000 now > $500,000 Ã— 0.8 = $400,000 next round
   * I'm at a disadvantage in negotiations due to higher inflation rate

Given that I have a higher inflation rate (20% vs 10%), waiting will hurt me more than Alice. This 50-50 split is actually quite fair, and waiting will only reduce my purchasing power.
