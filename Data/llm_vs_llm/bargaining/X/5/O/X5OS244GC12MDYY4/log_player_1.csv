"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but since I'm facing 10% inflation each round and you aren't, a more equitable split would give me a bit more. This offer is fair given our different situations. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering Bob's situation with the 10% inflation, I understand his point. However, I still want to ensure I get a fair share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not in my favor and he's facing inflation, I'll try to make a more reasonable offer.

{""alice_gain"": 525000, 
""bob_gain"": 475000, 
""message"": ""Considering your inflation, let's meet in the middle, 52.5/47.5 seems fair""}"
