"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000. If I reject and we go to the next round, I'll face a 10% inflation penalty, meaning my purchasing power will decrease. However, I would have the opportunity to make a counter-offer.

Let me analyze if this is a good deal given the inflation constraints. If I reject, the $1,000,000 will be worth 10% less to me in the next round, so effectively we'd be dividing $900,000 of value from my perspective (while still $1,000,000 from Alice's perspective).

Since this is just the first round and the offer gives me less than half, I think I should make a counter-proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I should make a reasonable counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation pressure I face while still trying to get a fair share.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but since I'm facing 10% inflation each round and you aren't, a more equitable split would give me a bit more. This offer is fair given our different situations.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your inflation, let's meet in the middle, 52.5/47.5 seems fair 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this new offer. Alice is now proposing I get $475,000 while she gets $525,000. Due to inflation, the money I would receive is worth 19% less than in round 1, so my $475,000 is effectively worth about $384,750 in round 1 terms.

Alice has moved significantly from her initial 60/40 split to a more equitable 52.5/47.5 split, which shows she's willing to negotiate. If I reject, we'll move to round 4, where I'll face 27.1% inflation (1-(0.9^3)), further reducing the value of any money I receive.

This is a reasonable improvement from her first offer and acknowledges the inflation disadvantage I face. Given the increasing inflation penalty and the fact that we're making progress toward a fair agreement, I should accept this offer.
