"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair deal""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight advantage for me, but still a good deal for you. The money is now worth 10% less for you, so consider that in your decision. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll calculate the actual value I'd get:

45 * 0.9 = 40.5

Given this, I think I can do better. My response is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, and this is the third round, I'll calculate the value I'd get:

Let's say I offer x dollars to myself. Due to two rounds of inflation (20% less), the actual value I'd get is:
x * 0.8

To maximize my gain, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 52, 
""bob_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""My last reasonable offer, consider the inflation""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair deal considering the inflation effect on Alice. It's still a good offer for you, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 30% less after 3 rounds (10% less each round, so 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.729, which is approximately 27.1% less), I'll calculate the actual value I'd get:

40 * 0.729 = 29.16

Given this, I think I should accept this offer, as the inflation is significantly reducing the value of any potential future gains. My response is:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
