"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Given the different inflation rates for Alice (20% per round) and Bob (10% per round), it makes sense to propose a fair division that considers these differences.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the $10,000, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a fair starting point that respects both our interests."
