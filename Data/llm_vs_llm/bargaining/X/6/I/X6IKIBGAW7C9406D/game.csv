400000.0,600000.0,Hi Alice – I'm proposing a fair split that acknowledges both of our interests. I'll take $600000 and you'll get $400000. I believe this division benefits us both considering the diminishing value of the money in the upcoming rounds. Let's wrap this up early and ensure a good outcome for us both.,Bob,2,

195000.0,805000.0,"Hi Bob, in this round the total pot is effectively 640000 when accounting for inflation. If you wait until round 4, you could propose a split and expect to secure about 512000 effective dollars for yourself. With this offer, you’d receive 805000 nominal, which translates to approximately 515200 effective dollars – a slight improvement over your waiting prospect. I believe this is a fair compromise that saves us both further losses. What do you say?",Alice,3,
