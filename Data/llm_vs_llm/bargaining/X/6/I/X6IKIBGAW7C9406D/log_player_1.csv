"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice – I'm proposing a fair split that acknowledges both of our interests. I'll take $600000 and you'll get $400000. I believe this division benefits us both considering the diminishing value of the money in the upcoming rounds. Let's wrap this up early and ensure a good outcome for us both. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 195000, ""bob_gain"": 805000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in this round the total pot is effectively 640,000 when accounting for inflation. If you wait until round 4, you could propose a split and expect to secure about 512,000 effective dollars for yourself. With this offer, you’d receive 805,000 nominal, which translates to approximately 515,200 effective dollars – a slight improvement over your waiting prospect. I believe this is a fair compromise that saves us both further losses. What do you say?""}"
