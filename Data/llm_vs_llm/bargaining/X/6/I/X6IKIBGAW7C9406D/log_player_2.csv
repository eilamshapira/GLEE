"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – I’m proposing a division that reflects our future bargaining prospects given the devaluation over time. If you accept now, you get $386098, which is at least as good as waiting another round. Let’s agree and avoid further losses – what do you say? 
# Bob gain: 386098 
# Alice gain: 613902

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice – I'm proposing a fair split that acknowledges both of our interests. I'll take $600,000 and you'll get $400,000. I believe this division benefits us both considering the diminishing value of the money in the upcoming rounds. Let's wrap this up early and ensure a good outcome for us both.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in this round the total pot is effectively 640000 when accounting for inflation. If you wait until round 4, you could propose a split and expect to secure about 512000 effective dollars for yourself. With this offer, you’d receive 805000 nominal, which translates to approximately 515200 effective dollars – a slight improvement over your waiting prospect. I believe this is a fair compromise that saves us both further losses. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 805000 
# Alice gain: 195000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
