Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money after inflation:

For Bob:
- Original value: $500,000
- Inflation: 9.75%
- Value after inflation: $500,000 - ($500,000 * 0.0975) = $500,000 - $48,750 = $451,250

For Alice:
- Original value: $500,000
- Inflation: 19%
- Value after inflation: $500,000 - ($500,000 * 0.19) = $500,000 - $95,000 = $405,000

Given the inflation, it might be better to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation.
