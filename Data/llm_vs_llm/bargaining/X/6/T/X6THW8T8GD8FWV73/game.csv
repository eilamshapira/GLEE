600000.0,400000.0,Hi Bob! I'll take $600000 and you get $400000. This seems fair to me as I am making the first proposal.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
310320.0,689680.0,"Hi Alice, here's my proposal: I take $689680 and you get $310320. By waiting another round you’d become the proposer, but due to our respective discounting – 5% for me and 10% for you per round – you’d end up worse off. I believe this division reflects our discounted future values fairly. What do you think?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Hi Bob! I propose I take $350000 and you take $650000. Given the inflation effects, I believe this is a fairer split now while still reflecting your advantage as the second proposer.",Alice,3,
,,"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, by rejecting your proposal I would be stepping into the proposer’s role in the next round, which—despite the further inflation—I expect will allow me to secure a higher effective value. As such, I must reject your proposal.",Bob,3,reject
310347.0,689653.0,"Hi Alice,

Here’s my proposal for this round: I take $689653 and you get $310347. If you choose to reject, you'll be the proposer next round, but due to our respective discounting — your money losing value at 10% per round and mine at 5% — you'll only secure what amounts to roughly $310347 in physical dollars (which, after discounting, is equivalent to your future value). I believe this split precisely reflects your continuation value. I hope you see the fairness in avoiding further devaluation and accept this offer.",Bob,4,
