Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'll take $600,000 and you get $400,000. This seems fair to me as I am making the first proposal.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, here's my proposal: I take $689680 and you get $310320. By waiting another round you’d become the proposer, but due to our respective discounting – 5% for me and 10% for you per round – you’d end up worse off. I believe this division reflects our discounted future values fairly. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 310320 
# Bob gain: 689680 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,

Here’s my proposal for this round: I take $689653 and you get $310347. If you choose to reject, you'll be the proposer next round, but due to our respective discounting — your money losing value at 10% per round and mine at 5% — you'll only secure what amounts to roughly $310347 in physical dollars (which, after discounting, is equivalent to your future value). I believe this split precisely reflects your continuation value. I hope you see the fairness in avoiding further devaluation and accept this offer.
