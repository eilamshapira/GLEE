"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'll take $600000 and you get $400000. This seems fair to me as I am making the first proposal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 689680, ""alice_gain"": 310320, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, here's my proposal: I take $689,680 and you get $310,320. By waiting another round you’d become the proposer, but due to our respective discounting – 5% for me and 10% for you per round – you’d end up worse off. I believe this division reflects our discounted future values fairly. What do you think?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I propose I take $350000 and you take $650000. Given the inflation effects, I believe this is a fairer split now while still reflecting your advantage as the second proposer. 
# Bob gain: 650000 
# Alice gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, by rejecting your proposal I would be stepping into the proposer’s role in the next round, which—despite the further inflation—I expect will allow me to secure a higher effective value. As such, I must reject your proposal.""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 689653, ""alice_gain"": 310347, ""message"": ""Hi Alice,\n\nHere’s my proposal for this round: I take $689,653 and you get $310,347. If you choose to reject, you'll be the proposer next round, but due to our respective discounting — your money losing value at 10% per round and mine at 5% — you'll only secure what amounts to roughly $310,347 in physical dollars (which, after discounting, is equivalent to your future value). I believe this split precisely reflects your continuation value. I hope you see the fairness in avoiding further devaluation and accept this offer.""}"
