"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My proposal is: Alice gets $6000, and Bob gets $4000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this. Bob is offering me $4500. Since it's round 2, my money is worth 20% less. So, $4500 * 0.8 = $3600 in round 1 dollars.

If I reject, I make the offer in round 3. In round 3, my money will be worth 40% less than in round 1.
I'll risk it and try to get a better deal.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to propose again. Remember, the money is now worth 40% less to me than in the first round, and Bob's money is worth 15% less. I need to factor this in.

I'll try to get a more favorable split, but also be realistic to avoid another rejection.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

My proposal is: Alice gets $5500, and Bob gets $4500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's break this down. Bob is offering me $4000. My money is now worth 48.8% less, so $4000 * (1 - 0.488) = $4000 * 0.512 = $2048 in round 1 dollars.

If I reject, I make the offer in round 5. My money will be worth significantly less. It's becoming very risky to reject offers.

Given the decreasing value of the money for me, I'm inclined to accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
