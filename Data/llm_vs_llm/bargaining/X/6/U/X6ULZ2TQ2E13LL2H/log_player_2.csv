"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

- Alice proposes I get $4,000 and she gets $6,000 out of $10,000
- If I reject and we go to the next round, the money loses 5% value for me
- In round 2, I'd be making an offer on $9,500 (worth to me)
- For Alice, the money loses 20% value per round, so next round would be worth only $8,000 to her

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer. If I reject now, I can propose a more favorable split in the next round where Alice will be under more pressure to accept due to her higher inflation rate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since Alice faces a much higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), she should be more eager to settle quickly. I'll propose a more balanced split that still gives me an advantage while being acceptable enough that Alice won't want to risk another round of high inflation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

- Alice proposes I get $4,500 and she gets $5,500 out of $10,000
- We're now in round 3, and my inflation is at 9.75% compared to round 1
- So this $4,500 is worth $4,500 Ã— (1-0.0975) = $4,061.25 to me in round 1 value
- If I reject, we go to round 4, where my inflation would be around 14.75%
- Alice's inflation is already at 36%, and would increase to ~49% next round
- If I make a counter-offer in round 4, she'd be under significant pressure due to her higher inflation

This offer is better than her first offer, but I believe I can still get a better deal in the next round given the asymmetric inflation rates.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that we're now in round 4, Alice's inflation penalty is much higher than mine. Her money is worth about 49% less than round 1, while mine is only worth about 14.75% less. This gives me significant leverage. I'll propose a split that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept given her high inflation penalty.
