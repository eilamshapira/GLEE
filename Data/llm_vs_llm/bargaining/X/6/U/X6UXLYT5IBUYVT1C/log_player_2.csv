"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer. She's proposing that out of the $10,000, I receive $4,000 and she gets $6,000.

If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-proposal in the next round, but the total amount will decrease by 20% to $8,000. That means even if I proposed a 50-50 split in the next round, I would get $4,000 - exactly what I'm being offered now.

Since I can't improve my position by rejecting (and might do worse if Alice rejects my next offer), it makes economic sense to accept this offer.
