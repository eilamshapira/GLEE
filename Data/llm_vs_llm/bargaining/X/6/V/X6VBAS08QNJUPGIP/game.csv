526316.0,473684.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a near‐fair division in line with an efficient agreement: I receive 526316$ and you 473684$. I’m keen to settle now since every delay devalues my share. Let’s avoid the inflation trap and agree promptly.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I'd like to propose a division that prioritizes my gain. I believe 600000 for me and 400000 for you is reasonable, given the devaluation that will occur if we continue to negotiate.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, your proposal gives me an effective 360000 in round‐1 dollars—a steep drop from the fair value I believe we can achieve. I'm concerned that waiting further only worsens my position through inflation, and I think my chances to secure a more balanced division as the next proposer are worth the risk. Let's continue the negotiation.",Alice,2,reject
142857.0,857143.0,"Hi Bob, as we move to round 3 the clock is ticking—my share is now worth only 80% of its face value, and I expect your share to drop to about 70% if we keep delaying. If you reject and wait until round 4, you'll be proposing in a period where your money is worth only about 60% of round‐1 value, meaning you could expect roughly 600000 in today’s terms. To match that, my offer gives you 857143 nominal dollars (857143 × 70% ≈ 600000 today). I’m offering you exactly what waiting would get you, while avoiding further unnecessary devaluation. I hope you’ll agree and we can close this deal now.",Alice,3,
