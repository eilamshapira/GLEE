"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 526316, ""bob_gain"": 473684, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a near‐fair division in line with an efficient agreement: I receive 526,316$ and you 473,684$. I’m keen to settle now since every delay devalues my share. Let’s avoid the inflation trap and agree promptly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I'd like to propose a division that prioritizes my gain. I believe 600000 for me and 400000 for you is reasonable, given the devaluation that will occur if we continue to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, your proposal gives me an effective 360,000 in round‐1 dollars—a steep drop from the fair value I believe we can achieve. I'm concerned that waiting further only worsens my position through inflation, and I think my chances to secure a more balanced division as the next proposer are worth the risk. Let's continue the negotiation.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 142857, ""bob_gain"": 857143, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, as we move to round 3 the clock is ticking—my share is now worth only 80% of its face value, and I expect your share to drop to about 70% if we keep delaying. If you reject and wait until round 4, you'll be proposing in a period where your money is worth only about 60% of round‐1 value, meaning you could expect roughly 600,000 in today’s terms. To match that, my offer gives you 857,143 nominal dollars (857,143 × 70% ≈ 600,000 today). I’m offering you exactly what waiting would get you, while avoiding further unnecessary devaluation. I hope you’ll agree and we can close this deal now.""}"
