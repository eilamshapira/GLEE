"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a near‐fair division in line with an efficient agreement: I receive 526316$ and you 473684$. I’m keen to settle now since every delay devalues my share. Let’s avoid the inflation trap and agree promptly. 
# Bob gain: 473684 
# Alice gain: 526316

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I'd like to propose a division that prioritizes my gain. I believe 600,000 for me and 400,000 for you is reasonable, given the devaluation that will occur if we continue to negotiate.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, as we move to round 3 the clock is ticking—my share is now worth only 80% of its face value, and I expect your share to drop to about 70% if we keep delaying. If you reject and wait until round 4, you'll be proposing in a period where your money is worth only about 60% of round‐1 value, meaning you could expect roughly 600000 in today’s terms. To match that, my offer gives you 857143 nominal dollars (857143 × 70% ≈ 600000 today). I’m offering you exactly what waiting would get you, while avoiding further unnecessary devaluation. I hope you’ll agree and we can close this deal now. 
# Bob gain: 857143 
# Alice gain: 142857
