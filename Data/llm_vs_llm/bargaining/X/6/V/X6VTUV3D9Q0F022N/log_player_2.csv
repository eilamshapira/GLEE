"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, the effective amount is $100 * 0.9 = $90. For Alice, it's $100 * 0.95 = $95. 

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the original $100 and split it in a way that seems reasonable, given that I've already rejected Alice's offer.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, the $45 I gain is worth 19% less, so it's effectively $45 * 0.81 = $36.45.

I'll think about whether this is a good deal for me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, and this is the 4th round, the effective amount for me is $100 * (0.9)^3 = $100 * 0.729 = $72.90. For Alice, it's $100 * (0.95)^3 = $100 * 0.857375 = $85.7375.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the original $100 and split it in a way that seems reasonable, given that we've already had a few rounds.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, the $48 I gain is worth 34.39% less, so it's effectively $48 * (1 - 0.3439) = $48 * 0.6561 = $31.49.

I'll think about whether this is a good deal for me, given the decreasing value of the money.
