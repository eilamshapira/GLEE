"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 28.57 
# Alice gain: 71.43 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
* Alice is offering me $28.57, keeping $71.43 for herself
* This is a rather uneven split (roughly 29-71)
* If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
* However, my money will be worth 20% less next round
* $28.57 now is better than $40 in the next round (which would be worth $32 after 20% inflation)

I should reject and propose a more balanced split, even accounting for the inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me make a strategic offer:
* I need to account for the fact that if Alice rejects, her money will be worth 10% less next round
* A fair split would be 50-50, but I need to incentivize her to accept now
* If she rejects, she can offer again, but the total value will be less for both of us

I'll propose a split that's slightly in her favor but much more balanced than her initial offer:

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}

This is a reasonable offer that gives her a small advantage while being much fairer than her initial proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 9.53 
# Alice gain: 90.47 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

* Alice is now offering me $9.53, but it's worth 36% less than round 1 value
* The actual value to me is only $9.53 * 0.64 = $6.10
* Alice's offer is even worse than her first offer
* If I reject and make a counter-offer, my money will be worth 48.8% less next round
* Even if I propose a 50-50 split next round, my $50 would be worth only $25.60 due to inflation

This is a very poor offer, but the severe inflation penalty means I'm losing negotiating power with each round. Still, this offer is so low that I should reject it and try one more time.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","The situation is getting critical due to inflation:
* My money is now worth 48.8% less than round 1
* Alice's money is worth 27.1% less than round 1
* If Alice rejects this offer, my next potential gain will be worth even less
* I need to make an offer that Alice will likely accept, while still getting something meaningful

I'll make an offer that strongly favors Alice but is still better than getting almost nothing:

{""bob_gain"": 35, ""alice_gain"": 65}

This gives Alice a clear advantage but is much more reasonable than her last offer. Given the inflation pressure on both of us (but especially on me), this should be attractive enough for her to accept."
