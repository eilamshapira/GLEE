"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
* She's offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
* This is a 40-60 split in her favor
* If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
* However, due to 20% inflation per round for me, my next round's money will be worth less
* $4,000 now is better than a larger nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation
* Still, I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic offer:
* I need to make it attractive enough for Alice to accept
* But also want to get a fair share
* Given that Alice faces 10% inflation per round vs my 20%
* A slightly better than 50-50 split might be acceptable to her
* If she rejects, her money will be worth less next round

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}

I propose this roughly 52-48 split which is more balanced than her initial offer while still giving me a slight advantage. This offer is more equitable than her initial 40-60 split, and given the inflation pressure, it should be appealing to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
* Alice is offering $4,500 (but worth 36% less due to inflation)
* Real value to me: $4,500 Ã— (1 - 0.36) = $2,880
* This is a 45-55 split nominally, better than her first offer
* If I reject:
  * Next round I'll face 48.8% inflation (1 - 0.8^4)
  * Any counter-offer would need to be significantly higher in nominal terms to be worth more
  * Alice's inflation is increasing more slowly
* The decreasing real value makes this offer more urgent to accept
