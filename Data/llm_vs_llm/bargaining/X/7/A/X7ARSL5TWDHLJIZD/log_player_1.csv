"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation loss.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since we're splitting the pot, let's be fair. I propose a 50/50 split. This is a win-win, and we both get a good start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response):
- The 50-50 split is fair and reasonable
- With inflation affecting my share by 5%, I would get equivalent of $4,750 in round 1 value
- Waiting longer means my share will keep decreasing by 5% each round
- Better to accept a fair deal now than risk getting less in future rounds or nothing if we can't agree
- Even though Bob's loss is higher (20%), that shouldn't affect my decision since I'm focused on maximizing my own outcome"
