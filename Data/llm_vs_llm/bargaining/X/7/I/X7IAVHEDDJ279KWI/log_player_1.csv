"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both lose value in future rounds, and you lose less than I do with each delay.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the decreasing value, I'm offering a more balanced split. It's in your best interest to accept, as the value will drop further for you in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
* If I accept now, I get $450,000 at 80% value = $360,000 effective value
* If I reject and propose in next round, any amount will be worth only 60% for me
* Even if I got $600,000 in next round, it would be worth $360,000 (60% of 600k)
* And Bob would likely reject such a proposal anyway since they have better options

Given that delaying further would significantly reduce my potential gains due to the higher inflation rate affecting me, and this is a reasonable offer...
