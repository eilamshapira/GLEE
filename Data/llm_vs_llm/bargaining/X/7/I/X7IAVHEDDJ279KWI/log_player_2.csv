"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both lose value in future rounds, and you lose less than I do with each delay. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into consideration.

The value of the money for me is now $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000.
The value of the money for Alice is now $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000.

Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Considering the decreasing value, I'm offering a more balanced split. It's in your best interest to accept, as the value will drop further for you in the next round.""}"
