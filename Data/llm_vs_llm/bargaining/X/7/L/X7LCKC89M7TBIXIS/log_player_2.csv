"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both get a good share. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is a fair 50-50 split
2. If I reject, the next round will have 10% inflation, meaning the $5000 would be worth $4500 to me
3. Even if I make a more favorable proposal next round, Alice might reject it
4. Getting $5000 right now is better than risking a lower value due to inflation
