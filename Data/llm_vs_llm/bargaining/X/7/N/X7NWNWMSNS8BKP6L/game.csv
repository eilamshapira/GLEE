0.0,1000000.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal: I’m offering you the entire $1000000. Since every round that passes causes a 5% loss in my money’s value while your money remains undiminished, if you decide to wait, you’re in the same position – in fact, you’d eventually be the proposer with a full dollar value, and I’d end up with nothing. Thus, accepting this offer ensures you get the full pie now. I hope you agree.",Alice,1,
