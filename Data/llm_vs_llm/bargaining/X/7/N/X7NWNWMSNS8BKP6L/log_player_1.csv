"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 1000000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my proposal: I’m offering you the entire $1,000,000. Since every round that passes causes a 5% loss in my money’s value while your money remains undiminished, if you decide to wait, you’re in the same position – in fact, you’d eventually be the proposer with a full dollar value, and I’d end up with nothing. Thus, accepting this offer ensures you get the full pie now. I hope you agree.""}"
