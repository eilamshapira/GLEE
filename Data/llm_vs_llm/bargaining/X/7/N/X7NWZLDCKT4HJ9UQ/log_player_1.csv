"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind that the money is worth less to me with each round.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm aiming for a significant portion upfront, acknowledging Bob's advantage of not facing inflation. I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob has offered me $450,000. Because of inflation, this is worth 5% less than if I had received it in round 1. So, effectively, it's worth $450,000 * 0.95 = $427,500 to me *now*.

In the previous round, I offered Bob $400,000, and kept $600,000 (worth $600,000 to me). However, Bob declined.

If I reject this offer, then in the next round, my offer will need to be even higher to account for the additional 5% inflation.
Let's calculate what happens if I reject.
The money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
