60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. Since inflation affects me by 20% each round, if we delay too long, we'll both lose value. This is a fair offer considering my inflation penalty.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is more fair considering I have a lower inflation rate. Let's settle this quickly to minimize the impact of inflation for both of us.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, thanks for sharing about your inflation rate. Given that my inflation is significantly higher at 20% compared to your 5%, I need a higher portion to offset this disadvantage. A 55-45 split in my favor is fair considering this difference. Let's agree and finish this before inflation erodes more value for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Alice, I understand your situation, but I also need to consider my own losses due to inflation. Let's meet in the middle with a 52-48 split in my favor. This way, we both get a fair share considering our respective inflation rates.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, my inflation rate (20% per round) is four times yours (5% per round). At this point, I've already lost nearly 50% of the value while you've only lost about 15%. Given this significant difference, a 52-48 split in my favor is actually more than fair. Let's agree on this and end the game before we both lose more value.",Alice,5,
