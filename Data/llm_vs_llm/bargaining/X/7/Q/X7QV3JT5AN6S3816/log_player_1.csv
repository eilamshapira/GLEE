"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. Since inflation affects me by 20% each round, if we delay too long, we'll both lose value. This is a fair offer considering my inflation penalty.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is more fair considering I have a lower inflation rate. Let's settle this quickly to minimize the impact of inflation for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for sharing about your inflation rate. Given that my inflation is significantly higher at 20% compared to your 5%, I need a higher portion to offset this disadvantage. A 55-45 split in my favor is fair considering this difference. Let's agree and finish this before inflation erodes more value for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your situation, but I also need to consider my own losses due to inflation. Let's meet in the middle with a 52-48 split in my favor. This way, we both get a fair share considering our respective inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, 
""bob_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, my inflation rate (20% per round) is four times yours (5% per round). At this point, I've already lost nearly 50% of the value while you've only lost about 15%. Given this significant difference, a 52-48 split in my favor is actually more than fair. Let's agree on this and end the game before we both lose more value.""}"
