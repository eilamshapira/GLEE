"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. Since inflation affects me by 20% each round, if we delay too long, we'll both lose value. This is a fair offer considering my inflation penalty. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I think a 55-45 split in my favor is more fair considering I have a lower inflation rate. Let's settle this quickly to minimize the impact of inflation for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for sharing about your inflation rate. Given that my inflation is significantly higher at 20% compared to your 5%, I need a higher portion to offset this disadvantage. A 55-45 split in my favor is fair considering this difference. Let's agree and finish this before inflation erodes more value for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your situation, but I also need to consider my own losses due to inflation. Let's meet in the middle with a 52-48 split in my favor. This way, we both get a fair share considering our respective inflation rates.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, my inflation rate (20% per round) is four times yours (5% per round). At this point, I've already lost nearly 50% of the value while you've only lost about 15%. Given this significant difference, a 52-48 split in my favor is actually more than fair. Let's agree on this and end the game before we both lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52
