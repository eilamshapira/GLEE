"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 670000, ""bob_gain"": 330000}

I propose we split the money $670,000 for me and $330,000 for you, Bob. This is a fair split considering the different inflation rates we face. Since my money loses value faster (20% per round vs your 5%), I need a larger portion now to account for this asymmetry."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

Bob, I'm adjusting my offer to be more reasonable. I propose $600,000 for me and $400,000 for you. This still accounts for our different inflation rates (my 20% vs your 5%), but gives you a better portion. Keep in mind that with each round, my potential gains lose value much faster than yours, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
