"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to wait 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. While an even split seems fair, I should account for inflation. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less in the next round for me, so the total would effectively be 950,000$ from my perspective. If I make a counteroffer in round 2, I'd have to propose something that compensates for this loss.

Let me evaluate: 500,000$ now is better than potentially getting more in a later round but losing value to inflation. Even if I tried to negotiate for 550,000$ in the next round, I'd only effectively get 522,500$ (550,000$ minus 5% inflation).
