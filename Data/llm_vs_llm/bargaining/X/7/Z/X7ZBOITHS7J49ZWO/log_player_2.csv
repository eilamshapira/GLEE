"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly. I'll take 600k, you get 400k. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I take $400,000 while she takes $600,000. This isn't an even split, and I need to factor in that my money loses 20% value each round, while Alice's doesn't lose any value.

If I reject now and make a counter-offer next round, my money will only be worth 80% of its current value. So even if I got more dollars in the next round, I need to consider if it would actually be worth more than $400,000 now.

This isn't a completely fair split, but given the inflation penalty I face, I should probably accept rather than risk a worse outcome through extended negotiation.
