5200.0,4800.0,I propose a slightly favorable split for me to account for the inflation.  Let's settle this quickly so we both benefit.,Alice,1,

3700.0,6300.0,"Alice, with each round delay your money loses 5% of its value, while none of my funds are affected. By accepting this round‐2 offer, you secure an effective $3515, which is likely better than what future rounds would yield. I believe this fair split reflects the current circumstances and saves us both further losses. Let's conclude this deal now for our mutual benefit.",Bob,2,

9500.0,500.0,"Alice, as we move further along the rounds, your money continues to lose value. If you wait until round 5 to propose, you’d command nearly the entire $10000, but at a discount (about 81.45% of its face value). In round 4 the effective value for you is 85.74% of the nominal amount. To be indifferent, you’d need roughly $9500 nominal now—that is, 9500 × 0.8574 ≈ $8145 in effective terms, which matches what you could secure in round 5. Given this, I propose that I take $500 and you receive $9500. Accepting now avoids further losses for you. Let's settle quickly and avoid additional devaluation.",Bob,4,
