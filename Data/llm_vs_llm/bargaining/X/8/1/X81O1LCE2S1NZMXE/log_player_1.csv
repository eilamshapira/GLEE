Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with each round delay your money loses 5% of its value, while none of my funds are affected. By accepting this round‐2 offer, you secure an effective $3515, which is likely better than what future rounds would yield. I believe this fair split reflects the current circumstances and saves us both further losses. Let's conclude this deal now for our mutual benefit. 
# Alice gain: 3700 
# Bob gain: 6300

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we move further along the rounds, your money continues to lose value. If you wait until round 5 to propose, you’d command nearly the entire $10000, but at a discount (about 81.45% of its face value). In round 4 the effective value for you is 85.74% of the nominal amount. To be indifferent, you’d need roughly $9500 nominal now—that is, 9500 × 0.8574 ≈ $8145 in effective terms, which matches what you could secure in round 5. Given this, I propose that I take $500 and you receive $9500. Accepting now avoids further losses for you. Let's settle quickly and avoid additional devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 9500 
# Bob gain: 500
