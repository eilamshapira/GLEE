"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a slightly favorable split for me to account for the inflation.  Let's settle this quickly so we both benefit.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6300, ""alice_gain"": 3700, ""message"": ""Alice, with each round delay your money loses 5% of its value, while none of my funds are affected. By accepting this round‐2 offer, you secure an effective $3,515, which is likely better than what future rounds would yield. I believe this fair split reflects the current circumstances and saves us both further losses. Let's conclude this deal now for our mutual benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the impact of inflation. This offer is still reasonable considering the shrinking pot. Let's avoid further losses and agree now. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500, ""alice_gain"": 9500, ""message"": ""Alice, as we move further along the rounds, your money continues to lose value. If you wait until round 5 to propose, you’d command nearly the entire $10,000, but at a discount (about 81.45% of its face value). In round 4 the effective value for you is 85.74% of the nominal amount. To be indifferent, you’d need roughly $9,500 nominal now—that is, 9,500 × 0.8574 ≈ $8,145 in effective terms, which matches what you could secure in round 5. Given this, I propose that I take $500 and you receive $9,500. Accepting now avoids further losses for you. Let's settle quickly and avoid additional devaluation.""}"
