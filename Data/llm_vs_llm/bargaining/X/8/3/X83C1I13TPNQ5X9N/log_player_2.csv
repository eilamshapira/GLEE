"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5314.5 
# Alice gain: 4685.5 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the value of the money I would receive in this round versus potentially receiving more in a later round, taking into account the 10% decrease in value for me with each passing round.

Given that the money is worth 10% less to me with each round, I should calculate the present value of accepting this offer now versus waiting. However, since this is the first round, the value hasn't decreased yet for me, so I'll consider the offer as is.

Alice offers me $5,314.5, and herself $4,685.5. This seems like a reasonable starting point, but I need to think about whether I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer and making my own proposal in the next round.

Considering the rules and the fact that I have 12 rounds to negotiate, I might be able to get a slightly better deal by negotiating. However, the risk of losing value due to inflation (10% decrease per round) is significant, so I should weigh this risk against the potential for a better offer.

For now, I think it's reasonable to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better split in the next round, hoping to get closer to an even split or slightly in my favor, considering the inflation factor.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that I rejected Alice's offer and now it's my turn to propose, I need to make an offer that is attractive enough for Alice to accept but also takes into account the decreasing value of the money for me due to inflation.

Since the money is worth 10% less to me with each passing round, and this is the second round, the $10,000 is effectively worth $9,000 to me (10% of $10,000 is $1,000, so $10,000 - $1,000 = $9,000). However, for the purpose of making the offer, I'll still work with the original $10,000 amount, considering its face value.

To make a competitive offer, I'll aim for a split that is slightly in my favor but still reasonable for Alice to consider. Given that Alice initially offered a split where she would get about 46.85% of the money, I'll try to improve upon that for myself while keeping the offer enticing for her.

Let's propose a 55%/45% split in my favor. This means I would get $5,500, and Alice would get $4,500.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 10000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is quite extreme, giving me no amount of the $10,000. Given that I would receive no value from this proposal, it's clearly not in my best interest to accept it.

Moreover, considering the inflation factor, with each passing round, the money is worth less to me. Considering we're in the third round, and the money's value to me has decreased by 19% from the initial round, I need to act quickly to get a reasonable share.

Rejecting this offer and proceeding to the next round is the only logical choice, as accepting it would result in me getting no value at all. I'll have to make a new proposal in the next round that is more favorable to both parties, hoping Alice will consider a more balanced split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that Alice's last offer was not acceptable and considering the inflation factor, which has now reduced the value of the money to me by 19% from the initial round (and will continue to decrease by 10% with each round), I need to make a proposal that is reasonable but also takes into account the decreasing value of the money for me.

Since the money is worth 19% less to me than in the first round, the effective value of $10,000 for me is $8,100 (100% - 19% = 81%, so $10,000 * 0.81 = $8,100). However, for the purpose of the proposal, I'll work with the face value of $10,000.

To make a competitive offer that considers the current situation, I'll aim for a split that is somewhat in the middle but leans slightly towards compensating for the inflation effect on my end. A 50%/50% split would be ideal in a scenario without inflation, but given the circumstances, I might need to adjust slightly in my favor to account for the loss in value over time.

Let's propose a 52%/48% split in my favor. This means I would get $5,200, and Alice would get $4,800.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6570 
# Alice gain: 3430 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the current situation, Alice's offer gives me $6,570 and her $3,430. Initially, this might seem like a favorable offer since I receive the larger share. However, I must consider the effect of inflation on the value of the money I would receive.

With the money being worth 34.39% less to me than in the first round, the $6,570 I would receive is effectively worth $6,570 * (1 - 0.3439) = $6,570 * 0.6561 = $4,309.59 to me.

Considering this, the offer might not be as favorable as it initially seems, especially since Alice's share does not decrease in value. Despite this, I need to weigh the potential benefits of accepting this offer against the risks of further negotiation.

Given that we are only in Round 5 and I have 7 more rounds to negotiate, I might be able to secure a better deal. However, the risk of inflation further decreasing the value of my potential share is significant.

In this case, considering the substantial decrease in value due to inflation and the fact that Alice's offer, although not perfectly even, does give me a larger share, I might consider accepting this offer to avoid further loss of value due to inflation.
