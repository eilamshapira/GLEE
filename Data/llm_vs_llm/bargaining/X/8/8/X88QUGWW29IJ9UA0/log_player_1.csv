"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. My original offer was rejected, and now Bob is making an offer. I also need to factor in the 5% inflation on my share.

Before I make my decision, let's calculate the effective value of the $5000 Bob is offering me, considering the inflation.

Since I started with $10,000, and now it's round 2, my money is worth 5% less.

Effective value of $5000 = $5000 * (1 - 0.05) = $5000 * 0.95 = $4750

Considering I started with $10000 and I would get only $4750 in the end, I will reject the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, time for my offer in Round 3.  I need to account for *another* 5% inflation, making the money less valuable for me.

The initial $10,000 has now depreciated by 5% twice. That means for every dollar I receive, the equivalent value is now: 1 * (1 - 0.05) * (1 - 0.05) = 1 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
