Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but I think I deserve a bit more for going first.  How about a 65/35 split?""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle with a 60/40 split? Itâ€™s closer to what you wanted, and still fair for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Taking into account the inflation, this is a good offer for me. It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting even less later."
