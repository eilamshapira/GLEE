"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 482622 
# Alice gain: 517378 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer.

She's offering me $482,622 and keeping $517,378 for herself. This is a slight advantage for her, but not by a huge margin. It's close to a 48/52 split.

If I reject, we move to round 2, but the total money decreases by 20% to $800,000. This means even if I proposed a 50/50 split in the next round, I would get $400,000, which is less than what Alice is offering me now.

Given that I would lose value by rejecting and negotiating further, this seems like a reasonable offer.
