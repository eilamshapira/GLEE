60.0,40.0,Let's split this fairly - I'm offering you $40 considering the 5% inflation risk I face if we delay.,Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Since you face 5% inflation per round and I don't, this split is actually fair. If you reject, your $45 will be worth only $42.75 next round, while my portion keeps its value.",Bob,2,
