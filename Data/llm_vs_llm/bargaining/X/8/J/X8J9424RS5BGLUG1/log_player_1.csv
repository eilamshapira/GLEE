"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's split this fairly - I'm offering you $40 considering the 5% inflation risk I face if we delay.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you face 5% inflation per round and I don't, this split is actually fair. If you reject, your $45 will be worth only $42.75 next round, while my portion keeps its value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $45 (at 5% inflation = $42.75 real value)
- If I reject and propose next round:
  - My portion will face another 5% inflation (total 10% less value)
  - Even if I propose a more favorable split, Bob might reject again
  - The risk of further devaluation makes accepting now more attractive
- Bob's reasoning about inflation is correct
