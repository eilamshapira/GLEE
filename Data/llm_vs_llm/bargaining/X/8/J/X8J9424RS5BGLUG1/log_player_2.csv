"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly - I'm offering you $40 considering the 5% inflation risk I face if we delay. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $40, keeping $60 for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. Due to inflation:
   - My money value stays the same (0% inflation)
   - Alice's money loses 5% value each round
4. This gives me negotiating leverage, as delaying hurts Alice more than me
5. I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and proposing a more favorable split next round

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice faces 5% inflation per round while I don't, I have some leverage. However, I should still be reasonable to increase chances of acceptance.

""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Since you face 5% inflation per round and I don't, this split is actually fair. If you reject, your $45 will be worth only $42.75 next round, while my portion keeps its value.""}"
