"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""My turn, let's make it more even!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's find a compromise. How about this? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, I'll get $400,000, which is worth 81% of the original value (1 - 0.19 = 0.81). So, the effective value for me would be $400,000 * 0.81 = $324,000.

If I reject, the next round will have even more inflation.
