"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my offer for Round 1.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose that I get $55 and you get $45. This is a fair split that gives us both a substantial amount, with a slight advantage to me as the first mover. If we delay, we both lose value due to inflation, so accepting now maximizes our total gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose that I get $60 and you get $40. Since we're now in round 3, inflation is affecting both of us - my share is worth less due to the 20% inflation per round, and yours is worth less due to the 10% inflation per round. This split acknowledges our different inflation rates while still providing you with a substantial portion. Let's reach an agreement before inflation reduces the value further for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
