"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation. The money I receive is worth less now due to inflation.

Given the offer from Bob:

*   Alice gain: 50 (but worth less due to inflation)
*   Bob gain: 50

I will **reject** this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's round 3. The money I receive continues to lose value.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Inflation has further devalued my potential earnings.

Considering Bob's offer:

*   Alice gain: 45 (worth less due to inflation)
*   Bob gain: 55

I have to evaluate whether 45 (minus the inflation penalty) is better than the possibility of getting nothing. While the offer is not ideal, I will **accept** this offer.
