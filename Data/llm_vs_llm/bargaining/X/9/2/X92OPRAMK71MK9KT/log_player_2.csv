"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm suggesting a slight adjustment to the split that still gives Alice a substantial portion. Since she faces a 10% devaluation per round, it makes sense for us to reach an agreement earlier rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 58 
# Alice gain: 42 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
