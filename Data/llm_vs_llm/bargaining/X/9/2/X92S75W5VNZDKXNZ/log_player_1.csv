"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a fair split where I get $5,500 and you get $4,500. With the 5% inflation affecting me each round, waiting would hurt my position. This is a reasonable offer that gives both of us a substantial amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose an even split where we each get $5000. This ensures fairness for both of us, and although inflation affects us differently, this division leaves us with equal halves of the original amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
