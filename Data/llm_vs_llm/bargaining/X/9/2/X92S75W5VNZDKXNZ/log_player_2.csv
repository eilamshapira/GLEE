"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a fair split where I get $5500 and you get $4500. With the 5% inflation affecting me each round, waiting would hurt my position. This is a reasonable offer that gives both of us a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I propose an even split where we each get $5000. This ensures fairness for both of us, and although inflation affects us differently, this division leaves us with equal halves of the original amount.""}"
