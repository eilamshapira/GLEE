550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a substantial 45% of the total amount. This is fair given that I face a 5% depreciation penalty each round while you don't. If we continue negotiating, the total value decreases for me, making this an optimal solution for both of us right now.",Alice,1,

1.0,999999.0,"Alice, note that every further round slices 5% off your money, while my share remains fully intact. If you reject now, you'll get a chance to propose in round 3—but then I can force nearly the entire amount for myself, leaving you with almost nothing. Accepting this offer now guarantees you something rather than a near‐zero outcome later. Please accept.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, your attempt at intimidation won't work. Your extreme offer shows you're not negotiating in good faith. Here's a reasonable offer of 60/40 that acknowledges my 5% penalty but remains fair to both of us. If you reject this, I can similarly reject your next extreme offer, and we'll keep going. Let's be reasonable and settle now with a fair split that benefits us both rather than dragging this out.",Alice,3,

950000.0,50000.0,"Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in round 5—but the depreciation will worsen your effective returns (your money will be worth only about 81.45% of its nominal value then). With my offer in round 4, you secure 950000 nominal dollars, which at the current discount factor (85.74%) gives you roughly 814506 in real value—exactly what you'd expect if you waited. To avoid further loss from inflation, please accept this proposal.",Bob,4,
