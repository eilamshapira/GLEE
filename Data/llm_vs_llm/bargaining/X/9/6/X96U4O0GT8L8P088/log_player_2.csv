"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a substantial 45% of the total amount. This is fair given that I face a 5% depreciation penalty each round while you don't. If we continue negotiating, the total value decreases for me, making this an optimal solution for both of us right now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 999999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, note that every further round slices 5% off your money, while my share remains fully intact. If you reject now, you'll get a chance to propose in round 3—but then I can force nearly the entire amount for myself, leaving you with almost nothing. Accepting this offer now guarantees you something rather than a near‐zero outcome later. Please accept.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your attempt at intimidation won't work. Your extreme offer shows you're not negotiating in good faith. Here's a reasonable offer of 60/40 that acknowledges my 5% penalty but remains fair to both of us. If you reject this, I can similarly reject your next extreme offer, and we'll keep going. Let's be reasonable and settle now with a fair split that benefits us both rather than dragging this out. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50000, ""alice_gain"": 950000, ""message"": ""Alice, if you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer in round 5—but the depreciation will worsen your effective returns (your money will be worth only about 81.45% of its nominal value then). With my offer in round 4, you secure 950,000 nominal dollars, which at the current discount factor (85.74%) gives you roughly 814,506 in real value—exactly what you'd expect if you waited. To avoid further loss from inflation, please accept this proposal.""}"
