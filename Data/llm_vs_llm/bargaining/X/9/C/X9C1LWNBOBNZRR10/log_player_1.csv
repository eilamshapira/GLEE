"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that I'm taking on more risk as the first proposer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Position:**  A 60/40 split in Alice's favor establishes a strong initial position. 
* **Acknowledging Risk:** The message subtly hints that Bob benefits from a guaranteed amount upfront, while Alice's potential gains decrease with each round due to inflation. 
* **Open for Negotiation:**  The tone is reasonable and suggests a willingness to negotiate, which might encourage Bob to engage rather than immediately reject. 

It's important to balance assertiveness with a willingness to compromise to reach a mutually agreeable outcome. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn now, let's make it a bit more even, shall we? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is worse for Alice than her initial proposal in round 1, even considering the inflation. Accepting this would mean Alice loses out significantly compared to her starting point. While time (and value) is slipping away, it's worth pushing for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Time is money, Bob, and it's disappearing quickly for both of us. I'm proposing a split that's more in line with my initial offer, considering the lost value."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reflecting Time Pressure:** Alice's message directly addresses the increasing pressure from inflation and the diminishing value of the reward.
* **Asserting Value:**  By sticking close to her original 60/40 split proposal (adjusted for one round of inflation), Alice reasserts that her initial offer was fair.
* **Urging Agreement:**  The message emphasizes the shared risk of walking away with nothing if they can't agree.

This approach aims to nudge Bob towards a more agreeable middle ground by highlighting the urgency of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, inflation is eating away at our potential earnings, time to be reasonable 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, several factors now make it a reasonable choice for Alice to accept:

* **Significant Inflation:** Alice has now experienced two rounds of inflation, meaning her potential earnings have decreased by 27.1%. Accepting $5,000 now is better than risking further losses.
* **Bob's Stance:**  Bob has consistently aimed for a larger share. It's unlikely he'll agree to anything significantly better than a 50/50 split without further significant concessions from Alice.
* **Time Pressure:** With eight rounds remaining, there's still a risk of reaching an impasse and receiving nothing. 

Accepting now secures a reasonable payout for Alice and avoids the risk of complete loss as time runs out."
