"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split this fairly. I propose 60 for me and 40 for you. Let's grab this deal before inflation eats away at our gains! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With a 60-40 split, I would get $40. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me, meaning the maximum I could get would effectively be worth $90 (100% - 10% = 90% of the original value).

While a 50-50 split might seem more ""fair"", getting $40 right now is still a decent offer, and the risk of losing value through inflation makes accepting this offer a reasonable choice. Additionally, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to even more rounds and more value lost to inflation.
