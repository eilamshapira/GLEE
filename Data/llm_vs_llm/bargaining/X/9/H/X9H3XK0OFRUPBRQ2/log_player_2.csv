"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I'll take 55, you get 45. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully, taking into account the 10% inflation penalty for each round if I reject.

If I accept now, I get $45.
If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value to me would be worth 10% less, so the $100 would effectively be worth $90 to me. Even if I could get a larger share in the next round, I need to factor in this depreciation.

While Alice's offer isn't an even 50-50 split, getting $45 now is reasonable considering the inflation penalty for waiting.
