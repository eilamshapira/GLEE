800000.0,200000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose I get 800k and you get 200k. Given the 20% inflation penalty per round for you, this is actually a good deal - if you reject, your next share will effectively be worth 20% less.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation impact on my share, I propose a split of 600k for you and 400k for me. This offer is fair given the circumstances and still generous towards you.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
850000.0,150000.0,"Bob, let's be rational. Due to the two rounds of inflation, if you reject this offer, your next proposal will be worth even less to you. This 150k now is worth more than a larger number in the next round. I suggest we conclude this now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Alice, with the inflation effect now at 48.8% for me, I'm proposing 700k for you and 300k for me. This is still a significant amount for you, and it's a fair compromise considering my diminishing returns. Let's end this on a reasonable note.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
900000.0,100000.0,"Bob, the inflation has reduced your purchasing power by nearly 50% already. If you reject this offer, the next round will make your share worth even less. This 100k now is worth more to you than a larger number next round. Let's conclude this now with a deal that makes economic sense given the circumstances.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Alice, we're now at a point where my share is worth 67.24% less due to inflation. I'm offering 800k for you and 200k for me. This is a fair deal considering the significant impact of inflation on my side. Let's settle this before it gets worse.",Bob,6,
