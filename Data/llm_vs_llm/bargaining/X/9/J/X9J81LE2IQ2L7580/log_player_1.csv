"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose I get 800k and you get 200k. Given the 20% inflation penalty per round for you, this is actually a good deal - if you reject, your next share will effectively be worth 20% less.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation impact on my share, I propose a split of 600k for you and 400k for me. This offer is fair given the circumstances and still generous towards you. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The rational choice is to reject. Since Bob faces 20% inflation per round and I don't, I can make a better offer in the next round that he'll be more likely to accept, as his future purchasing power continues to decrease. Going back to my original offer or something close to it would be more advantageous for me."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be rational. Due to the two rounds of inflation, if you reject this offer, your next proposal will be worth even less to you. This 150k now is worth more than a larger number in the next round. I suggest we conclude this now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with the inflation effect now at 48.8% for me, I'm proposing 700k for you and 300k for me. This is still a significant amount for you, and it's a fair compromise considering my diminishing returns. Let's end this on a reasonable note. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Given that Bob's purchasing power continues to decrease significantly (now at 48.8% less), while mine remains unchanged, I can still achieve a better outcome by rejecting. In the next round, Bob's position will be even weaker due to further inflation, making him more likely to accept a more favorable offer for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Bob, the inflation has reduced your purchasing power by nearly 50% already. If you reject this offer, the next round will make your share worth even less. This 100k now is worth more to you than a larger number next round. Let's conclude this now with a deal that makes economic sense given the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're now at a point where my share is worth 67.24% less due to inflation. I'm offering 800k for you and 200k for me. This is a fair deal considering the significant impact of inflation on my side. Let's settle this before it gets worse. 
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While I could theoretically continue to push for more, Bob is now offering me 800k which matches my initial proposal. Given that we've gone through several rounds and this is a very favorable split for me (80-20), it's reasonable to conclude the negotiation here. The marginal gain from continuing further rounds might not be worth the risk of potential unexpected outcomes."
