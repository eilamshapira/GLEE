"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose I get 800k and you get 200k. Given the 20% inflation penalty per round for you, this is actually a good deal - if you reject, your next share will effectively be worth 20% less. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation impact on my share, I propose a split of 600k for you and 400k for me. This offer is fair given the circumstances and still generous towards you.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be rational. Due to the two rounds of inflation, if you reject this offer, your next proposal will be worth even less to you. This 150k now is worth more than a larger number in the next round. I suggest we conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, with the inflation effect now at 48.8% for me, I'm proposing 700k for you and 300k for me. This is still a significant amount for you, and it's a fair compromise considering my diminishing returns. Let's end this on a reasonable note.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the inflation has reduced your purchasing power by nearly 50% already. If you reject this offer, the next round will make your share worth even less. This 100k now is worth more to you than a larger number next round. Let's conclude this now with a deal that makes economic sense given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000

  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, we're now at a point where my share is worth 67.24% less due to inflation. I'm offering 800k for you and 200k for me. This is a fair deal considering the significant impact of inflation on my side. Let's settle this before it gets worse.""
