"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob.

Given that I'm facing inflation with each passing round, I should make a reasonable offer that Bob might accept right away.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives Bob a substantial portion while allowing me to protect against the inflation risk I'm facing in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer gives me only 45% of the total, and with the 10% inflation I'm experiencing, that's effectively worth even less to me. I believe I can make a counter-offer that's more favorable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll adjust my strategy considering we're now in round 3 and the inflation effect on my gains.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is more balanced than my initial offer while still accounting for my inflation disadvantage. Since Bob seems to value a higher share for himself based on his previous offer, I'm compromising while ensuring I get enough to offset some of the inflation effects."
