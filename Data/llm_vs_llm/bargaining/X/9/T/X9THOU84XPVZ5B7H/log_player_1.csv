"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering the 5% inflation penalty per round if rejected.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because while I want a fair portion, I also want to avoid multiple rounds of negotiation due to the inflation penalty. A 55-45 split is advantageous to me but not so unfair that Bob would definitely reject it. It's a balanced opening offer that shows I'm willing to give Bob a substantial portion while maintaining a slight advantage for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which is fair on the surface
2. Due to inflation, my $5000 is worth 5% less than in round 1 (effectively $4750)
3. I know Bob's portion is worth 20% less to him
4. If I reject and we continue, my next offer will be worth even less due to inflation
5. This is still a good offer considering the inflation penalty, and a better outcome than risking further rounds
