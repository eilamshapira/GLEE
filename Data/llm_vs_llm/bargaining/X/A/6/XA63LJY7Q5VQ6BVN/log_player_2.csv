"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given that I face higher inflation at 20% vs your 10%, I propose a 55-45 split which fairly compensates for this difference while still giving us both a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer. Alice proposes a 55-45 split, meaning I get $450,000. While I would prefer more, this is the first round and there are 11 rounds left. However, the money depreciates by 10% each round. If I reject and try to get more later, the total pie shrinks for me.

In this round, $450,000 is a reasonable starting point. Rejecting means risking a lower amount later due to the depreciation.
