"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. I'll try to be fair while keeping in mind the inflation effect on my end.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, with each of us receiving $500,000. This is a fair division that gives us equal amounts."
