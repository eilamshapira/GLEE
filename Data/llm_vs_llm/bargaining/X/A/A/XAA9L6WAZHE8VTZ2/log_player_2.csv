Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

I'll try to nudge Alice towards a more equitable split. Each round that passes diminishes the value of the reward for her, so hopefully, she'll be more amenable to a 50/50 split as time goes on."

It's not a perfect split, but with inflation working against Alice, it's better to take a reasonable offer now than risk getting a worse deal later."
