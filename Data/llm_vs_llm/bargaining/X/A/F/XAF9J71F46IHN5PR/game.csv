100.0,0.0,"Hi Bob, hereâ€™s my proposal for Round 1: I keep the entire $100 and you get $0. Given that each passing round devalues your share by 20% while mine remains undiminished, delaying only hurts you. I believe it's in your best interest to accept this offer without further delay.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, I understand the inflation affects me, but your offer of $0 was completely unfair. This 60/40 split in my favor compensates me for the 20% disadvantage I'll face if we need another round. This is much more reasonable than your initial proposal, and we can both walk away with a substantial amount.",Bob,2,
