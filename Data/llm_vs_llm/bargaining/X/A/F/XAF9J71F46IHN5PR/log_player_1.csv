"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 100, ""bob_gain"": 0, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, hereâ€™s my proposal for Round 1: I keep the entire $100 and you get $0. Given that each passing round devalues your share by 20% while mine remains undiminished, delaying only hurts you. I believe it's in your best interest to accept this offer without further delay.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation affects me, but your offer of $0 was completely unfair. This 60/40 split in my favor compensates me for the 20% disadvantage I'll face if we need another round. This is much more reasonable than your initial proposal, and we can both walk away with a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
