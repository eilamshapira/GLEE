"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, hereâ€™s my proposal for Round 1: I keep the entire $100 and you get $0. Given that each passing round devalues your share by 20% while mine remains undiminished, delaying only hurts you. I believe it's in your best interest to accept this offer without further delay. 
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is correct that delaying hurts me more than her, but her offer gives me nothing at all, which isn't reasonable. The optimal strategy is for me to reject this extremely unfair offer and make a counter-proposal that accounts for the inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the inflation affects me, but your offer of $0 was completely unfair. This 60/40 split in my favor compensates me for the 20% disadvantage I'll face if we need another round. This is much more reasonable than your initial proposal, and we can both walk away with a substantial amount.""}"
