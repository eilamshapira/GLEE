"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money with me getting $550,000 and you getting $450,000. This gives you a solid amount while reflecting that I'm making the first offer. If we negotiate too long, we'll both lose money to inflation, so let's try to reach an agreement quickly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. This way, neither of us is shortchanged, and we can avoid further inflation losses. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
