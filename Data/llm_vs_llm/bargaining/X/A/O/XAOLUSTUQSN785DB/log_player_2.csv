"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money with me getting $550000 and you getting $450000. This gives you a solid amount while reflecting that I'm making the first offer. If we negotiate too long, we'll both lose money to inflation, so let's try to reach an agreement quickly. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
