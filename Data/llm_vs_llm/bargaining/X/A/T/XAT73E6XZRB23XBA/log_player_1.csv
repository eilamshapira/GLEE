"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the different inflation penalties we face. Since I (Alice) face a higher inflation penalty than Bob (10% vs 5%), I should propose a division that's favorable to me but still attractive enough for Bob to accept, rather than continuing to the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer considering the inflation penalty. If I reject and proceed to round 3, the money will be worth another 10% less to me and 5% less to Bob.

If I accept Bob's offer now:
- I get $350,000 at 90% of original value = $315,000 equivalent value

If I reject and make a better offer in round 3, I'd face a 20% total inflation penalty. Even if I proposed a 50-50 split ($500,000 each), my share would be worth $500,000 Ã— 80% = $400,000.

However, Bob would likely reject that too, causing further rounds with increasing inflation penalties. Given the asymmetric inflation rates, delaying further rounds puts me at a disadvantage.
