"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer considering the given information.

Alice is proposing an even split of the $10,000, where each of us gets $5,000. This is a perfectly fair division.

The instructions mention that inflation doesn't affect me (0% inflation for me), so there's no disadvantage in accepting this offer versus continuing to the next round.

Given that this is a fair 50-50 split and there's no strategic advantage in waiting (for me), I'll accept this offer.
