"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. The money will be worth 5% less next round (4750$ value for my 5000$)
4. Alice might reject my next offer, leading to further inflation
5. This is a very reasonable first offer

Given that it's a fair split and the risk of value loss due to inflation, I'll accept.
