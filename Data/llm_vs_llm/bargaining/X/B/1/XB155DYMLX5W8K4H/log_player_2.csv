"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this quickly before inflation hits 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. While not an equal split, it's a substantial amount
3. She makes a valid point about inflation - if we keep rejecting, we'll lose 10% each round
4. By rejecting, I could propose next, but Alice might reject and we'd already lose 10%
5. The offer is reasonable enough that the risk of further negotiation may not be worth it
