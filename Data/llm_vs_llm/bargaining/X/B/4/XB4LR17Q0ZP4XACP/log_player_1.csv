Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both an equal share and avoids further inflation reducing our total. Let's reach an agreement quickly to maximize what we both receive. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
