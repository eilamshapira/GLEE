"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this quickly before inflation kicks in 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully.

Alice is offering a 60-40 split in her favor, which would give me $400,000 and her $600,000. While this isn't a 50-50 split, it's not terribly unfair.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the total money will be worth 5% less (so $950,000 total). I would need to consider what's reasonable and what Alice might accept.

Given that we have inflation reducing the value each round, and that a 60-40 split still gives me a substantial amount, I'll reject this to propose a more even split.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while acknowledging the inflation factor.
