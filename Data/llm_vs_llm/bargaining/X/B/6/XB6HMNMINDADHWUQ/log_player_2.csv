"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $4,000 out of the $10,000, which is 40% of the total amount. If I reject, we move to Round 2 where I can make a counter-offer, but due to inflation, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning the $10,000 would effectively be worth $8,000 to me.

If I accept now, I get $4,000 immediately. If I reject and propose a better split next round, even if I got 100% of the money, it would be worth at most $8,000 to me, and realistically Alice wouldn't accept such an extreme offer.
