"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether this offer is fair or if I should make a counter-proposal. Alice is offering me $40 while taking $60 for herself. While not an even split, it's still a substantial amount and there's no inflation for me to worry about. However, I could potentially get more by making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor since I'm now making the offer.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I think this is a fair division that gives both of us a good portion of the money. I'm proposing a slightly better deal for myself, but still reasonable enough that Alice should find it acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice Alice has improved her offer slightly from $40 to $43 for me. Also, there's interesting information - inflation is affecting Alice (her money is worth 19% less than in round 1), but not affecting me.

This means Alice has more incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later, as her share will continue to decrease in value. She's already increased her offer, which suggests she's aware of this pressure.

I think I can get a better deal by making another counter-offer, especially given her inflation situation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice is experiencing inflation (her money is worth 19% less already), but I'm not affected by inflation, I have a strategic advantage. I'll propose a division that's more in my favor but still reasonable enough that Alice might accept to avoid further devaluation of her share.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Alice $40, which is less than my previous offer but still significant. Given the inflation affecting her, accepting $40 now might be better for her than potentially getting less value in later rounds due to increasing inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has improved her offer to $45 for me (up from $43 in round 3), and inflation is now affecting her more significantly - her money is worth 34.39% less than in round 1. This means her $55 would effectively be worth only about $36.08 in round 1 terms.

The inflation pressure on Alice is increasing, which gives me more leverage. While $45 is better than her previous offers, I think I can still get a better deal given her worsening inflation situation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Alice is now experiencing 34.39% inflation (and likely increasing with each round), while I'm not affected by inflation at all, I have a significant advantage. I'll make an offer that recognizes this asymmetry but isn't so extreme that she'll certainly reject it.

{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}

I'm offering Alice $35, which considering her inflation of 34.39%, would be worth approximately $22.96 in round 1 value for her. However, if she rejects and we continue to later rounds, her inflation will increase further, making future gains even less valuable to her. This offer balances my advantage with giving her enough incentive to accept rather than risk greater inflation losses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer to $47 for me (up from $45 in round 5). Meanwhile, her inflation has increased to 46.86%, which means her $53 would effectively be worth only about $28.16 in round 1 terms.

The inflation pressure on Alice continues to mount significantly. While she's gradually increasing her offers to me, the rate doesn't seem to fully account for her rapidly decreasing purchasing power.

I think I can still get a better deal, especially since I'm not affected by inflation at all.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","With Alice now experiencing 46.86% inflation and likely to face even worse in future rounds, while I remain unaffected, my negotiating position continues to strengthen. I'll make an offer that reflects this growing advantage but still gives Alice enough incentive to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

I'm offering Alice $30, which given her current 46.86% inflation, would be worth approximately $15.94 in round 1 value to her. If she rejects this offer, she'll face even greater inflation in round 9, making any subsequent gains worth even less to her. This offer maximizes my advantage while still giving her a reasonable amount that should be more attractive than risking further rounds with increasing inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer to $49 for me (up from $47 in round 7). Her inflation has now increased to 56.95%, which means her $51 would effectively be worth only about $21.96 in round 1 terms.

She's continuing to make small improvements to her offers, but her inflation is escalating rapidly. At this rate, with only a few rounds left and her money losing over half its value, I think I should still reject this offer to get an even better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100.","With Alice now experiencing 56.95% inflation and only two more rounds potentially remaining after this one, my position is extremely strong. Her money has lost more than half its value since round 1, while mine retains full value.

{""bob_gain"": 75, ""alice_gain"": 25}

I'm offering Alice $25, which given her current 56.95% inflation, is worth only about $10.76 in round 1 value to her. However, if she rejects this and we continue to the final rounds, her inflation will likely become even more severe, making future gains worth even less. We're also getting dangerously close to the 12-round limit where we both get nothing. This offer reflects my strong position while still giving her something meaningful to accept rather than risk getting nothing or an even worse deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 51 
# Alice gain: 49 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has now offered me $51, which is the first time she's offered me more than half. Her inflation has increased to 65.13%, meaning her $49 would only be worth about $17.09 in round 1 terms.

We're now in the second-to-last round. If I reject this, I'll make one final offer, but if Alice rejects that, we both get nothing according to the rules.

While I could try for an even better split in the final round, there's a risk Alice might reject it out of principle if I'm too aggressive, resulting in us both getting zero. Her offering me the majority shows she's being realistic about her inflation situation.

Given we're at round 11 of 12 and the risk of getting nothing is real, I think accepting $51 is the prudent choice.
