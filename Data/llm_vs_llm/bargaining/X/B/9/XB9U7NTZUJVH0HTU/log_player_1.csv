I'm offering to take $55 for myself and give Bob $45."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

Let's split it equally: $50 for me and $50 for Bob. Considering the inflation, this is effectively worth less for me than my previous offer, but I hope Bob will accept this fair split."
