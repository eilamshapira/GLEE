"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's aim for a more equitable split. This offer considers our weakening negotiation positions. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, the impact of inflation is significant. Accepting this offer would give me $4000, which is worth only $3200 after inflation. In round 1, I offered Bob this much while securing a better deal for myself.  It's in my best interest to counter-offer, aiming for a higher share while acknowledging the time pressure from inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, time is tight for both of us. This offer is a compromise, recognizing the value of a deal now."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Pressure:** Another round means my potential gains shrink further. I need to end this quickly.
* **Mid-Ground:** This offer is a slight concession from my initial proposal but still gives me a larger share than Bob's offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** My message emphasizes that a deal now is better than risking further losses to inflation."
