"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Based on backward‐induction reasoning—and assuming fully rational, time‐discounting players—the unique subgame perfect equilibrium is that the patient side (Bob) eventually ends up with nearly all the value. In our game, Bob’s money is never discounted, while the value of dollars for me (Alice) is reduced by 10% every round. In round 2 (if you reject today) Bob would get to propose a deal in which he could claim almost all of the $100 (giving me only a token amount barely worth anything when discounted by 0.9). Thus, when I make the first proposal, Bob’s “outside option” (what he’d get by rejecting) is essentially $100. To have him accept immediately, I must offer him at least what he would get later. (Any offer less than $100 would be beaten by his waiting, and even an offer exactly equal to $100 leaves me nothing.)

So, my round‑1 offer is to leave Bob the entire $100—even though that is not exactly what I’d “like,” it is the only division that Bob will accept immediately rather than risk waiting (and then, eventually, claiming almost everything).

Here is my JSON offer:

{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 100}"
