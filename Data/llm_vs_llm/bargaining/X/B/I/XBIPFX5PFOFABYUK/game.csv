60.0,40.0,Let's split it 60/40. I believe this is a fair offer to start.,Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer. However, with time working against us on my end, I propose we settle quickly to avoid any further loss. I offer $55 for me and $45 for you, which I believe is a fair compromise that benefits both of us right away. What do you think?",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand your perspective, but that offer wasn't quite fair considering the time pressure. How about we meet in the middle at 55/45? It's a reasonable deal for both of us.",Alice,3,

52.0,48.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about fairness under the time pressure. However, please consider that every extra round costs you—your portion loses nearly 9.75% of its first‐round value each round. In round 3 your offer would give you 55 nominal dollars (roughly 49.64 in round‑1 value), but if we delay further, your gain will only shrink more. To avoid compounding these losses, I propose a quick settlement: I'll take $48 and you get $52. This deal may look a bit different nominally, but it locks in your share before further devaluation hits. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us under the current circumstances. What do you say?",Bob,4,
