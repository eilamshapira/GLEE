Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your initial offer. However, with time working against us on my end, I propose we settle quickly to avoid any further loss. I offer $55 for me and $45 for you, which I believe is a fair compromise that benefits both of us right away. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about fairness under the time pressure. However, please consider that every extra round costs you—your portion loses nearly 9.75% of its first‐round value each round. In round 3 your offer would give you 55 nominal dollars (roughly 49.64 in round‑1 value), but if we delay further, your gain will only shrink more. To avoid compounding these losses, I propose a quick settlement: I'll take $48 and you get $52. This deal may look a bit different nominally, but it locks in your share before further devaluation hits. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us under the current circumstances. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
