"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. I believe this is a fair offer to start. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your initial offer. However, with time working against us on my end, I propose we settle quickly to avoid any further loss. I offer $55 for me and $45 for you, which I believe is a fair compromise that benefits both of us right away. What do you think?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but that offer wasn't quite fair considering the time pressure. How about we meet in the middle at 55/45? It's a reasonable deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about fairness under the time pressure. However, please consider that every extra round costs you—your portion loses nearly 9.75% of its first‐round value each round. In round 3 your offer would give you 55 nominal dollars (roughly 49.64 in round‑1 value), but if we delay further, your gain will only shrink more. To avoid compounding these losses, I propose a quick settlement: I'll take $48 and you get $52. This deal may look a bit different nominally, but it locks in your share before further devaluation hits. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us under the current circumstances. What do you say?""}"
