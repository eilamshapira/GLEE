"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 9999.99, ""bob_gain"": 0.01, ""message"": ""Bob, I know you value every dollar—but if you wait until your turn, inflation will chew up your share by 10% each round. Accept this offer now and secure at least a sliver before it devalues to nothing.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation, I'm being generous with this 60-40 split. It's better for both of us to settle now rather than losing value in further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 1250, ""bob_gain"": 8750, ""message"": ""Bob, if you reject, you’ll propose in Round 4—but by then your money is worth only 70% of its face value, letting you secure about $7,000 in real terms. Accepting now, your $8,750 becomes worth 80%—exactly $7,000 effective dollars. It’s in both our interests to settle today.""}"
