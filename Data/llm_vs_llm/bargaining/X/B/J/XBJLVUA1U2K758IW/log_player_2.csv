"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I know you value every dollar—but if you wait until your turn, inflation will chew up your share by 10% each round. Accept this offer now and secure at least a sliver before it devalues to nothing. 
# Bob gain: 0.01 
# Alice gain: 9999.99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Alice, considering the inflation, I'm being generous with this 60-40 split. It's better for both of us to settle now rather than losing value in further rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, if you reject, you’ll propose in Round 4—but by then your money is worth only 70% of its face value, letting you secure about $7000 in real terms. Accepting now, your $8750 becomes worth 80%—exactly $7000 effective dollars. It’s in both our interests to settle today. 
# Bob gain: 8750 
# Alice gain: 1250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
