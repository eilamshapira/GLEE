"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair but slightly advantageous split for myself, considering that rejecting offers leads to inflation that will hurt both parties.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

Let me explain my proposal to Bob: I suggest a 55/45 split, which is reasonably fair. If you reject this, we'll both lose value due to inflation in the next round, so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob is offering a 50-50 split
2. Due to inflation, my $5000 is now worth $4500 in round 1 value
3. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, any amount I get will be worth another 10% less
4. My best alternative (making another offer) would likely result in even lower real value for me

Given these factors, I should accept this offer. While it gives me less real value than my initial proposal would have, it's better than risking further inflation losses.
