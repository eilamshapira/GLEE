"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split while accounting for potential future inflation that would affect my gains.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split of $5,500 for me and $4,500 for Bob. This is slightly in my favor but still quite fair, considering that if Bob rejects and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me. I want to make a reasonable offer that Bob is likely to accept immediately to avoid losing value through inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I get $5000, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $4500 for me
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - But any amount I get will be worth another 10% less (20% less than original)
   - And Bob might reject again

The current offer gives me $4500 in effective value, which is less than what I proposed initially. However, if I reject and we continue, my bargaining position gets even weaker due to compounding inflation.
