"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you can still make a good profit.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. The $50 I would get is now worth 5% less due to inflation (effectively $47.50)
2. If I reject and we continue to next round, any future amount will be worth even less to me
3. A 50-50 split is quite fair, and getting $47.50 in value is better than risking further depreciation
4. Bob might become less cooperative if I reject a fair offer
