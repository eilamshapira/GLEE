"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. The current offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance.
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer in the next round.
3. But due to 10% inflation, if I reject, the $5000 I'm being offered now would be equivalent to $4500 in the next round.
4. I don't know how inflation affects Alice, so I can't be certain she would accept a more favorable offer to me in the next round.
5. A guaranteed $5000 now is better than risking a lower value in future rounds.
