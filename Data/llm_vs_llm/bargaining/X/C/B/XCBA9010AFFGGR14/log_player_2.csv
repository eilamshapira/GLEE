"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice is offering me a substantial amount of money, I believe we can reach a more equitable distribution. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, though I need to consider the 5% inflation effect on my share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of the money. This is fair to both of us and ensures we both walk away with a significant amount. I understand time causes inflation for me, so I hope you'll accept this balanced offer so we can both benefit without further devaluation."
