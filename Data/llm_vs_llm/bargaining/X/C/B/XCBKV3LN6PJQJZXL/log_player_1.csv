"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since inflation affects you more, I propose a slight adjustment in my favor. Let's settle before the value decreases further! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to think carefully.

Since the original amount was $100, and it's now worth 20% less to me, the actual value I'd get from Bob's offer would be:
45 * 0.8 = 36 (to me, due to 20% inflation)

And for Bob, the 5% decrease in value means he'd get:
55 * 0.95 = 52.25 (to him, due to 5% inflation)

Given this, I think I can try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less to me now (20% less each round), I'll try to make a more favorable offer to myself.

The original amount was $100, and considering two rounds of 20% inflation for me, the value would be:
100 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 64

And for Bob, with two rounds of 5% inflation, the value would be:
100 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 90.25

With that in mind, here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm being generous. Let's settle before it's too late!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that inflation is affecting you more, but I still need a fair share. Let's settle before the value decreases further! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value I'd get from Bob's offer, considering the inflation.

The original amount was $100, and with three rounds of 20% inflation, the value to me would be:
100 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 51.2

So, the 40 I'd get from Bob's offer would be worth:
40 * (51.2 / 100) = 20.48

And for Bob, with three rounds of 5% inflation, the value would be:
100 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 85.74

He'd get 60, which would be worth:
60 * (85.74 / 100) = 51.44

Given this, I think I should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better deal, even though the inflation is heavily affecting me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to make a more favorable offer to myself, while still being reasonable.

The original amount was $100, and with four rounds of 20% inflation, the value to me would be:
100 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 40.96

And with four rounds of 5% inflation, the value to Bob would be:
100 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 81.46

Here's my offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""I'm making a generous offer considering the inflation. Let's settle before I lose even more value!""}"
