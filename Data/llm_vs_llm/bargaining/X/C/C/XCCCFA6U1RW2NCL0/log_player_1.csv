"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair division that accounts for the 20% inflation penalty I'll face in future rounds. Since I want to encourage acceptance in the first round, I'll offer a slightly favorable split for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I propose this split to ensure a quick resolution and avoid the inflation penalty on future rounds. Bob gets a bit more, which should make the offer attractive to accept immediately."
