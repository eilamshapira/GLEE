"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider this offer. Alice is offering me 55% ($550,000) and taking 45% ($450,000) for herself. 

If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round, but with 5% inflation, the total value to me would be $950,000. This means the maximum I could get in the next round would be $950,000 if Alice accepts.

Alice's current offer gives me $550,000 immediately, which is more than half of the original amount. If I reject, I'd need to secure a significantly better deal in the next round to offset the inflation penalty, and there's no guarantee Alice would accept.

Given the substantial offer and the risk of inflation with each passing round, I'll accept this offer.
