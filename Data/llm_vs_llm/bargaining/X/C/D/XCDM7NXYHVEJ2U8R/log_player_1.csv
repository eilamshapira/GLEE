  ""bob_gain"": 4000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose we split the money 50/50. This way, we both get an equal share and minimize the risk of losing value to inflation in future rounds. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
