6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the fact that we both lose money over time.,Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. We both face inflation penalties, and while mine is higher (10% vs your 5%), an equal split acknowledges that we both need to reach agreement quickly to maximize our total value. This balanced proposal respects both our interests.",Bob,2,
