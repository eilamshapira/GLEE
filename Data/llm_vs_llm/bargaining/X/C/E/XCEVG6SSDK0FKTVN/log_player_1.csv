"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. We both face inflation penalties, and while mine is higher (10% vs your 5%), an equal split acknowledges that we both need to reach agreement quickly to maximize our total value. This balanced proposal respects both our interests. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
