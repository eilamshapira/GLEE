"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the fact that we both lose money over time. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer where I would get $4000 and she would get $6000.

Given the inflation rates (10% for me, 5% for Alice), it's important to consider if I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer. Since my inflation penalty is higher, I need to weigh whether waiting is worth it.

If I reject now and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total pot will effectively be worth less to both of us. I could propose a more favorable split for myself, but must consider that Alice might also reject.

Based on the inflation rates and number of rounds remaining, I'll reject this initial offer to make my own proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I think a 50-50 split is the fairest approach. We both face inflation penalties, and while mine is higher (10% vs your 5%), an equal split acknowledges that we both need to reach agreement quickly to maximize our total value. This balanced proposal respects both our interests.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the sentiment behind your 50/50 offer, but the inflation disproportionately affects you. I'm proposing a slightly adjusted split that still allows you to gain more than waiting for another round. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's new offer where I would get $4300 and she would get $5700.

This is better than her first offer of $4000 to me. I need to consider the inflation impact:
- My inflation rate is 10% per round, now accumulated to 19%
- Alice's inflation rate is 5% per round, now at 9.75%

If I reject and we continue to round 4, inflation will further reduce our potential gains. Given the higher inflation rate that affects me (10% vs Alice's 5%), delaying agreement hurts me more than it hurts Alice.

While I could push for a slightly better deal, the risk of continued negotiation with my higher inflation rate makes this reasonable offer acceptable.
