"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but you get a decent starting point. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is quite low for me ($10,000 out of $1,000,000)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. The 5% inflation penalty per round means my money will be worth less if I wait
4. However, the current offer is so low that even with inflation, I can likely get a better deal by negotiating

$10,000 is only 1% of the total amount, which is extremely unfair. Even with the inflation penalty, I should try to negotiate for a better share. I can make a more reasonable counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while acknowledging the inflation pressure on my side:

{""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Let's be more fair. I'm offering you a slight advantage (55%) since I have inflation pressure, but this is a much more reasonable split that benefits us both.""}

This offer is strategic because:
1. It's much fairer than the initial 99/1 split
2. I'm giving Alice a slight advantage to make it more attractive
3. I acknowledge the inflation pressure by giving her more
4. It's reasonable enough that rejecting it would cost Alice potential gains through further negotiations"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a significant share to make this worthwhile. Let's work towards a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice has increased her offer from $10,000 to $100,000, showing some willingness to negotiate
2. However, $100,000 is still only 10% of the total, which remains quite unfair
3. With 9.75% inflation, my $100,000 would be worth about $90,250
4. We still have 9 rounds left, but each round my position weakens due to inflation
5. However, the current offer is still too low to accept, as even with several rounds of inflation, I should be able to negotiate for a much better share

If I reject, I can make another counter-offer that's more balanced but perhaps slightly more favorable to Alice than my last offer, showing I'm also willing to compromise.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll adjust my offer to show more flexibility while still aiming for a reasonable split:

{""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""I've increased your share to 60% to show I'm willing to compromise. This is a fair offer considering both our positions - you get a clear majority, and I get a reasonable share. Further delays will only reduce the value of my share due to inflation, which hurts both of us.""}

This offer is strategic because:
1. I've increased Alice's share from my previous offer (from 55% to 60%)
2. It shows I'm willing to make real concessions
3. It's still reasonable enough to give me a meaningful share
4. I remind Alice that inflation is hurting my position, which means delaying only makes future negotiations harder
5. The 60/40 split is a significant improvement from her 90/10 offer, but still gives her a clear majority"
