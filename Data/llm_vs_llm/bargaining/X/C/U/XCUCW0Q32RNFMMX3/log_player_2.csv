"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split this fairly. I propose I get $55 and you get $45. This is a good starting point! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $45 and she gets $55. If I reject and move to the next round, I'll face 10% inflation, meaning any amount would be worth less to me. However, I might be able to propose a more favorable split.

Given the inflation effect, I should consider that $45 now is worth more than potentially getting a higher nominal amount in future rounds. The 10% inflation is significant.
