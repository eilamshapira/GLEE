"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 60/40 in my favor. It's a good deal for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 60/40 split in her favor, giving me $400,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will decrease by 20% for me, meaning the full amount would be worth $800,000 to me. Even if I were to get a better percentage in the next round, I need to factor in this significant depreciation.

Given the substantial inflation penalty I face (20% vs Alice's 10%), and the fact that $400,000 is a significant sum, this isn't an unreasonable first offer.
