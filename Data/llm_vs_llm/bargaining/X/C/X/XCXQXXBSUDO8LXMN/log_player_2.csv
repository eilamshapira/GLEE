Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since we couldn't agree on the previous splits, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor this time. Inflation is reducing the value of the money quickly, especially for me. Let's end this soon so we both can benefit. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is getting very favorable terms due to the fast devaluation of her share. While waiting is risky, I'm hoping to get her closer to a 50/50 split as the game progresses."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is hitting me hard, and we're running out of time. I'm willing to meet you halfway with a 52.5-47.5 split in my favor. Let's end this now before our shares lose even more value. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is the best offer I can realistically expect at this point. Accepting now locks in a reasonable share before inflation further erodes the value."
