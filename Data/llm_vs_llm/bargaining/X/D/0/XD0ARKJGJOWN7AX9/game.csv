53.0,47.0,"Bob, I'm proposing a fair split considering the inflation I face. Since we're in round 3, I've already lost about 10% of value. A 53/47 split helps offset this disadvantage while still giving you a good portion. Let's agree now before inflation reduces the value further for me.",Alice,3,
