"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fair split taking into account the 5% inflation I face per round. If we don't agree now, by the next round the money is worth less to me, so this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's keep it simple and split it evenly. 50/50.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm proposing a fair split considering the inflation I face. Since we're in round 3, I've already lost about 10% of value. A 53/47 split helps offset this disadvantage while still giving you a good portion. Let's agree now before inflation reduces the value further for me. 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is exaggerating the impact of inflation and trying to leverage it for a better deal.  While it's true the value decreases over time, it's not a drastic difference yet. I'll hold out for a more balanced offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 49, ""alice_gain"": 51, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the inflation puts you at a slight disadvantage. This offer recognizes that while still being fair to both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're now at round 5 and I've lost almost 20% of value due to inflation. I'm meeting you in the middle with this 52/48 split. It's very close to your last offer and acknowledges both of our positions. Let's agree now to avoid further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is still overselling the inflation impact and trying to inch her gain upwards. While a 52/48 split is getting closer to acceptable, I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can secure a slightly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. 50/50 is the fairest split. Take it or leave it.""}"
