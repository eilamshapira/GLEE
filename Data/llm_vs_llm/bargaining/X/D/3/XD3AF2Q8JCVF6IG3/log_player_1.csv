"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair deal""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a slightly better outcome for myself. This offer ensures a decent share for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll calculate the actual value of Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me, the $40 offered is equivalent to $40 * 0.95 = $38.

As for Bob's gain, the money is worth 10% less for him, so the $60 he offered himself is equivalent to $60 * 0.9 = $54 for him.

Given this, I think I can do better. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth even less. For me, it's 5% less than the previous round, which was already 5% less than the initial round. So, the total decrease for me is 5% + 5% = 10% (compounded: 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025). For Bob, it's 10% less than the previous round, which was already 10% less than the initial round. So, the total decrease for Bob is 10% + 10% = 20% (compounded: 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Considering inflation, this seems like a fair split now""}"
