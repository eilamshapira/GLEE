"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal that considers the inflation factor affecting Bob. Since I (Alice) don't experience any inflation while Bob faces 10% inflation each round, waiting is more costly for him than for me.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000}

I suggest this division because it gives both of us a substantial portion while acknowledging that I have a slightly stronger position due to the inflation dynamics. I'm offering you a fair portion now rather than risking further negotiation where the same amount would be worth less to you in future rounds."
