"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 in the first round
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 10% less
3. The 60-40 split favors Alice significantly
4. But with inflation, if I reject, my next round's bargaining power is with $900,000 effective value
5. I can potentially get a better deal, even accounting for the 10% loss

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while accounting for the 10% inflation I'm facing:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I propose a more balanced 55-45 split. This is fairer for both of us, and we can avoid further inflation losses by agreeing now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of our previous offers, 58-42 split, to minimize inflation loss 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice's offering $420,000, but with 19% inflation, it's effectively worth about $340,200 to me
2. She's moved slightly from her initial 60-40 split, but not much
3. If I reject, next round will have 27% inflation for me
4. We've already used 3 rounds out of 12
5. While I could try for a better deal, the increasing inflation is becoming a significant factor
6. The difference between this and my last proposal isn't worth the inflation risk

I'll accept this offer to secure a decent amount before inflation erodes it further.
