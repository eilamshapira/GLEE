Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think a 55/45 split is more fair. This way, we both get a reasonable share, and the impact of inflation is mitigated. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
