"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, a 50/50 split seems fair at first glance, but let's be strategic. We both lose money to inflation each round. This offer lets me get a slight advantage while still giving you a good chunk before inflation eats away at it too much. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
