""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, a 50/50 split seems fair at first glance, but let's be strategic. We both lose money to inflation each round. This offer lets me get a slight advantage while still giving you a good chunk before inflation eats away at it too much.""

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your strategy, but let's find a middle ground. My offer gives you more than half while still ensuring I get a fair share before inflation hits us harder. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500
