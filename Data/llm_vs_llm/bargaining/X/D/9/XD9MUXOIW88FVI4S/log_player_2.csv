"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose splitting the money 60-40 in my favor since I initiated the offer. It's a fair start and allows us both to walk away with a good amount 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is proposing to give me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I need to account for the 5% inflation that affects only me. That means in the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me, so each dollar would be worth $0.95 to me.

If I reject now and propose something better next round, Alice could reject my offer, and by round 3, inflation would reduce the value further for me. The longer this negotiation goes, the worse it gets for me due to the asymmetric inflation.

Since this is just the first round and I'm already being offered 40% of the total, which is a substantial amount, I'll accept.
