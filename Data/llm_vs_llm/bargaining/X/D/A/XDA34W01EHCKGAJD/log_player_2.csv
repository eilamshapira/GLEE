Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 8750 
# Alice gain: 1250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice's offer is getting better, and the effects of inflation are becoming more significant. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount."
