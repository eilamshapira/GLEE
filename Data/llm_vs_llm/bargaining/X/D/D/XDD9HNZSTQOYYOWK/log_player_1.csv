"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a split that considers both our interests and the inflation penalty. Since Bob faces a steeper inflation penalty (20% vs my 5%), he has more incentive to accept early.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this 60-40 split because it's fair enough to incentivize acceptance while giving me a good portion. If Bob rejects, his next offer will be worth less to both of us due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

My 55$ in round 2 is worth: 55 * 0.95 = 52.25$
(If I reject and we go to round 3, further inflation will reduce values more)

This is a reasonable offer considering:
1. It's still a substantial amount
2. The inflation penalty makes waiting costly
3. Bob made a fairly balanced counteroffer
4. Rejecting would mean both of us lose more value
