Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation and the fact that we're losing value each round, I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. It's still close to fair, but it accounts for the risk and the decreasing value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
