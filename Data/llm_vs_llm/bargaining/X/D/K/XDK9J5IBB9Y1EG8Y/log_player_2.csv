"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll propose a more balanced split in the next round. This offer gives me nothing, which is clearly unfair."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor to account for the time pressure I'm under due to inflation. This is still a fair offer that gives Alice a substantial portion while protecting my interests against the 20% loss per round."
