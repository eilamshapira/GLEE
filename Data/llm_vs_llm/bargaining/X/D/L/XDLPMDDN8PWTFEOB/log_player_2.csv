"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. I believe this is a fair start considering I'm taking the initiative. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice's offer of 40$ for me isn't terrible, but it's less than an equal split. Since I'll get to make the next offer if I reject, I could propose a more favorable split. However, there's also a risk that any future negotiations could lead to worse outcomes if we can't agree.

Given that 40$ is still a substantial portion and it's important to secure a deal, I'll reject this offer to try for a better split.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a fair 50-50 split, which is the most equitable solution.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I suggest we split it equally at 50-50. This is the fairest solution for both of us, and it ensures we both walk away satisfied.""}"
