"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money equally to make sure we both get a fair share from the start. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which is traditionally considered fair
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less next round (total value = $9,000)
3. Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, we're already losing value
4. A 50-50 split in the first round avoids any risk and gives me a solid $5,000
