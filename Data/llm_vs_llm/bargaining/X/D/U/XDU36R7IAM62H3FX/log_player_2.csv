"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose an even split: $500000 each. By accepting this fair division now we both secure our full share immediately. Looking forward to your agreement! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice offers a 50-50 split ($500,000 each)
2. If I reject, the next round's money will be worth 20% less to me
3. If I make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more value loss
4. A fair split in round 1 guarantees me the maximum value of my share
5. There's no guarantee I could get a better deal in later rounds, considering the inflation penalty

The 50-50 split is fair, and any delay would only reduce the value of my share. It's best to secure $500,000 now rather than risk getting less value in future rounds.
