"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
 
Let's see how this plays out in further rounds. Alice is getting a better deal right now, but her money loses value faster."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
``` 

Let's see if Alice accepts this counter-offer. It's a reversal of her proposal, but now there's pressure since the value of the money is decreasing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While not ideal, this offer is better than what I might get in future rounds if Alice plays strategically. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I'd rather secure a decent amount now than risk getting even less later."
