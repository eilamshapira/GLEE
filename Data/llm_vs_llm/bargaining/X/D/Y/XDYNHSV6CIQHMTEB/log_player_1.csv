"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want a fair split, but considering the inflation affecting me, I need a bit more. This offer still gives you a substantial amount. Accepting this ensures we both get a good deal before the money loses more value for me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
