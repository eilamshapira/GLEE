"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more to account for the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation risk, but a 60/40 split is too skewed.  How about we go with a more balanced approach that still gives you a slight edge?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet closer to the middle, but I still need a cushion for inflation. This offer is fair. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, the inflation is working against me much faster than her. It's worth risking another round to try and secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""The inflation is hitting me hard Alice, we need to find a solution quickly. This offer is a compromise, giving me slightly more to offset the rapid devaluation on my end.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. Inflation is hurting both of us. A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to end this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, a 50/50 split is now the most logical choice. The longer this goes on, the more value we both lose. Accepting now minimizes further losses from inflation."
