"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $45 while keeping $55
- It's a relatively fair split, close to 50-50
- If I reject, the total amount will decrease by 5% next round (to $95)
- Even if I propose a better split next round, the smaller total means I might not gain much more
- First round negotiations often set the tone, and this is a reasonable opening offer
