"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting this is a fair starting point. Your turn to respond as Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair. Let's make this quick! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider the actual value of the offer.

The offer is $450,000, but due to inflation, it's worth 20% less, so the actual value is:
$450,000 * 0.8 = $360,000

Considering this, I think I can do better. 

My response is: {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than in Round 2, which means it's 20% * 2 = 40% less than in Round 1 (compounding the inflation).

However, I'll make an offer that takes into account the current situation. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""My turn again! Let's try a 55/45 split in my favor this time.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $550,000 and giving Bob $450,000. The message is a simple explanation of my offer. Your turn to respond as Bob!"
