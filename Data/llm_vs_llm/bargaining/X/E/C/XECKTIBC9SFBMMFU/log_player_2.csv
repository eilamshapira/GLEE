Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the million with me taking 60% and you getting 40%. It's a fair start, considering I initiated the proposal. What do you think?

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I don't think a 60-40 split in your favor is fair just for making the first move. I propose a more balanced split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is still generous considering we're equal partners in this negotiation.""}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see your point about fairness. Let's go for an even split, 50-50. That way, we both walk away with half a million dollars. How does that sound?

# Alice gain: 500000
