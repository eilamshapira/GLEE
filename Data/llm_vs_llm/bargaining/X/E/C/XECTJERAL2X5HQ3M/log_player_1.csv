Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a better deal for me, but still a good chunk of money for you, and we avoid losing everything. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
