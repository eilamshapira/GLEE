"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- It's a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair
- If I reject, we'll lose 5% value in the next round
- Even if I made a more aggressive offer next round, the loss in value might not be worth it
- This is the first round, and getting a fair split right away is good
