"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. It's Round 1, I'm Alice, and I need to propose a division of $100, keeping in mind the potential for inflation affecting me in future rounds. I want to make a reasonable offer that Bob will accept, but also secure a good portion for myself.

Here's my proposal:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, it's Round 2. Bob rejected my initial offer and has now proposed a split where I get $40 and he gets $60. Remember that for me, due to inflation, $40 now is worth 10% less than $40 in round 1, so the real value of this deal is equivalent to having about 36.36$ in round 1

Given the limited number of rounds and the inflation, I need to consider whether rejecting this offer is worth the risk of getting even less in the future. While I'd prefer a better split, rejecting this would leave me with 10 rounds of negotiation. Let's calculate the value of the deal if I refuse: 
If Bob is also affected by inflation, maybe he will propose something less biased next turn. If Bob isn't affected, I'm getting played.

I'll take the risk.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's Round 3. Inflation continues to be a factor for me. Therefore, I need to offer a better deal to Bob, or he may reject again. My gains are now worth 20% less than in round 1.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, it's Round 4. Inflation is really starting to bite now. Bob rejected my previous offer, and he's now proposing I get only $35. This is worth about $25.51 in round 1 value due to the 27.1% inflation.

While I don't like this offer at all, I'm starting to get concerned about the limited number of rounds. Rejecting means I risk getting even less. I need to consider the possibility that Bob isn't subject to inflation, in which case he has a strong incentive to keep rejecting until I'm forced to accept a very low offer.

Given the risk of further inflation and the decreasing number of rounds, I reluctantly accept.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
