"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's start this off with a fair split. I'll take $4800 and you take $5200. I think this is a good and balanced offer to kick things off. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice's offer is actually quite reasonable. She's offering me $5200 (52%) while taking $4800 (48%).

Given that:
1. This is just the first round
2. Each round reduces my money's value by 10%
3. If I reject and propose next round, my $5200 would already be worth only $4680 (5200 * 0.9)
4. We risk getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
5. She's already giving me the larger share

This is a fair opening offer that favors me slightly. Rejecting it would likely lead to worse outcomes due to inflation.
