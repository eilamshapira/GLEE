"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer in the next round
3. But due to 10% inflation, in the next round the $5000 I could get would be worth only $4500 to me
4. If Alice rejects my counter-offer, we'd go to round 3 where any amount would be worth even less
5. The risk of getting less due to inflation outweighs the potential benefit of negotiating for more

Given these factors, a 50-50 split in the first round is actually a good deal for me.
