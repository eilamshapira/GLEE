"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer, considering that Bob's money loses 10% value each round while mine doesn't depreciate. I'll propose a division that's slightly in my favor but not too aggressive.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

The reasoning behind my offer: I give Bob a substantial portion ($4000) to show good faith, while keeping a larger share ($6000) for myself. Since Bob's money will be worth less if he rejects this offer and waits for future rounds, this gives him an incentive to accept now rather than delay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
- I would get $5500
- Bob would get $4500, but due to 10% inflation, it's actually worth $4050 to him

This is actually a reasonable offer. While it's less than my initial proposal for myself ($6000), it's still a fair split. If I reject and we continue to later rounds, Bob's share will continue to depreciate, which might make negotiations more difficult. Additionally, there's always the risk of not reaching an agreement within 12 rounds, resulting in both of us getting nothing.
