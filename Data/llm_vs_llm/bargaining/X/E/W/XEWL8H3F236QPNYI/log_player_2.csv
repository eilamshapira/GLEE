"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject this 50-50 split and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. So even if I managed to get a better percentage in round 2, I might end up with less actual value.

The current offer gives me $50, which is a fair split. If I reject, any amount I get in round 2 would effectively be worth 20% less. So even if I got $60 in round 2, it would only be worth $48 to me - less than the current offer.

Therefore, I should accept this fair offer now rather than risk getting less value after inflation.
