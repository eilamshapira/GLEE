"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is unfair, so I propose a 55-45 split in my favor as I'm giving you a chance to reconsider and still get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The 55-45 split is a reasonable compromise, and while it's slightly in Bob's favor, it's still a fair distribution that avoids prolonging the negotiation. Better to secure $45 now than risk a less favorable outcome in subsequent rounds."
