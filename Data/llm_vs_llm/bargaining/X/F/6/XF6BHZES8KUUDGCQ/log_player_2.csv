"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer ensures you get a good share while I get a bit more considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me after each round, I'll take that into account for my offer. The total amount is now worth $950,000 to me (1,000,000 * 0.95).

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The longer this goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for you. I'm offering a deal that still benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 9.75% less for me after each round (5% in round 1 and 4.75% in round 2, which is approximately 0.95 * 0.9525 = 0.9044 or 9.56% less, but considering the 5% decrease for this round, it is 5% + 4.75% = 9.75% as stated), I'll take that into account for my offer. However, to simplify, after two rounds of 5% decrease, the total amount is now worth $902,500 to me (1,000,000 * 0.95 * 0.95).

But considering the correct decrease: 
Round 1: 1,000,000 * 0.95 = 950,000
Round 2: 950,000 * 0.95 = 902,500
Round 3: 902,500 * 0.95 = 857,375

The total amount is now worth $857,375 to me.
