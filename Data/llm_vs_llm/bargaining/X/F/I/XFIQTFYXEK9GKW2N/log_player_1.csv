"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a fair split where you get $4,500 and I get $5,500. Since your money loses 5% value each round, accepting now means you get more real value than a larger amount later.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about I get $4750 and you get $5250? This way, you still get a larger share, but I get a bit more to compensate for the inflation I'm experiencing. 
# Alice gain: 5250 
# Bob gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a reasonable counter-offer from Bob. He's offering me slightly less than my initial proposal ($5250 vs $5500), but it's still a good share of the total amount. Since there's no inflation impact on my end, and continuing to negotiate would only decrease Bob's effective gain due to his 5% inflation rate, it makes sense to accept this fair compromise now."
