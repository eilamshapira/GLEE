"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a fair split where you get $4500 and I get $5500. Since your money loses 5% value each round, accepting now means you get more real value than a larger amount later. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's wait for a better offer next round, considering the inflation for you is 5% each round."
