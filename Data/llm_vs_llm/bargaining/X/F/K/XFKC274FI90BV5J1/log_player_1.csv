I'm starting with a 99/1 split, hoping to secure a large share early on. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting this offer. While it's a 50/50 split, it's still significantly less than my initial offer.  I'm confident I can do better with a few more rounds. Let's see what I can offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 90/10.  This is a good compromise that hopefully incentivizes Bob to accept before we get too deep into the game and the inflation starts to really hurt."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although it's a large chunk of money, I'm not willing to accept anything less than 800,000, considering the inflation factor. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm dropping my offer to 80/20. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I'm still aiming for the majority share.  We're getting close to the halfway point, so I need to secure a deal soon."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired range, I'm still aiming for a bigger share.  With the inflation hitting Bob harder, I think I can still do better in the next few rounds."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm making one final attempt to compromise. I'm offering 75/25, which is a significant improvement on my previous offer.  With the inflation hitting Bob hard, I'm hoping this is enough to convince him to accept before the next round."
