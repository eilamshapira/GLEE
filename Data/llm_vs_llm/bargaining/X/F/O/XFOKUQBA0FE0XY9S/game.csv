550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair division where I get $550000 and you get $450000. I'm facing a 5% inflation penalty per round, so it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a substantial portion while recognizing that I'm at a disadvantage due to inflation. Let's settle this now and both walk away with a good deal.",Alice,1,
