"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me propose a fair division while considering that future rounds will decrease the value for me due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because it gives both of us a substantial portion, with a slight advantage to me since I'm making the first offer. If Bob rejects this, we'll move to the next round where the $100 will only be worth $90 to me due to inflation, so this is a reasonable first offer."
