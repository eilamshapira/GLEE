"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it fairly. I'm offering you $450000. This is a good starting point, and we can avoid losing money to inflation. Let's secure a good deal now! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me $450,000 out of $1,000,000 (45%)
2. If I reject, the next round will have 10% inflation for me
3. If I make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it, leading to further inflation losses
4. The current offer is fairly reasonable, close to a 50-50 split
5. Securing a good deal early avoids the risk of ending up with nothing after 12 rounds
6. $450,000 is a substantial amount, and the 10% inflation risk makes waiting risky

Given these factors, this is actually a pretty fair offer. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of inflation and potential further negotiations could lead to worse outcomes.
