"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation for me, the total value will be worth only $9000 from my perspective
4. My $4000 now is better than a potential $5000+ next round that would be worth less due to inflation

While the split isn't exactly equal, accepting $4000 now is better than risking further negotiations with value deterioration.
