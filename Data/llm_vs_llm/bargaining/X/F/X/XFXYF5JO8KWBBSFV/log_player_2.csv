"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair! I propose a 55/45 split. This is a generous offer considering potential inflation for me in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 450,000$
2. If I reject and propose next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me
3. 450,000$ now is better than potentially getting slightly more in the next round but with 5% inflation
4. We have a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
5. This is a reasonable first offer, not too far from 50/50

Given these factors, especially the inflation penalty and the risk of getting nothing, I think it's wise to accept this offer. The difference between 45% and 50% doesn't justify the risk and inflation loss of continuing.
