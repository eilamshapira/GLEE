"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think strategically about Alice's offer. She's offering me $4,000 out of $10,000, which is 40% of the total.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in round 2, but the money will be worth 10% less to me (effectively $9,000 in value for me). However, I'll have control over the proposal.

Given that we have a limited number of rounds (12) and each round decreases the value by 10% for me, waiting too long is costly. Also, Alice's first offer of 40% is somewhat reasonable - not perfectly equal but not terribly unfair either.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a split where I get 55% and Alice gets 45%. This is a bit more favorable to me than her initial offer was to her, but not so extreme that she should automatically reject it. This way we can reach an agreement quickly and minimize the impact of inflation on my gains."
