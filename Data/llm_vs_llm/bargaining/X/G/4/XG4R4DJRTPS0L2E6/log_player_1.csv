Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly at 50-50. It's fair and square, considering the value decreases for you each round. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
