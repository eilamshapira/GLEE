I'm adjusting my strategy slightly to seem more flexible, but I'm aiming to secure a favorable outcome before inflation significantly impacts potential gains."

Bob's offers are getting worse with the inflation working in my favor. I'll hold out for a better deal."

I'm lowering my demand slightly, but still aiming for a larger share while the inflation disproportionately affects Bob's potential gains."

Round 7

I'm going for a 50/50 split now. This seems fair and with the inflation heavily impacting Bob, it's unlikely he'll get a better offer at this point. It's better to secure something than risk getting nothing."
