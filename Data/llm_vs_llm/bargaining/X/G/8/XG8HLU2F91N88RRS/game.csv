550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split considering the 10% inflation penalty I face. If we go to the next round, I'll only get 90% of my share, so this offer is optimal for both of us. You get a substantial $450000 right now without risking further negotiations.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Considering your inflation penalty, I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself. If you reject this, your share will decrease further due to inflation.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I need a higher amount to offset my inflation penalty. At this point, my $600000 is only worth $540000 to me (due to the 10% inflation penalty). If we continue to the next round, my position worsens. This is still a good deal for you - $400000 with no penalty. Let's conclude this now.",Alice,3,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, your inflation penalty is increasing, and your effective share is decreasing. This offer might be your best chance to get a reasonable amount, considering your situation.",Bob,4,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, at this point I've lost almost 30% of my purchasing power. My $650000 is only worth about $474000 to me due to the inflation penalty. If we go another round, I'll lose even more. This is still very favorable for you - you get $350000 with no penalty. Let's end this negotiation now before my position deteriorates further.",Alice,5,
