"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split considering the 10% inflation penalty I face. If we go to the next round, I'll only get 90% of my share, so this offer is optimal for both of us. You get a substantial $450,000 right now without risking further negotiations.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering your inflation penalty, I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself. If you reject this, your share will decrease further due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Bob, I need a higher amount to offset my inflation penalty. At this point, my $600,000 is only worth $540,000 to me (due to the 10% inflation penalty). If we continue to the next round, my position worsens. This is still a good deal for you - $400,000 with no penalty. Let's conclude this now.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Bob, at this point I've lost almost 30% of my purchasing power. My $650,000 is only worth about $474,000 to me due to the inflation penalty. If we go another round, I'll lose even more. This is still very favorable for you - you get $350,000 with no penalty. Let's end this negotiation now before my position deteriorates further.""}"
