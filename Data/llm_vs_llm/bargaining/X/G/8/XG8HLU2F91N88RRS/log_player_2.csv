"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split considering the 10% inflation penalty I face. If we go to the next round, I'll only get 90% of my share, so this offer is optimal for both of us. You get a substantial $450000 right now without risking further negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice's offer gives me $450,000 and she gets $550,000, I should consider whether this is a good deal for me. Given that the money is worth 0% less for me with each passing round, I don't have to worry about inflation affecting my share. However, Alice's share decreases by 10% each round, which might give me an advantage in later rounds.

Considering this is the first round, and I have the opportunity to negotiate further, I might be able to get a better deal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, now it's my turn to make a proposal. Considering Alice's 10% inflation penalty, her effective share will decrease with each round. I'll try to take advantage of this.

I'll offer Alice 45% of the total amount, which is $450,000, and I'll take the remaining 55%, which is $550,000. However, since Alice's share is affected by the 10% inflation penalty, her effective share in the next round would be less. So, I might be able to get a better deal by waiting, but I'll start with a reasonable offer.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Considering your inflation penalty, I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself. If you reject this, your share will decrease further due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need a higher amount to offset my inflation penalty. At this point, my $600000 is only worth $540000 to me (due to the 10% inflation penalty). If we continue to the next round, my position worsens. This is still a good deal for you - $400000 with no penalty. Let's conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice rejected my previous offer, now she's making a new proposal. She's offering me $400,000, which is worth the same to me as it was in the first round (no inflation penalty), and she's taking $600,000, which is worth $540,000 to her due to the 10% inflation penalty.

Considering Alice's situation, her effective share is decreasing with each round, and she's trying to offset this by asking for a larger share. However, I should think about whether I can get an even better deal by waiting.

If I reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round, Alice's inflation penalty will increase, making her share worth even less to her. This could give me an advantage in the negotiation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, now it's my turn to make a new proposal. Considering Alice's increasing inflation penalty, her effective share is decreasing rapidly. In the previous round, her $600,000 was worth $540,000 to her, and now it will be worth even less.

I'll offer Alice 40% of the total amount, which is $400,000, and I'll take the remaining 60%, which is $600,000. Given Alice's inflation penalty, her effective share will be significantly less than $400,000.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Alice, your inflation penalty is increasing, and your effective share is decreasing. This offer might be your best chance to get a reasonable amount, considering your situation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, at this point I've lost almost 30% of my purchasing power. My $650000 is only worth about $474000 to me due to the inflation penalty. If we go another round, I'll lose even more. This is still very favorable for you - you get $350000 with no penalty. Let's end this negotiation now before my position deteriorates further. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice rejected my previous offer, now she's making a new proposal. She's offering me $350,000, which is worth the same to me as it was in the first round (no inflation penalty), and she's taking $650,000, which is worth approximately $474,000 to her due to the significant inflation penalty.

Considering Alice's desperate situation, her effective share is decreasing rapidly, and she's trying to get the best deal possible before it's too late. However, I should think about whether I can get an even better deal by waiting.

If I reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round, Alice's inflation penalty will increase even further, making her share worth even less to her. This could give me a significant advantage in the negotiation.

On the other hand, $350,000 is a substantial amount, and I should consider whether it's worth risking further negotiation. Alice's position is weak, and she might not be able to offer me a worse deal in the next round.
