"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I should consider a fair division while accounting for the 10% inflation penalty I'll face if we proceed to the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50}

I suggest an even split of the $100. This is a fair division that gives us both equal amounts. It would be in both our interests to accept this offer now rather than continuing to future rounds where inflation will reduce the value for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully considering the inflation effects.

If I accept Bob's offer, I get $45 now, which is worth 45 Ã— 0.9 = $40.5 to me due to the 10% inflation from round 1.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3, I'll face another 10% inflation (total 20% from round 1). Even if I proposed a more favorable split, the value would be further reduced for me.

Given that Bob is also facing 20% inflation (which means his $55 is only worth $44 to him), this offer is relatively fair considering our respective inflation rates.
