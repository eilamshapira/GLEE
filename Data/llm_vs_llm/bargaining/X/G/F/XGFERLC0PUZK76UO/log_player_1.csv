"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that we split the money with $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you. It's a fair start, and we can both walk away with a good amount. Let me know if you agree!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. Considering the inflation, it's better to agree sooner rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
