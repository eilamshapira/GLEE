"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly and end the game quickly to avoid losing value 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is suggesting a 40-60 split in her favor. While this isn't an even split, I need to account for the inflation penalties. If I reject, I'll make an offer next round, but the total value will be worth 20% less to me and only 5% less to Alice.

That means in the next round, the $10,000 would effectively be worth $8,000 to me and $9,500 to Alice. This significant difference in inflation rates means delaying could hurt me more than Alice.

If I accept now, I get $4,000. If I reject and we eventually reach a ""fair"" 50-50 split in later rounds, inflation might actually leave me with less than $4,000 in effective value.
