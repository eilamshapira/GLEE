"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- It's a perfectly fair 50-50 split
- This is round 1 out of 12, so I could try to negotiate for more
- However, equal division is a standard fair solution
- There's risk in rejecting as Alice might propose less favorable terms

Given it's a fair offer right from the start, I'll accept it.
