"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm suggesting a fair split that accounts for the disadvantage I face with the 5% inflation penalty. If we delay until later rounds, my share becomes worth less, while yours doesn't change in value. This offer gives us both substantial value right away without risking getting nothing in round 12. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer carefully.

Alice is proposing I get $4,500 and she gets $5,500 out of the $10,000 total. She's justifying the uneven split by mentioning the 5% inflation penalty she faces each round, while I don't face any inflation.

This is actually an important consideration. If we delay, each round makes Alice's potential earnings worth less to her, while my value stays constant. This creates an asymmetric negotiation position.

While a 45/55 split isn't 50/50, Alice's reasoning about the inflation penalty is valid. Also, accepting now guarantees we both get a substantial amount rather than risking getting nothing in round 12.

Given these factors, this seems like a reasonable first-round offer.
