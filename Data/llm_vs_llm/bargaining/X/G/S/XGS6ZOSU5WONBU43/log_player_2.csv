"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's share evenly. It's fair for both of us to start! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer is 50$ for me
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   - The money will be worth 10% less for me
   - Maximum I could get would be 90$ (if Alice accepts), but that would only be worth 81$ due to inflation
   - Alice might reject, leading to further rounds and more inflation

Given that:
- 50$ now is better than risking further inflation
- The offer is fair and reasonable
- Building goodwill with a fair split might be valuable
- There's no guarantee Alice would accept a more aggressive offer
