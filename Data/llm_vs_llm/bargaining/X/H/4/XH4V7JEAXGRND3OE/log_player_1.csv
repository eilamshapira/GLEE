"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your proposal! I think a 52.5/47.5 split would be more fair. It's still a slight advantage for me, acknowledging that I'm making the first move, but closer to an even split. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
