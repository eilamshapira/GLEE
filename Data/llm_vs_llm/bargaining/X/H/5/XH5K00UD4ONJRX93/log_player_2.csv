Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but the inflation is cutting into our potential gains. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice is acknowledging the inflation, her offer still heavily favors her. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to be taken advantage of."

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm acknowledging the time pressure and the inflation impact. This is a compromise - slightly more than your offer, but with less time wasted. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting frustrating. While Alice acknowledges the inflation, her offer still doesn't reflect the reality of its impact.  She's inching up, but it's not enough."
