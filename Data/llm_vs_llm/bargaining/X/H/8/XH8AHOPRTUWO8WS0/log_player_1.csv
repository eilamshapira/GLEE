"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself since Bob might be affected differently by inflation and this gives room for negotiation.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a reasonable starting offer that gives both of us a significant portion while leaving room for negotiation if Bob declines."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept now:
   * I would get $50, but with 20% inflation = $40 effective value
   * This is significantly less than my initial proposal of $60

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * The money will be worth even less (another 20% reduction)
   * Any amount I get will be worth only 64% of original value
   * Making future rounds much less attractive

3. Bob's offer is fair in nominal terms (50-50 split)
   * Even though it's worth less to me due to inflation
   * Better than risking further devaluation

Given the steep inflation penalty I face and the risk of getting even less value in future rounds, I should accept this offer now.
