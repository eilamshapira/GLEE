"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that accounts for Bob's 20% per round inflation penalty while still being fair enough that he might accept.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a fair split considering that if Bob rejects, the next round's money will be worth 20% less to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept: I get $5,200
- If I reject: Next round I can make another offer, but Bob's value will decrease by another 20%
- Bob's current offer is actually quite reasonable given that I was asking for $6,000 in the first round
- The inflation penalty means Bob is motivated to conclude quickly

I will accept this offer as it's a fair compromise and the risk of continuing might lead to a worse outcome for both parties.
