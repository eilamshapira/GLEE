6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob! I'm proposing we split the money 60-40 in my favor. While this might seem uneven, remember that you face a 20% inflation penalty each round, so accepting now gives you the full value of $4000. If we delay, your share will effectively be worth less with each passing round, even if the nominal amount increases. This is a fair first offer that recognizes our different inflation rates.",Alice,1,
