"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing we split the money 60-40 in my favor. While this might seem uneven, remember that you face a 20% inflation penalty each round, so accepting now gives you the full value of $4,000. If we delay, your share will effectively be worth less with each passing round, even if the nominal amount increases. This is a fair first offer that recognizes our different inflation rates.""}"
