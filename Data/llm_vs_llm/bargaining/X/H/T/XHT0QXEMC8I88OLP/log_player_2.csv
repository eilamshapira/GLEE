"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing we split the money 60-40 in my favor. While this might seem uneven, remember that you face a 20% inflation penalty each round, so accepting now gives you the full value of $4000. If we delay, your share will effectively be worth less with each passing round, even if the nominal amount increases. This is a fair first offer that recognizes our different inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
