"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split of the 100$. We both get an equal share, ensuring cooperation and fairness. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I accept now, I get $50. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me, meaning even if I got the full $100 in the next round, it would only be worth $95 to me.

The current offer of $50 is fair and reasonable. Given the inflation penalty for delaying, I'm better off accepting this equal split now rather than risking getting less value in future rounds.
