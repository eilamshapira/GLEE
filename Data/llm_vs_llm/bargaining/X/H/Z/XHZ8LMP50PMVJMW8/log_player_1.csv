"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since Bob has the power to accept or reject.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose that I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount, while accounting for the fact that Bob can counter-offer if he's not satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $600,000 Ã— 0.95 = $570,000 (effective value due to 5% inflation)
   * This is better than my initial offer ($550,000)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round will have another 5% inflation for me
   * I can make a new offer, but the value will keep decreasing
   * Bob seems willing to make reasonable offers

Given that:
- This is a good offer (better than my initial proposal)
- Inflation will reduce value in future rounds
- We have limited rounds
- Bob has shown willingness to be fair
