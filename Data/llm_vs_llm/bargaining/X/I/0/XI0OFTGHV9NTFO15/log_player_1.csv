"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic first offer. Given that Bob faces a steeper inflation penalty (20% vs my 5%), he has more incentive to accept an early offer. However, I don't want to be too aggressive and risk rejection.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This gives me a solid majority while still leaving Bob with a significant sum. If he rejects this, his next round's money will be worth 20% less, while mine only 5% less, putting him at a disadvantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4300 
# Bob gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Due to inflation, if I accept:
   * My $4,300 is worth $4,085 (5% less)
   * Bob's $5,700 is worth $4,560 (20% less)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round my offer will face another 5% inflation for me
   * Bob's money will face another 20% inflation
   * I'll have control over the proposal

While the current offer gives me $4,085 in real value, I believe I can do better by making another proposal in the next round, especially since Bob faces much steeper inflation penalties. The inflation pressure on Bob is significant enough that I should have more leverage in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now that we're in round 3, let me consider the inflation effects:
- For me, money is worth 10% less than original value (two rounds of 5% inflation)
- For Bob, money is worth 40% less than original value (two rounds of 20% inflation)

Given Bob's severe inflation penalty, he should be more motivated to accept this offer rather than risk another round of 20% depreciation.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}

I propose I get $6,500 and Bob gets $3,500. Even though Bob's share seems smaller, considering his 40% inflation penalty, he should realize that rejecting this offer would lead to an even worse outcome for him in the next round. My offer of $3,500 is worth $2,100 to him now, but would be worth even less if he rejects and we go another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
   * My $4,700 at 14.26% inflation is worth about $4,030
   * Bob's $5,300 at 48.8% inflation is worth about $2,714

2. If I reject:
   * Next round will have even higher inflation (another 5% for me, 20% for Bob)
   * I'll get to make the offer, but the total value keeps decreasing

Bob's facing severe inflation at this point, and while I could reject and try to get more in the next round, the offer I'm getting ($4,030 in real value) is actually quite reasonable. The risk of further rounds decreasing the total value for both of us makes accepting now the more prudent choice.
