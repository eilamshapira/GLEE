"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing an even 50-50 split, which might seem fair at first glance. However, I need to account for the 10% inflation penalty I face each round.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value to me would be reduced by 10%. So I'd need to get more than 55.56% of the pot (more than $55.56) in the next round to beat the current $50 offer.

Given that Alice has no inflation penalty and might be reluctant to accept a significantly uneven split, the 50-50 offer actually seems reasonable.
