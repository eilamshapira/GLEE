"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself because every round the money loses 5% value for me, but not for you. This split is fair considering this disadvantage I have. If we go to another round, I'll lose value while you won't. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Considering your loss in value each round, I'm still willing to give you a significant share, but I believe I should have the larger portion since the value remains constant for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm reducing my request slightly to meet you closer to the middle. Due to the 10% cumulative inflation I've already experienced, this is actually worth less to me than my first offer. If we continue to the next round, I'll lose another 5% in value while you lose nothing. This offer is fair considering the asymmetric inflation that only affects me. 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, 
""alice_gain"": 42, 
""message"": ""I understand the impact of inflation on your share, but I've already given you a chance to accept a more generous offer. Given that the value remains constant for me, I'm adjusting the split to reflect my stronger bargaining position.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've moved closer to a 50/50 split to reach an agreement. Due to the nearly 20% cumulative inflation I'm experiencing, this $52 is actually worth only about $42 to me now compared to round 1 values. If we go another round, my position will worsen while yours remains unchanged. This offer is fair given the significant disadvantage inflation places on me. Let's conclude this now rather than letting more value erode. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""I acknowledge the significant impact of inflation on your share, but I've allowed multiple opportunities for you to accept a compromise. Given the substantial difference in value retention between us, I'm adjusting the split to reflect my increasingly favorable position.""}"
