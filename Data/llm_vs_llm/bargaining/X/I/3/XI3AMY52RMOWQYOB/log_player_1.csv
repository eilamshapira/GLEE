"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll send a fair and thoughtful offer to Bob considering the inflation penalty I face.

{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself because I face a 5% inflation penalty each round. If we delay, the total value decreases for me. This way we both walk away with a good deal right now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concern about inflation, Alice. But I am not affected by inflation. Let's meet in the middle, how about we split it equally? This way, neither of us feels disadvantaged. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58,
""bob_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to account for the inflation that only affects me. The money is now worth 10% less to me than in round 1. If we keep going back and forth, I'll lose more value with each round. This 58/42 split is fair considering my disadvantage - it compensates for the inflation I've already experienced and prevents further losses for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your situation, but I need to look out for my interests as well. I am not affected by inflation. Your proposal is not good for me. Let's split it so that I get a bit more this time, considering the impact of inflation on you. If we keep going, the value will keep decreasing for you, and we both might end up with less. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. We're now 5 rounds in, and I've lost almost 20% of my money's value due to inflation. Your offers are getting worse for me while you face no penalty. This 60/40 split fairly compensates for my current and future inflation losses. If we keep going, we'll both lose as my minimum acceptable amount will need to increase further to offset inflation. This is a reasonable compromise - please accept so we can both walk away with a good outcome.""}"
