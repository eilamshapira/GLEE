4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, since I'm not affected by inflation, I can be patient. However, I want to be fair. This 55-45 split is more equitable considering you face 20% inflation per round. If we keep going, your share will be worth less and less to you. This is a fair offer that recognizes both our positions.",Bob,2,
