"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I'm affected by 20% inflation each round, this is actually quite fair as delays will hurt me more than you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, since I'm not affected by inflation, I can be patient. However, I want to be fair. This 55-45 split is more equitable considering you face 20% inflation per round. If we keep going, your share will be worth less and less to you. This is a fair offer that recognizes both our positions. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
* If I accept now, I get $4500, but it's worth 20% less due to one round of inflation, so effectively $3600
* If I reject and make a counter-offer, even if Bob accepts immediately, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
* While I could try to negotiate for more, Bob is correct that my bargaining position weakens with each round due to inflation
* $3600 effective value is not ideal but still substantial, and further delay risks even worse outcomes
