"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I'm affected by 20% inflation each round, this is actually quite fair as delays will hurt me more than you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is correct that she's affected by 20% inflation per round while I'm not affected
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * Alice's value of money will be worth 20% less
   * I could propose a more favorable split
   * But Alice might reject, leading to further rounds
3. Current offer gives me $4000, which is 40% of the total
4. If this goes on for several rounds, Alice's share will be worth much less to her
5. However, this first offer seems a bit too favorable to Alice when I have inflation immunity

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer considering the inflation dynamics:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, since I'm not affected by inflation, I can be patient. However, I want to be fair. This 55-45 split is more equitable considering you face 20% inflation per round. If we keep going, your share will be worth less and less to you. This is a fair offer that recognizes both our positions.""}"
