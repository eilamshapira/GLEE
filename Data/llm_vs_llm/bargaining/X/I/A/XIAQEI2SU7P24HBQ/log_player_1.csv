Explanation for Bob: I propose to take $5,500 for myself and give you $4,500. This split considers the devaluation of money over rounds, which affects me less than it affects you. It's a fair starting point given the game's dynamics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
