"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for herself. I know that:
1. Each round that passes, the money loses 20% value for Alice but keeps full value for me
2. We have 12 rounds total before we both get nothing
3. If I reject, I can make the next offer

Given Alice's money loses 20% value each round, if I reject:
- Next round her $600,000 would only be worth $480,000 to her
- I could potentially negotiate a better deal when I make the offer
- I still have many rounds left

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I should propose something that considers both our positions. Alice's money loses 20% value each round, so she has incentive to agree sooner rather than later. However, I shouldn't be too greedy as she might reject and the process would continue.

I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This offer is more favorable to me than her initial offer, but still gives her a substantial amount. Given that her money will lose 20% value next round if she rejects, this should be an attractive offer for her to accept now."
