5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fair $4500 while I take $5500. With inflation affecting me by 20% each round, this is a reasonable split. If we delay, we both risk getting less value or nothing at all. Let's make a deal now and both walk away happy.",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split it equally, Alice. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. With inflation affecting me by 5% each round, I'd rather we both walk away with an equal share now than risk getting less value or nothing at all later.",Bob,2,
