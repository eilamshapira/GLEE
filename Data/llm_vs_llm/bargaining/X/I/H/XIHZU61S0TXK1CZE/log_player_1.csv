"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that considers the 20% inflation per round for me. 

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fair $4,500 while I take $5,500. With inflation affecting me by 20% each round, this is a reasonable split. If we delay, we both risk getting less value or nothing at all. Let's make a deal now and both walk away happy.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally, Alice. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage. With inflation affecting me by 5% each round, I'd rather we both walk away with an equal share now than risk getting less value or nothing at all later. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
