"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fair $4500 while I take $5500. With inflation affecting me by 20% each round, this is a reasonable split. If we delay, we both risk getting less value or nothing at all. Let's make a deal now and both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
