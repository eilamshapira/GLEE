5000.0,5000.0,I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. This way we can resolve this quickly before inflation affects both our shares significantly.,Bob,2,

4800.0,5200.0,"I notice your inflation rate is higher than mine, so time is pressuring you more. However, I'm still willing to be reasonable. This split gives you a substantial amount before inflation erodes our values further. Let's resolve this now to our mutual benefit.",Bob,4,

5600.0,4400.0,"I know my inflation rate is higher, but I'm not desperate yet. This is my most generous offer so far, let's settle",Alice,5,

4500.0,5500.0,"We're at round 6 of 12, and your inflation rate is significantly higher than mine. Your money is already worth 59% less while mine only 34% less. This trend will continue, making each round much costlier for you than for me. This is a fair offer considering our different positions - I suggest we conclude now before your share loses even more value.",Bob,6,
