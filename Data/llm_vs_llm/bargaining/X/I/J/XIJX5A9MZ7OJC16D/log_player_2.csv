"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split, let's be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of the 10,000$, which is 40% of the total amount. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but I'll face 10% inflation, meaning the money will be worth less to me.

Given that:
- This is just the first round
- We have 12 rounds total
- I'm facing 10% inflation per round
- I don't know Alice's inflation rate

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer to Alice, considering that we both face the time pressure.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split which is fair for both of us. This way we can resolve this quickly before inflation affects both our shares significantly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is now offering me 4200$ out of the 10,000$, which is 42% of the total. Due to inflation, money is now worth 19% less to me than in the first round.

I notice that Alice's inflation rate (36%) is significantly higher than mine (19%), which gives me some negotiating leverage as the rounds progress. She's slightly improved her offer from the first round, but we're still early in the game.

Given:
- This is round 3 of 12
- My inflation rate (19%) is lower than Alice's (36%)
- Alice has increased her offer to me slightly
- Alice seems willing to compromise

I think I can still get a better deal by making a counter-offer, especially since Alice's money is devaluing faster than mine.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Now that I know Alice's inflation rate is higher than mine, I can adjust my strategy accordingly.

{""bob_gain"": 5200, 
""alice_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""I notice your inflation rate is higher than mine, so time is pressuring you more. However, I'm still willing to be reasonable. This split gives you a substantial amount before inflation erodes our values further. Let's resolve this now to our mutual benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know my inflation rate is higher, but I'm not desperate yet. This is my most generous offer so far, let's settle 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this latest offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me 4400$ (44% of the total), which is her best offer yet. Her inflation rate is significantly higher than mine (59.04% vs 34.39%), and we're now in round 5 of 12.

Key considerations:
- We're approaching the middle of our negotiation window
- Alice's money is devaluing much faster than mine
- She's gradually increasing her offers (from 40% to 42% to now 44%)
- Her message indicates she recognizes her worse position but isn't ready to concede fully

Given that Alice's inflation rate is almost twice mine, waiting may benefit me more than her. If we continue this pattern, I might be able to secure an even better deal in later rounds as her effective value drops more rapidly.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll leverage the inflation difference more assertively now, as we're halfway through our negotiation window.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""We're at round 6 of 12, and your inflation rate is significantly higher than mine. Your money is already worth 59% less while mine only 34% less. This trend will continue, making each round much costlier for you than for me. This is a fair offer considering our different positions - I suggest we conclude now before your share loses even more value.""}"
