"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a solid offer. This division gives you a fair amount while I still secure a majority. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer in the context of our game. She's offering me $2,000 out of the $10,000, which is 20% of the total.

Given that:
1. There's an inflation penalty of 10% per round for me
2. I don't know how inflation affects Alice
3. We have a total of 12 rounds to reach agreement

While Alice's offer gives her the majority (80%), I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round. Even with 10% inflation, I should be able to propose a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the inflation risk we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'd prefer a more equal division. This 50-50 split is fair to both of us. Remember that with each round, inflation reduces the total value, so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement soon.""}"
