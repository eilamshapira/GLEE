60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob! I propose that I take $60 and you receive $40. Settling now avoids the impact of inflation on my share, so accepting quickly guarantees you a full $40, whereas waiting might shift the balance. I hope this fair offer meets your approval.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think an even 50-50 split is more fair for both of us. This gives us each $50, which is equitable. With inflation affecting my share by 5% each round, I have incentive to settle quickly, and I'm offering you the same value now rather than risking further delays that would reduce the total amount for both of us. I hope you'll agree this is a reasonable compromise.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for your fair proposal. Even accounting for the inflation effects, your offer gives me a clear, immediate outcome that avoids further devaluation in subsequent rounds. I agree to the 50-50 split.",Alice,2,accept
