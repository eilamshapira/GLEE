"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I propose that I take $60 and you receive $40. Settling now avoids the impact of inflation on my share, so accepting quickly guarantees you a full $40, whereas waiting might shift the balance. I hope this fair offer meets your approval.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think an even 50-50 split is more fair for both of us. This gives us each $50, which is equitable. With inflation affecting my share by 5% each round, I have incentive to settle quickly, and I'm offering you the same value now rather than risking further delays that would reduce the total amount for both of us. I hope you'll agree this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your fair proposal. Even accounting for the inflation effects, your offer gives me a clear, immediate outcome that avoids further devaluation in subsequent rounds. I agree to the 50-50 split.""}"
