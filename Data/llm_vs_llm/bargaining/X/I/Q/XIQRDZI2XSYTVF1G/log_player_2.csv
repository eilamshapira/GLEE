"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I propose that I take $60 and you receive $40. Settling now avoids the impact of inflation on my share, so accepting quickly guarantees you a full $40, whereas waiting might shift the balance. I hope this fair offer meets your approval. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer would give me $40 while she takes $60. Given that inflation will reduce the value of money by 5% each round, if I reject now and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will already be worth less. However, I believe we can reach a more equitable distribution.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that acknowledges the inflation risk.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think an even 50-50 split is more fair for both of us. This gives us each $50, which is equitable. With inflation affecting my share by 5% each round, I have incentive to settle quickly, and I'm offering you the same value now rather than risking further delays that would reduce the total amount for both of us. I hope you'll agree this is a reasonable compromise.""}"
