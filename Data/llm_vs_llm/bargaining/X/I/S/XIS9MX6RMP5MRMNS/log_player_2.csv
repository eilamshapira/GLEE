"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the $10,000, which is 40% of the total. While this isn't an even split, I need to consider that rejecting means we move to the next round where the total value decreases by 5% (to $9,500).

If I reject and propose a 50-50 split next round, I'd offer myself $4,750. That's only $750 more than what I'm being offered now, and Alice might reject that, leading to further rounds and more depreciation.

Given the inflation penalty and the reasonable nature of the current offer, I'll accept.
