"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. As Alice, I will make the first proposal. I need to balance getting a good amount for myself while also making it attractive enough for Bob to accept, considering the inflation factor.

Here's my proposal:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This gives me a slight advantage, but hopefully not so much that Bob rejects it outright, especially considering that the value of the money decreases each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's offer. Let's analyze this:

*   **Bob's Offer:** $5000 for me, $5000 for him.

*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 5% less, and Bob's is worth 10% less.

Even though the split is 50/50, I need to consider the inflation. Since Bob's money is losing value faster, he is probably more inclined to accept a deal now than later.

Let's think about the absolute value for me. 5000$ in round 2 equals to 5000 * 0.95 = 4750$ in round 1.

I'm going to accept the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
