4500.0,5500.0,"Since the money will be worth 10% less to you next round, this offer of $4500 now is better than getting $5000 in the next round. Let's make a deal now and both benefit.",Bob,2,

4000.0,6000.0,"The money is now worth 29% less to you in the next round if you reject. This $4000 now is worth more to you than $5000 in round 5. Let's conclude this now - you get real value, and we both avoid further devaluation risk.",Bob,4,
