"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the inflation affects me more. This offer gives you a good share while acknowledging my disadvantage. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $4,500 while taking $5,500. Her argument about inflation affecting her more is valid, but if I reject:
1. In the next round, I can make a proposal
2. Her share will be worth 10% less to her (so $5,500 now is better for her than a higher amount next round)
3. We still have plenty of rounds left

Since I can make the next offer and the inflation pressure is on her side, I believe I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for the inflation pressure on Alice while being more favorable to me.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Since the money will be worth 10% less to you next round, this offer of $4,500 now is better than getting $5,000 in the next round. Let's make a deal now and both benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally this time. Even though the money is worth less to me now, this is a fair division. Let's end the game here and both walk away with a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split ($5,000 each)
2. For her, the $5,000 is worth 19% less than in round 1
3. For me, the $5,000 is worth the same as in round 1
4. If I reject, we move to round 4, where I can make an offer, but her money will be worth even less to her
5. She's under more pressure to make a deal due to the inflation affecting her

While this is a fair nominal split, I can likely get a better deal since the inflation pressure gives me leverage. The fact that she moved from wanting $5,500 to accepting $5,000 shows the inflation is affecting her decision-making.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice has shown willingness to compromise and the inflation is increasingly pressuring her, I'll make a stronger offer in my favor but not too aggressive to ensure acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""The money is now worth 29% less to you in the next round if you reject. This $4,000 now is worth more to you than $5,000 in round 5. Let's conclude this now - you get real value, and we both avoid further devaluation risk.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a bit less to accommodate your perspective, but let's be fair considering my inflation disadvantage. This offer ensures we both get a reasonable share. 
# Bob gain: 5400 
# Alice gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $5,400 (better than her previous offers)
2. She'd get $4,600, but it's worth 34.39% less to her than in round 1
3. For me, $5,400 is still worth full value
4. The inflation effect is becoming quite significant for her
5. We're in round 5 of 12, so there's still time, but the pressure is building

Given that:
- Alice is clearly feeling the pressure (she's now offering me more than before)
- Her money is losing value rapidly
- I can make an even stronger offer next round
- We still have rounds left

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice is showing increasing willingness to accept less (now down to $4,600), and her money will be worth about 44% less next round, I'll push for a stronger position while still leaving her enough incentive to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Consider this carefully: Due to your 44% inflation next round, this $3,500 now is worth more to you than $4,600 would be in the next round. Further delays will only reduce your real value more significantly. This is a better deal for you than waiting.""}"
