"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, to avoid further erosion of value on my end (and hopefully yours, though I'm not sure about your inflation), I propose an even split. Let's agree now and secure our shares before any more value is lost. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
