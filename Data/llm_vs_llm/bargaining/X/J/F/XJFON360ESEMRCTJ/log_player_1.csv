Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as you know, every round of delay costs me 5% of my share—while I’m not sure how time affects your end, I’d like us to settle immediately. I'm offering you nearly the full pot so you can secure almost all of its value right now. Let's avoid any further losses and conclude this deal. 
# Alice gain: 990000 
# Bob gain: 10000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
