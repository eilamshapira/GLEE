"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair and strategic initial proposal to Bob, considering the inflation factor that affects me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me since I face 5% inflation per round. If we delay, the total value decreases for me. This is a reasonable first offer that lets us both walk away with substantial amounts.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was tempting, but let's be realistic. The inflation hits me harder, so I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. How about we flip the script and see how you like those numbers? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
