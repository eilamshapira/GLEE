"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me since I face 5% inflation per round. If we delay, the total value decreases for me. This is a reasonable first offer that lets us both walk away with substantial amounts. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
