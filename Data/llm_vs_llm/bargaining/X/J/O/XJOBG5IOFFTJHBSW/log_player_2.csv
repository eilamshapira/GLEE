"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer: I (Bob) would get $40, and Alice would get $60. 

If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer. However, the money would be worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice in the next round. That means the $100 would effectively be worth $95 to me and $90 to Alice.

If I make a counter-offer, I could potentially get more than $40, but we'd be dividing a ""smaller pie"" in terms of value. Since Alice is experiencing more severe inflation (10%), she might be more willing to accept a reasonable counter-offer in the next round.

I think I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counter-offer that takes into account our different inflation rates.

Since Alice experiences higher inflation (10% vs my 5%), she has more incentive to agree to a deal sooner. However, I still want to propose something fair that she's likely to accept.

Given that the $100 is now worth $95 to me and $90 to Alice, I'll propose a more balanced split that slightly favors me but isn't too aggressive.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider this new offer from Alice.

Alice is now offering me $45, which is an improvement from her first offer of $40. Due to inflation, the money is now worth 9.75% less to me than in round 1, meaning this $45 is equivalent to about $40.61 in round 1 value.

If I reject and we go to round 4, my inflation will increase further (to roughly 14.75%), and Alice's inflation will increase even more (to roughly 29%). The further we go, the smaller the total ""pie"" becomes in terms of real value.

Alice has moved significantly from her initial position, and this offer gives me almost half of the money. Given the diminishing returns of continuing negotiations, I think this is a reasonable compromise.
