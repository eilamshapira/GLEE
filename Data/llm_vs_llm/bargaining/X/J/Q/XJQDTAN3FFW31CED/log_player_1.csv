"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering I need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept, while accounting for the 20% inflation risk if we move to the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

A 50-50 split is fair and reasonable for both parties. If Bob rejects this and we move to the next round, my potential gain would be worth 20% less due to inflation, so this is a strong initial offer."
