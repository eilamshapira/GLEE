"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both need to agree quickly due to inflation affecting our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose an even 50-50 split. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm comfortable negotiating for a fair division. A 50-50 split is the most equitable solution and would allow us both to walk away with a significant amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I should accept this offer because:
1. With 20% inflation, my $5000 is effectively worth $4000
2. If I reject and we continue to later rounds, inflation will reduce my share even more
3. A 50-50 split is objectively fair, and getting $4000 in real value is still better than risking further devaluation
4. Bob has revealed he's not affected by inflation, giving him a stronger negotiating position in later rounds"
