"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both need to agree quickly due to inflation affecting our gains. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this 60-40 split in Alice's favor is a good deal for me. Since there's no inflation affecting me (0% less each round), I don't lose value by continuing to negotiate. I could potentially get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I propose an even 50-50 split. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm comfortable negotiating for a fair division. A 50-50 split is the most equitable solution and would allow us both to walk away with a significant amount.""}"
