"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I think we can do better. A 50/50 split is truly fair, and I believe we can both walk away satisfied with this division. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
