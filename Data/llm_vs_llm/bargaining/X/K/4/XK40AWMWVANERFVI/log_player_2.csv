"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Bob. I need to consider the inflation and limited rounds.

Round 1: Alice offers me $40, and she gets $60.

Let's consider a few things:

*   **Inflation:** If I reject, the money's worth will decrease by 5% for me.
*   **Rounds remaining:** I have 11 rounds left if I reject.
*   **Alternatives:** If I reject, there is no guarantee that next round I will get more than 40*(100% -5%) = 38

Given the high starting amount and the uncertainty of future offers considering the effect of the inflation, I am going to accept the offer.
