"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

For Round 1, Alice is offering me $45 while taking $55.
- If I reject, we move to Round 2 where I can make an offer
- However, for me, the money will be worth 20% less next round
- $45 now is better than having $50 worth 20% less ($40) next round

While the split isn't perfectly equal, it's a reasonable first offer. Getting $45 now is better than risking further devaluation of the money in later rounds, especially since my inflation rate is higher than Alice's.
