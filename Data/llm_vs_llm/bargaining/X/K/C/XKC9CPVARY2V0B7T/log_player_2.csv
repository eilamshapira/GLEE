"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money 60 for me and 40 for you. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
- If I reject and move to next round, the money will be worth 20% less for me
- In round 2, $40 would only be worth $32 for me
- Even if I propose a better split in round 2, Alice might reject it
- We only have 12 rounds total and each rejection makes the pot worth less

While 40-60 isn't an even split, it's a reasonable first offer and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky.
