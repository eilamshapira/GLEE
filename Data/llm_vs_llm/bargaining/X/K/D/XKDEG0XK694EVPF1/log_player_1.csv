"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that considers the inflation penalty I face if we delay agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 530000, ""bob_gain"": 470000}

I'm proposing a split where I get $530,000 and you (Bob) get $470,000. This is slightly in my favor to account for the 5% inflation penalty I'll face if we go to another round. I believe this is fair since we both want to maximize our gains, and delaying hurts my position more than yours."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because Bob is taking advantage of my inflation penalty. Even with the 5% penalty, I can still get a better outcome in the next round than accepting just $400,000. Let me counter with a more reasonable proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 510000, ""bob_gain"": 490000}

I'm proposing a more balanced split where I get $510,000 and you get $490,000. This accounts for the continuing inflation pressure I face while still being fair to both of us. If we continue to the next round, I'll face another 5% inflation penalty, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now. This offer gives you a substantial portion while allowing me to compensate for my weaker negotiating position due to the inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer. Bob's offer of $350,000 to me is too low, even considering the 14.26% inflation penalty I now face. Bob seems to be strategically exploiting the inflation pressure on me by reducing his offers over time rather than working toward a fair agreement. I'll make a more reasonable counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000}

I'm proposing a split where I get $480,000 and you get $520,000. This recognizes that my bargaining position is weakening due to the increasing inflation penalty, now at nearly 20% if we go another round. This offer gives you a majority of the money while still allowing me to receive a reasonable amount. I believe this is fair and should be acceptable to both of us. Further delays will only reduce the total value I can receive, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement now."
