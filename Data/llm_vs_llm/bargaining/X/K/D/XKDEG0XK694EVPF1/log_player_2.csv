"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Alice, I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that Alice's gain is worth 9.75% less, I think I can get a better deal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is still worth the same for me, but Alice's share is now worth 14.75% less (5% in round 2 + 9.75% in round 3, which is a cumulative 5% + 5% * 0.95 = 9.75%, and 5% + 9.75% = 14.75%) due to inflation, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 650000, 
""alice_gain"": 350000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that Alice's gain is now worth 18.55% less, this offer seems more reasonable. Since Alice's share is decreasing in value, she might be more willing to accept a less favorable split in the future, but this offer is still relatively close to a 50/50 split in nominal terms.
