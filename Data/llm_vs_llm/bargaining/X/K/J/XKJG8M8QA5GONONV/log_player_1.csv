"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a more equitable split. I propose 55/45. This is fair, and we can secure a good deal for both of us before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
