"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer next round
3. The money will be worth 20% less for me next round, so my $5000 would effectively become $4000
4. I don't know how inflation affects Alice, so there's some uncertainty
5. We have plenty of rounds left, but waiting too long is risky

Given that it's a fair first offer and the inflation penalty is significant, I'll accept this offer. Getting $5000 now is better than risking a lower effective amount in future rounds.
