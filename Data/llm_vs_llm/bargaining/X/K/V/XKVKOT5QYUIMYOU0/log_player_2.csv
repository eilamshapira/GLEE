"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice has offered me $100,000 out of the $1,000,000 total, which is only 10% of the pot. Given that I have inflation at 20% per round, if I reject now, my next offer would be dealing with money worth 80% of the original value. However, I can make a counter-offer in the next round that could be more favorable to me.

$100,000 is too low a share, especially when I'm dealing with inflation. I'll reject this and make a counter-offer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a more balanced proposal. Given that I face 20% inflation per round, I need to make a reasonable offer that Alice might accept, as waiting too long will significantly reduce the money's value for me.

I'll propose a more equitable split, but still in my favor since I'm affected by inflation:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

This gives me a fair majority while still leaving Alice with a substantial amount. It's much more balanced than her initial 90-10 split, and given the inflation pressure on my side, it's important to reach an agreement soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Alice has improved her offer from $100K to $300K for me
2. Due to inflation, $300K is now actually worth $192K for me (64% of original value)
3. If I reject, the next round will have even more inflation impact
4. Alice's inflation rate is lower than mine (19% vs 36%), which explains why she might be more patient
5. We've already used 3 rounds out of 12, and the gap in our inflation rates means my negotiating position weakens faster than hers

While I'd prefer a better split, the increasing inflation rate on my side puts me at a disadvantage in later rounds. Given that Alice has shown willingness to improve her offer substantially, but also seems prepared to wait (due to her lower inflation rate), accepting this offer now might be the most rational choice.
