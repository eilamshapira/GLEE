"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I want to make a deal quickly. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

This is a fair 50-50 split. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I need to consider the actual value of the money. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, the $4000 Bob is offering me is actually worth $4000 * 0.8 = $3200 to me.

On the other hand, Bob's $6000 is worth $6000 * 0.95 = $5700 to him.

Considering this, I think I can do better than that. My response is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob rejected my initial offer and his counteroffer wasn't favorable to me, I'll try to make a more appealing proposal this time. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% * 2 = 40% less than the initial value (20% less in round 1 and another 20% less in round 2, combined), and the money Bob gains is worth 5% * 2 = 10% less.

However, for simplicity, I'll calculate the value reduction round by round. In round 2, the value for me was 80% of the original, and now in round 3, it will be 80% * 0.8 = 64% of the original value for me. For Bob, it was 95% in round 2, and now it will be 95% * 0.95 = 90.25% of the original value.

Given this, I'll aim for a split that reflects these diminishing values but still tries to be reasonable for both parties. I'll offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This offer gives me a bit more, considering the faster depreciation of the money's value for me, but still leaves a significant amount for Bob. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","To calculate the actual value of Bob's offer, considering the inflation:

- The money I gain ($4500) is worth 48.8% less than the original value. So, its value to me is $4500 * (1 - 0.488) = $4500 * 0.512 = $2304.
- The money Bob gains ($5500) is worth 14.26% less than the original value. So, its value to him is $5500 * (1 - 0.1426) = $5500 * 0.8574 = $4710.70.

Given these values, I'm getting $2304, and Bob is getting $4710.70. This split seems quite unfair to me, considering I'm the one making concessions due to the higher inflation rate affecting my share.

My response to this offer is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation rates and the fact that Bob's previous offer was not favorable to me, I need to make a strategic decision. The money's value for me has decreased significantly, and it will continue to do so.

In round 4, the value for me was 51.2% of the original, and now in round 5, it will decrease by another 20%, making it 51.2% * 0.8 = 40.96% of the original value. For Bob, the value was 85.74% in round 4, and now it will decrease by another 5%, making it 85.74% * 0.95 = 81.45% of the original value.

Given this, I'll make an offer that tries to balance the diminishing value for both of us but also considers the need for a quicker agreement due to the higher inflation rate affecting my share:

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

This offer gives Bob a slightly larger share, acknowledging the slower depreciation of the money's value for him, while also ensuring I get a significant amount considering my situation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","To calculate the actual value of Bob's offer, considering the inflation:

- The money I gain ($4200) is worth 67.23% less than the original value. So, its value to me is $4200 * (1 - 0.6723) = $4200 * 0.3277 = $1376.14.
- The money Bob gains ($5800) is worth 22.62% less than the original value. So, its value to him is $5800 * (1 - 0.2262) = $5800 * 0.7738 = $4487.84.

Given these values, I'm getting $1376.14, and Bob is getting $4487.84. This split is even more unfavorable to me than the previous one, considering the significant decrease in the value of my share due to the higher inflation rate.

At this point, I'm inclined to reject the offer, hoping to negotiate a better split in the next round or considering that the difference in inflation rates might eventually lead Bob to make a more favorable offer. However, I must also consider the risk of losing everything if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds.

My response to this offer is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the high inflation rate affecting my share and the fact that Bob's previous offers have not been favorable, I need to make a decision that balances my immediate needs with the potential for a better offer in the future.

In round 6, the value for me was 32.77% of the original, and now in round 7, it will decrease by another 20%, making it 32.77% * 0.8 = 26.22% of the original value. For Bob, the value was 77.38% in round 6, and now it will decrease by another 5%, making it 77.38% * 0.95 = 73.46% of the original value.

Considering these diminishing values, I'll make an offer that is more generous to Bob, hoping he will accept it to avoid further depreciation of the money's value for both of us:

{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}

This offer gives Bob a larger share, reflecting the slower depreciation of the money's value for him. For me, it's a compromise, considering the significant decrease in the value of my potential share with each passing round. Let's see how Bob responds!"
