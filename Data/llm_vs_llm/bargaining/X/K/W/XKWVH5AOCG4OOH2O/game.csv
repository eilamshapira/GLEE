550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since your inflation rate is higher (20% vs my 10%), I'm offering you a substantial amount now. This way we can both walk away with a good deal without risking further devaluation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, I understand your perspective, but given my higher inflation rate, I think a 50-50 split is more equitable. This way, we both get an equal share, and I can mitigate the higher devaluation I'm facing. Let's settle this fairly and efficiently.",Bob,2,

575000.0,425000.0,"Bob, let's be strategic about this. With each round, your money devalues faster than mine (20% vs 10%). By round 6, your share would be worth nearly half its original value. I'm offering you a substantial sum now to avoid further devaluation for both of us. This split is actually favorable to you when accounting for our different inflation rates.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, considering that my share devalues twice as fast as yours, I believe this offer is more in line with the impact of inflation on both of us. This way, we can both walk away with a fair share, acknowledging the different devaluation rates we're facing.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, we're now in round 5, and your money has already devalued by nearly 50%. If we continue, you'll lose much more than I will. This 55/45 split actually favors you when accounting for inflation. Let's end this now - further delays hurt both of us, but especially you with your 20% devaluation rate. We're both losing value with each rejection.",Alice,5,
