Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since your inflation rate is higher (20% vs my 10%), I'm offering you a substantial amount now. This way we can both walk away with a good deal without risking further devaluation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but given my higher inflation rate, I think a 50-50 split is more equitable. This way, we both get an equal share, and I can mitigate the higher devaluation I'm facing. Let's settle this fairly and efficiently.

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 575000, ""bob_gain"": 425000, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be strategic about this. With each round, your money devalues faster than mine (20% vs 10%). By round 6, your share would be worth nearly half its original value. I'm offering you a substantial sum now to avoid further devaluation for both of us. This split is actually favorable to you when accounting for our different inflation rates.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering that my share devalues twice as fast as yours, I believe this offer is more in line with the impact of inflation on both of us. This way, we can both walk away with a fair share, acknowledging the different devaluation rates we're facing.

If we continue, you'll lose much more than I will. This 55/45 split actually favors you when accounting for inflation. Let's end this now - further delays hurt both of us, but especially you with your 20% devaluation rate. We're both losing value with each rejection.""}"
