"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since your inflation rate is higher (20% vs my 10%), I'm offering you a substantial amount now. This way we can both walk away with a good deal without risking further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Message to Alice:
Hi Alice, I appreciate your consideration of the inflation rates. However, given that the money devalues faster for me, I think it's fair to ask for a bit more to compensate for the higher inflation rate I'm facing. Let's find a middle ground that acknowledges this discrepancy."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but given my higher inflation rate, I think a 50-50 split is more equitable. This way, we both get an equal share, and I can mitigate the higher devaluation I'm facing. Let's settle this fairly and efficiently.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be strategic about this. With each round, your money devalues faster than mine (20% vs 10%). By round 6, your share would be worth nearly half its original value. I'm offering you a substantial sum now to avoid further devaluation for both of us. This split is actually favorable to you when accounting for our different inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Message to Alice:
Alice, I see your point, but I think your offer doesn't fully account for the faster devaluation I'm facing. Let's find a compromise that better reflects the impact of inflation on both of us. I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe a more balanced approach is needed."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, considering that my share devalues twice as fast as yours, I believe this offer is more in line with the impact of inflation on both of us. This way, we can both walk away with a fair share, acknowledging the different devaluation rates we're facing.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're now in round 5, and your money has already devalued by nearly 50%. If we continue, you'll lose much more than I will. This 55/45 split actually favors you when accounting for inflation. Let's end this now - further delays hurt both of us, but especially you with your 20% devaluation rate. We're both losing value with each rejection. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

# Message to Alice:
Alice, I accept your offer. You're right that further delays will only hurt both of us more, with my share devaluing faster. Let's end this now and walk away with a fair deal."
