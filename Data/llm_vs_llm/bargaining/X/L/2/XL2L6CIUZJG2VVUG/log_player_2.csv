"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it so we both gain fairly considering the inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4,500 out of $10,000
2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   - My money will be worth 5% less
   - Alice's money will be worth 20% less
   - I'll get to make the next offer
3. 5% of $10,000 is $500, so next round the total value to me would be $9,500
4. I could potentially get more in the next round, but there's also risk Alice rejects

The current offer gives me $4,500 right now, which is a decent amount considering I don't have to risk inflation. While it's not quite 50-50, given the different inflation rates affecting us, it's a reasonable offer.
