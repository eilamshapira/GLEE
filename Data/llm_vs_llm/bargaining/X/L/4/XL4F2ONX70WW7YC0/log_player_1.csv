"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. This is a fair split considering the inflation rates. You'll get $400000 now, which is better than a larger share of a depreciated sum later. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
