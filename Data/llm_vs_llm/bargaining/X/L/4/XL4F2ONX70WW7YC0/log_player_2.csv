"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take the lion's share, but let's be fair.  You get a good chunk too.  Accept this offer and we're done. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $100,000 out of the $1,000,000.

Given that:
1. Money loses 5% value for me and 10% value for Alice each round
2. I'll get to make the next offer if I reject
3. The current offer gives me only 10% of the total

This offer is too low. With the inflation rates working in my favor (I lose less value per round than Alice), I can likely negotiate a better deal. Even after one round, I would still be better off getting a larger share of the slightly depreciated amount.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected, let me make a more balanced offer. Given that Alice loses 10% value per round compared to my 5%, she has more incentive to accept a fair deal now rather than drag this out. I'll propose a more equitable split while still giving myself the larger share.

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. This is a fair split considering the inflation rates. You'll get $400,000 now, which is better than a larger share of a depreciated sum later.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share than this.  Let's split it closer to 55/45. This is a fair deal given the inflation we've already seen. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $450,000 (45%) of the money
2. Due to inflation, this is actually worth $406,125 to me (450000 * 0.9025)
3. If I reject, we go to round 4, where:
   - I can make an offer
   - But my money will be worth 14.75% less
   - Alice's money will be worth 29% less
   - This significantly reduces the real value of any future deal

This is actually a reasonable offer:
- It's much better than the initial 90/10 split
- The inflation is already eating into our gains
- Further negotiation might lead to diminishing returns for both of us
- 45/55 split is fairly balanced
