"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, we both get the same amount, and we can avoid any further inflation effects. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now:
   * I get $5000, but with 20% inflation = $4000 effective value
   * Bob gets $5000, with 10% inflation = $4500 effective value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer, but my share will be worth even less (40% less than original)
   * There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer
   * We risk further rounds of inflation

Given that:
- The difference between our effective gains isn't too large ($4000 vs $4500)
- Further delays will hurt my position more than Bob's
- We need to reach an agreement within limited rounds
- This is a reasonable offer
