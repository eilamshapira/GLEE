"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair considering we both need to reach an agreement, and time pressure affects me more than you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in your favor. This is still fair and accounts for the time pressure you face. Let's reach an agreement! 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
* In this round, my $5500 is worth 5% less due to inflation, so it's effectively worth $5225
* If I reject and we go to the next round, any amount will be worth another 5% less
* Bob's offer is reasonable, giving me the majority while accounting for the inflation pressure
* Further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes due to continued inflation
