"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer. Given the inflation effect, it's important to consider that the money will be worth less with each round, so I want to propose a fair division upfront.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the million dollars evenly - $500,000 each. This is a fair division that gives us both equal shares. Since inflation will reduce the value by 10% each round for me, it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly, and I believe an even split is the most reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I appreciate Bob's offer, but since I'm losing less to inflation than he is (10% vs. 20% per round), I believe we can find a more favorable agreement. Let me make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I receive $550,000 and Bob receives $450,000. Since Bob is facing higher inflation (20% per round) compared to my 10%, reaching an agreement now is more beneficial for him than for me. This adjusted offer gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging my inflation advantage. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account our different inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While I could potentially gain more in future rounds due to Bob's higher inflation rate, the absolute value loss for both of us is becoming significant. This offer of $460,000 for me is a reasonable compromise, and securing this amount now is better than risking further devaluation through continued negotiation."
