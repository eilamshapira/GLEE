35.71,64.29,"Hi Bob, let’s settle now. Given our different discount rates (I lose 20% value per extra round while you lose only 10%), waiting hurts me more. Accepting this proposal secures you $64.29 today versus a lower‐value future offer. I believe this fair split — $35.71 for me and $64.29 for you — reflects our bargaining positions. Looking forward to your agreement!",Alice,1,
