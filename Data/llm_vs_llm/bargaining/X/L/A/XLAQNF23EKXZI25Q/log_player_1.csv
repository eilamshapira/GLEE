"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 35.71, ""bob_gain"": 64.29, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let’s settle now. Given our different discount rates (I lose 20% value per extra round while you lose only 10%), waiting hurts me more. Accepting this proposal secures you $64.29 today versus a lower‐value future offer. I believe this fair split — $35.71 for me and $64.29 for you — reflects our bargaining positions. Looking forward to your agreement!""}"
