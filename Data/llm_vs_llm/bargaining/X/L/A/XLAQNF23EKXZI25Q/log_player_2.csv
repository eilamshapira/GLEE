"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let’s settle now. Given our different discount rates (I lose 20% value per extra round while you lose only 10%), waiting hurts me more. Accepting this proposal secures you $64.29 today versus a lower‐value future offer. I believe this fair split — $35.71 for me and $64.29 for you — reflects our bargaining positions. Looking forward to your agreement! 
# Bob gain: 64.29 
# Alice gain: 35.71 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, let's analyze the situation considering the discount rates for both of us.

In the first round, Alice offers me $64.29 and takes $35.71 for herself. Given the discount rates, if I were to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, the total amount of money would be reduced.

For me, the money is worth 10% less with each passing round, and for Alice, it's 20% less. 

Let's calculate what would happen if I reject this offer and we move to the next round:

Original amount = $100
My discount rate = 10%
Alice's discount rate = 20%

After the first round (if I reject the offer):
- The amount for me would be 100 * 0.9 = $90 (since it's worth 10% less)
- The amount for Alice would be 100 * 0.8 = $80 (since it's worth 20% less)

However, these calculations are from the perspective of our individual losses. The actual pool of money we're dividing doesn't change in value due to our personal discount rates; rather, our perception of its value does. So, if we proceed, the total amount we divide remains $100, but its value to each of us decreases.

Given Alice's offer of $64.29 to me and $35.71 to her, and considering the discount rates, I need to think about whether waiting could potentially give me a better deal or if Alice's offer is reasonable given our positions.

Since Alice loses value at a higher rate than I do, she has an incentive to settle sooner rather than later. Her offer reflects this, giving me a larger share. 

Considering this, and without knowing exactly how Alice will behave in future rounds or what offers she might make, her current offer seems reasonable. It gives me a significant portion of the money, and given the uncertainty of future negotiations and the decreasing value of money over time, I think it's a good idea to accept this offer now rather than risking potentially lower-value future offers.
