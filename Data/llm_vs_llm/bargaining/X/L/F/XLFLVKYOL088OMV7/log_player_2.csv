"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I propose you take $6000 and I'll take $4000. Since the money devalues quite a bit for you in subsequent rounds, this initial offer ensures you receive the most value. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I take $6,000 and she gets $4,000.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, meaning each dollar would only be worth $0.80 to me. For Alice, each dollar would be worth $0.95.

If I make a counter-offer in round 2, the total value to me would be at most $8,000 (if I asked for the full amount), but that would only be worth $8,000 Ã— 0.8 = $6,400 to me. Alice would likely reject such an extreme offer anyway.

Alice's current offer of $6,000 is fairly generous, as it gives me 60% of the total. Given the significant inflation penalty I face, accepting now is better than risking a second round.
