"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep it simple and fair by splitting the money equally at $50 each. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. With a 20% inflation penalty per round, waiting will reduce my potential gains. The current offer of $50 is fair and would give me the maximum possible value without any inflation penalty.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, even if I ask for more, the 20% inflation means I'd need to get at least $62.50 just to break even with the current $50 offer (since $62.50 * 0.8 = $50).

Given this, accepting the equal split now is the most rational choice.
