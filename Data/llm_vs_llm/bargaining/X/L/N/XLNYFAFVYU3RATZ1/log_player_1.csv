"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle in the first round. I'll take $6000 and you'll receive $4000. Accepting now means both of us get the full value—avoiding any future discount. Let’s make this fair and efficient for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split it evenly with $5000 each. This way, we both benefit equally and don't have to worry about any further reduction in value. Fair for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
