50.0,50.0,"I propose a truly fair 50-50 split. Since you face 20% inflation per round and I don't, this is actually beneficial for you to accept now rather than continue negotiating.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,Meet in the middle of my first offer and your 50-50 proposal,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"With each round, the inflation reduces your effective gain by 20%. If we go to round 5, your 58 would be worth less than my current offer of 45. This offer is mathematically in your favor compared to further delays.",Bob,4,

55.0,45.0,Trying to find a mutually acceptable middle ground before inflation devalues my share further,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"Due to the 59% inflation you've already experienced, your effective value is significantly diminished. If we reach round 7, your 55 would be worth only about 22. My offer of 40 now is worth more to you than continuing, and we're running out of rounds.",Bob,6,
