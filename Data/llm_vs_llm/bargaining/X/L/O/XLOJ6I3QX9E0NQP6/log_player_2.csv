"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice suggests it's a fair share, I notice she's giving herself more than half of the money. Given that she faces a 20% inflation penalty per round while I don't lose value, I have some leverage in negotiations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I propose a truly fair 50-50 split. Since you face 20% inflation per round and I don't, this is actually beneficial for you to accept now rather than continue negotiating.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of my first offer and your 50-50 proposal 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is still requesting more than half despite facing increasing inflation penalties. Given the inflation effect on her value, it makes strategic sense for me to continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""With each round, the inflation reduces your effective gain by 20%. If we go to round 5, your 58 would be worth less than my current offer of 45. This offer is mathematically in your favor compared to further delays.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Trying to find a mutually acceptable middle ground before inflation devalues my share further 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is still offering me less than half despite the significant inflation she faces. The inflation penalty is now almost 60% for her, which gives me more leverage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Due to the 59% inflation you've already experienced, your effective value is significantly diminished. If we reach round 7, your 55 would be worth only about 22. My offer of 40 now is worth more to you than continuing, and we're running out of rounds.""}"
