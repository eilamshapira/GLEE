"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but this is more reasonable given the inflation. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the actual value of the offer.

The original value of $5500 is now worth $5500 * 0.8 = $4400 to me, due to the 20% inflation.

Considering this, I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less to me now (20% less each round), and Bob's offer in the previous round didn't account for the inflation from my perspective, I'll make a new offer.

The original $10,000 is now worth $10,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $6400 to me, and $10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $8100 to Bob.

Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Considering inflation, I need a larger share to make it fair""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a serious offer.  We both lose out the longer this goes on.  Meet me in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of the offer considering the inflation.

The original value of $5200 is now worth $5200 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $2654.40 to me, due to the 20% inflation each round.

On the other hand, if I were to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, the value of the money would decrease even further.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is reasonable, and meeting in the middle might be the best option at this point.
