55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob! Since we both lose money each round due to inflation (5% for me, 20% for you), it's best we agree quickly. I'm offering you 45% which is fair considering you face higher inflation. If we keep negotiating, your share becomes worth much less due to the 20% inflation rate you face.",Alice,1,
