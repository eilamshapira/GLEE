"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The current offer is 50$ for me and 50$ for Alice
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * My money will be worth 10% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 20% less
   * Alice might reject my offer, leading to further losses

Since it's a fair split and any delay will reduce the total value for both of us, this is actually a good offer. If I reject, even if I try to get more in the next round, the declining value due to inflation makes it risky.
