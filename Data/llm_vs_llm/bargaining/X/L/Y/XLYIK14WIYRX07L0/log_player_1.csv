Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think an equal 50-50 split is the fairest starting point. We both face inflation with each round, and this way we can both walk away with a good outcome without further devaluation of our shares. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
