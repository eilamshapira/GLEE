"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $4000 while she gets $6000, which isn't an even split. Given that inflation affects her more severely (20% per round vs my 10%), she may be accounting for that in her uneven proposal.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total pot will be worth less to both of us. For me, the $10,000 will be worth $9,000 next round, and for Alice it will be worth only $8,000.

While I could try to negotiate for a more equal split, I need to be mindful that we only have 12 rounds and each rejection costs us both. The offer isn't terrible considering the inflation factors.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's first offer, I should propose something that acknowledges both our concerns about inflation while being more balanced. I need to make an offer that's reasonable enough for Alice to accept given her higher inflation rate.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think an equal 50-50 split is the fairest starting point. We both face inflation with each round, and this way we can both walk away with a good outcome without further devaluation of our shares.""}"
