600000.0,400000.0,"I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Given that you face 10% depreciation each round while I don't, this is a fair offer that gives you $400000 right now instead of less valuable money later.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I understand the disadvantage I'm at, but your initial offer was far too skewed.  This is a more reasonable starting point for negotiation, recognizing that waiting does cost me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Consider this carefully, Bob. Due to the 20% depreciation you now face, your $450000 from this offer is actually worth more than what you'd get from a larger nominal amount in future rounds. This is a fair offer given the circumstances.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, this is a negotiation, and we need to find a compromise. I'm willing to absorb some of the inflation hit, but your offers haven't budged.  Let's be reasonable.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, let's be practical. With 30% depreciation, a smaller amount now is worth more to you than a larger amount later. This $400000 now is worth more than $520000 in future rounds due to your increasing depreciation. If we keep going, your position will only weaken. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, let's stop wasting time. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is the fairest deal and ensures we both benefit.  Take it or leave it - my offer won't change.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, your 50/50 split wasn't actually equal due to your depreciation. This offer of $350000 now is worth more to you than $500000 would be in future rounds due to your 44% depreciation. We're past the halfway point in rounds, and your position will continue to weaken. This is actually a fair offer in real value terms, and I suggest you take it.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, I'm sticking to my 50/50 split.  This is non-negotiable. Time is running out, and this ensures we both walk away with something instead of nothing.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, we only have 3 rounds left after this one. Your $500000 offer is worth less than $240000 to you now due to depreciation. This offer of $300000 now is actually worth more to you than waiting for future rounds where you'll face even higher depreciation. If we don't reach an agreement soon, we both get nothing. Think carefully about the real value you're getting, not just the nominal amount.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, this is my final offer.  It's a slight concession, but it's the best I can do with the time remaining.  Take it or leave it - our choice is now between some money or no money at all.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, this is our second-to-last chance. If we don't agree now or in the next round, we both get nothing. Your last offer of $450000 would only be worth about $174000 to you due to depreciation. This offer of $350000 now is better than what you'd get in real terms next round, and certainly better than getting nothing. We're both better off reaching an agreement now. Please accept this reasonable offer.",Alice,11,
