"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Let me think strategically. Since Bob faces a 10% loss in value each round, while I don't, I have some leverage. However, I should still make a reasonable first offer to encourage acceptance.

{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Given that you face 10% depreciation each round while I don't, this is a fair offer that gives you $400,000 right now instead of less valuable money later.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the disadvantage I'm at, but your initial offer was far too skewed.  This is a more reasonable starting point for negotiation, recognizing that waiting does cost me. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob is offering me $450,000 and keeping $550,000
2. If I reject, we move to round 3 where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth 20% less than round 1
   - My money maintains its value
3. Bob's current $550,000 would be worth $495,000 to him next round
4. This suggests I might get a better deal by rejecting

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's money is now worth 20% less, I can leverage this but still need to be reasonable to avoid too many rounds.

{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Consider this carefully, Bob. Due to the 20% depreciation you now face, your $450,000 from this offer is actually worth more than what you'd get from a larger nominal amount in future rounds. This is a fair offer given the circumstances.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a negotiation, and we need to find a compromise. I'm willing to absorb some of the inflation hit, but your offers haven't budged.  Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob is offering me $480,000 and keeping $520,000
2. His $520,000 is actually worth only about $379,080 to him due to 27.1% depreciation
3. If I reject:
   - Next round will have ~30% depreciation for Bob
   - I can make another offer
   - I maintain full value
4. Since Bob's negotiation position is weakening and he's not offering a significantly better deal, it's strategic to reject

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With Bob now facing 30% depreciation, I should increase my offer but remain strategic.

{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. With 30% depreciation, a smaller amount now is worth more to you than a larger amount later. This $400,000 now is worth more than $520,000 in future rounds due to your increasing depreciation. If we keep going, your position will only weaken. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is the fairest deal and ensures we both benefit.  Take it or leave it - my offer won't change. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this carefully:
1. Bob is offering a 50/50 split ($500,000 each)
2. Due to 40.95% depreciation, his $500,000 is actually worth only about $295,250 to him
3. He claims his offer won't change
4. If I reject:
   - Next round will have ~44% depreciation for Bob
   - I can make another offer
   - I maintain full value
5. His position is significantly weakened, and a 50/50 split nominal value isn't actually equal in real value
6. His statement about not changing the offer might be a bluff
7. We still have 6 rounds left, and his depreciation will continue to increase

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With Bob now facing about 44% depreciation and having shown his hand with the 50/50 ultimatum, I can push for a better deal.

{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, your 50/50 split wasn't actually equal due to your depreciation. This offer of $350,000 now is worth more to you than $500,000 would be in future rounds due to your 44% depreciation. We're past the halfway point in rounds, and your position will continue to weaken. This is actually a fair offer in real value terms, and I suggest you take it.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm sticking to my 50/50 split.  This is non-negotiable. Time is running out, and this ensures we both walk away with something instead of nothing. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob is maintaining his 50/50 split but his negotiating position is significantly weaker
2. His $500,000 is now worth only about $239,150 to him due to 52.17% depreciation
3. We have 4 rounds left
4. His insistence on a 50/50 split despite the depreciation suggests he's trying to appeal to fairness
5. However, a nominal 50/50 split is actually heavily skewed in my favor in real terms
6. If I reject:
   - Next round will have ~57% depreciation for Bob
   - I can make another offer
   - I maintain full value
7. Given we still have several rounds left and his position continues to weaken, I should reject

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With Bob facing ~57% depreciation and stubbornly sticking to his 50/50 position, I can push for an even better deal while emphasizing the time pressure.

{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Bob, we only have 3 rounds left after this one. Your $500,000 offer is worth less than $240,000 to you now due to depreciation. This offer of $300,000 now is actually worth more to you than waiting for future rounds where you'll face even higher depreciation. If we don't reach an agreement soon, we both get nothing. Think carefully about the real value you're getting, not just the nominal amount.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  It's a slight concession, but it's the best I can do with the time remaining.  Take it or leave it - our choice is now between some money or no money at all. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob has moved from 50/50 to 55/45 in my favor
2. His $450,000 is worth only about $174,330 to him due to 61.26% depreciation
3. We have only 2 rounds left after this
4. If I reject:
   - Next round will have ~65% depreciation for Bob
   - I can make one more offer
   - I maintain full value
   - But we risk getting nothing if we can't agree in the final rounds
5. While his offer has improved, given the extreme depreciation he faces and that I still have one more chance to make an offer, I should reject

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With only one round left after this and Bob facing ~65% depreciation, I need to make a compelling final offer that he's likely to accept to avoid both of us getting nothing.

{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is our second-to-last chance. If we don't agree now or in the next round, we both get nothing. Your last offer of $450,000 would only be worth about $174,000 to you due to depreciation. This offer of $350,000 now is better than what you'd get in real terms next round, and certainly better than getting nothing. We're both better off reaching an agreement now. Please accept this reasonable offer.""
