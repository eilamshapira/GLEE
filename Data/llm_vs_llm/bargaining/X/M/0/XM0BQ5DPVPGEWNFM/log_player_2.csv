"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Given that you face 10% depreciation each round while I don't, this is a fair offer that gives you $400000 right now instead of less valuable money later. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I understand the disadvantage I'm at, but your initial offer was far too skewed.  This is a more reasonable starting point for negotiation, recognizing that waiting does cost me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Consider this carefully, Bob. Due to the 20% depreciation you now face, your $450000 from this offer is actually worth more than what you'd get from a larger nominal amount in future rounds. This is a fair offer given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I need to push Alice a bit more, even though the time pressure is on. Accepting now would be giving in too quickly."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a negotiation, and we need to find a compromise. I'm willing to absorb some of the inflation hit, but your offers haven't budged.  Let's be reasonable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. With 30% depreciation, a smaller amount now is worth more to you than a larger amount later. This $400000 now is worth more than $520000 in future rounds due to your increasing depreciation. If we keep going, your position will only weaken. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to use the time pressure against me, but I still believe holding out for a better deal is worth the risk.  She's not budging from her initial offer, which means she likely has some wiggle room."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is the fairest deal and ensures we both benefit.  Take it or leave it - my offer won't change.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your 50/50 split wasn't actually equal due to your depreciation. This offer of $350000 now is worth more to you than $500000 would be in future rounds due to your 44% depreciation. We're past the halfway point in rounds, and your position will continue to weaken. This is actually a fair offer in real value terms, and I suggest you take it. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting closer to my starting point, which indicates I'm applying enough pressure.  However, her offer is still unacceptable.  I need to hold firm and show I'm willing to risk it all."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"":  ""Alice, I'm sticking to my 50/50 split.  This is non-negotiable. Time is running out, and this ensures we both walk away with something instead of nothing.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we only have 3 rounds left after this one. Your $500000 offer is worth less than $240000 to you now due to depreciation. This offer of $300000 now is actually worth more to you than waiting for future rounds where you'll face even higher depreciation. If we don't reach an agreement soon, we both get nothing. Think carefully about the real value you're getting, not just the nominal amount. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough one. While the time pressure is immense, Alice moving further down from her initial offer signifies I hold some leverage. I'll have to take a gamble and hope she folds in the next round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  It's a slight concession, but it's the best I can do with the time remaining.  Take it or leave it - our choice is now between some money or no money at all.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is our second-to-last chance. If we don't agree now or in the next round, we both get nothing. Your last offer of $450000 would only be worth about $174000 to you due to depreciation. This offer of $350000 now is better than what you'd get in real terms next round, and certainly better than getting nothing. We're both better off reaching an agreement now. Please accept this reasonable offer. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's painful, but I have to accept.  Holding out any longer risks getting nothing at all.  This was a calculated risk, and while I didn't get the ideal outcome, I'm still walking away with something."
