"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 50-50 split which I think is fair for both of us. With inflation affecting me by 5% each round, we're both better off agreeing quickly. A fair split now means we both walk away with the maximum value. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's a fair split, and there's no advantage to waiting since inflation doesn't affect me. Let's end the game with both of us walking away with an equal share."
