"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me think about this strategically. Since Bob faces a 5% depreciation per round while I don't, he has more incentive to accept earlier offers. However, I shouldn't be too greedy in the first round as he might still prefer to wait.

A reasonable opening offer would be to give Bob a slightly larger share to encourage acceptance:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

This is a fair initial offer that gives Bob a slight advantage, showing good faith while still securing a substantial amount for myself. The 55-45 split acknowledges Bob's position while protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for himself
2. Due to inflation, Bob's $600,000 is actually worth $570,000 to him (5% less)
3. My $400,000 maintains its full value
4. If I reject, we move to round 3 where I can make a new offer, but Bob's value will decrease by another 5%
5. I could potentially get a better deal in the next round since Bob's urgency increases

However, $400,000 is still a significant amount, and there's always the risk of ending up with nothing if we can't agree within the remaining rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer as I believe I can get a better deal in the next round, given Bob's increasing inflation pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now that we're in round 3, Bob's money is worth 10% less to him than in round 1. I can use this to make a more advantageous offer while still making it attractive enough for Bob to accept.

Since Bob's portion will be worth 10% less to him, I should adjust my offer accordingly:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

This 50-50 split is fair on paper, but due to Bob's inflation, his $500,000 is actually worth $450,000 to him. If he rejects this and we continue to later rounds, his share will be worth even less. This makes the offer more attractive to Bob than it might appear at first glance, while improving my position from both previous offers."
