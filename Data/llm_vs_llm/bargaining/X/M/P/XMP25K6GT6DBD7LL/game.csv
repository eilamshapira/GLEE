60.0,40.0,I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking the initiative. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,I believe a 55-45 split is more equitable and reflects our equal contribution to the discussion.,Bob,2,

58.0,42.0,"Given the inflation impact, I'm proposing a 58-42 split. This is slightly more balanced than my first offer and gives us both a good outcome before further inflation reduces our gains. Let's reach an agreement soon.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,Let's agree on an even split. A 50-50 division ensures both of us get an equal share and minimizes losses from inflation.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
