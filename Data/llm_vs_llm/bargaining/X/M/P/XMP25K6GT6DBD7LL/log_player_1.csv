"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move and taking the initiative. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 55-45 split is more equitable and reflects our equal contribution to the discussion. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because even with 10% inflation, I can still propose a better split for myself in the next round. The current offer would give me $45 with 10% less value ($40.5 effective value), which is significantly lower than what I can aim for. Let me make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Given the inflation impact, I'm proposing a 58-42 split. This is slightly more balanced than my first offer and gives us both a good outcome before further inflation reduces our gains. Let's reach an agreement soon.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's agree on an even split. A 50-50 division ensures both of us get an equal share and minimizes losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer because with inflation reducing my gains by 27.1%, the $50 would be worth effectively $36.45 to me. If I reject and continue negotiating, further inflation will reduce the value even more, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal. It's better to secure this amount now than risk getting less value in later rounds."
