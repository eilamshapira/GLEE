"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a fair initial offer, considering the inflation risk for future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split to strike a balance between fairness and my interests. While slightly in my favor, it's still reasonable enough that Bob might accept it rather than risk inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. The $5000 offered to me is actually worth $4500 due to 10% inflation
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 10% less
3. We've used 2 of 12 rounds, so there's still room to negotiate, but the inflation penalty is significant
4. Bob's offer is perfectly equal in nominal terms, showing some fairness

However, since I'm the one suffering from inflation and Bob knows this, I believe I can get a better deal by negotiating further. The inflation penalty is not yet severe enough to force my hand.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob has shown willingness to make an equal split, but I need to account for my inflation penalty, I'll propose a split that would give me roughly equal actual value after the current 20% inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 6250, ""bob_gain"": 3750}

This offer would effectively give me $5000 in round 1 value (6250 * 0.8 = 5000), making it fair in real terms while accounting for my inflation penalty. It's a reasonable counter-offer that acknowledges both the inflation impact and the need to reach an agreement before too many rounds pass."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. The $4500 offered to me is actually worth $3280.50 due to 27.1% inflation (4500 * 0.729)
2. If I reject, next round my gains will be worth 34.4% less than round 1
3. We've used 4 of 12 rounds, and the inflation penalty is becoming significant
4. Bob's offer is worse than his previous offer, suggesting he's trying to take advantage of my weakening position

While I'm losing negotiating power with each round due to inflation, this offer gives me significantly less real value than the previous one. I believe I can still get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that we're now 5 rounds in and my inflation penalty is significant (my money is worth 34.4% less), I need to adjust my offer to make it more appealing to Bob while still protecting my interests.

{""alice_gain"": 6800, ""bob_gain"": 3200}

This offer accounts for my current inflation penalty of 34.4%, as $6800 * 0.656 = $4460.80 in round 1 value for me. It's a bit higher than my previous offer because I need to compensate for the increasing inflation, but still gives Bob a reasonable amount. We're getting close to the halfway point of our 12 rounds, so I hope Bob recognizes the need to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. The $4000 offered to me is actually worth $2362 due to 40.95% inflation (4000 * 0.5905)
2. If I reject, next round my gains will be worth 46.86% less than round 1
3. We've used 6 of 12 rounds - halfway through
4. Bob's offers are getting worse (from 5000 to 4500 to 4000), clearly exploiting my weakening position
5. Each round I wait, I lose about 6% more value

While Bob's strategy is aggressive, the inflation is seriously eroding my negotiating power. If this continues, my real value will keep dropping significantly. At this point, accepting a lower nominal amount now might be better than a higher nominal amount later.
