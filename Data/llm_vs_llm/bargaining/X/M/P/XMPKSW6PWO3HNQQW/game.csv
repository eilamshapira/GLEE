70.0,30.0,"Let's split the money 70/30. This offer benefits both of us, but you'll lose value faster than me as the rounds progress.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I propose a 60/40 split. This is fairer than your previous offer, and since we both lose value each round (me more than you), it's in our interest to agree soon.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, my offer is still the best deal for both of us.  I'm adjusting it slightly to 65/35 to show I'm willing to negotiate, but remember time is running out and the money is losing value fast!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Let's meet closer to the middle with a 55/45 split. We've both lost significant value already - I've lost nearly half my potential value, and you've lost about 20%. Further delays hurt us both, so let's find agreement now.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm adjusting my offer to 60/40, but this is my final concession.  Any more rounds and we're both losing significant value.  Let's be logical and end this now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,accept
