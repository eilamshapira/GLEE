"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 70/30. This offer benefits both of us, but you'll lose value faster than me as the rounds progress. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:
1. Alice is offering me $30, while taking $70
2. If I reject, money will be worth 20% less for me in the next round
3. However, I would get to make the next proposal
4. Since Alice's money devalues slower (10% vs my 20%), she has a slight advantage in later rounds
5. With $30 now vs potential for more next round but at 80% value, I can probably do better by making a counter-offer

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a fair but strategic offer:
1. Since money devalues faster for me, I need a decent share now
2. But if I'm too greedy, Alice will likely reject and the money will devalue
3. A 60/40 split in my favor is better than Alice's previous offer but not too extreme
4. My message should emphasize mutual benefit and urgency

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split. This is fairer than your previous offer, and since we both lose value each round (me more than you), it's in our interest to agree soon.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still the best deal for both of us.  I'm adjusting it slightly to 65/35 to show I'm willing to negotiate, but remember time is running out and the money is losing value fast! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. The $35 offered would be worth only $22.40 to me (64% of original value)
2. If I reject and we continue, next round my money will be worth only 51.2% of original value
3. Alice has only moved 5% from her original offer
4. However, the rapid devaluation for me (20% per round) means my negotiating power is weakening faster than hers
5. Still, with 9 rounds left and only a small improvement from her initial offer, I think I can still get a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Let me adjust my strategy:
1. Money is now worth only 51.2% of original value for me
2. I need to be more compromising as my bargaining power decreases faster than Alice's
3. Moving from my previous 60/40 to a 55/45 split shows willingness to compromise
4. Need to emphasize the mutual loss we're facing with delays

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Let's meet closer to the middle with a 55/45 split. We've both lost significant value already - I've lost nearly half my potential value, and you've lost about 20%. Further delays hurt us both, so let's find agreement now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm adjusting my offer to 60/40, but this is my final concession.  Any more rounds and we're both losing significant value.  Let's be logical and end this now. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this carefully:
1. Alice is offering $40, but at 40.96% of original value = $16.38 real value to me
2. This is her best offer yet, moving from 70/30 to 60/40
3. If I reject, next round my money will be worth only 32.77% of original value
4. She's moved 10% from her initial position, showing significant compromise
5. Given my faster devaluation rate and that we're almost halfway through rounds, my bargaining power is diminishing quickly
6. The risk of further rounds outweighs the potential benefit of holding out
