"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less next round when I make an offer
3. $400,000 now is better than $450,000 next round due to the 10% inflation
4. While not a 50-50 split, it's a substantial amount
5. There's risk in rejecting as we only have 12 rounds and inflation keeps reducing value

Given these factors, I'll accept the offer. While I could try to negotiate for more, the guaranteed $400,000 now is better than risking further rounds with inflation.
