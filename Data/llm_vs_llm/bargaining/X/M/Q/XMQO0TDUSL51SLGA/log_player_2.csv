"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is $400,000 for me and $600,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less in the next round
3. I would be making the next offer if I reject
4. $400,000 is a substantial amount, though less than half
5. If I reject, my next round maximum potential gain would be $950,000 (95% of 1M)

While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk in rejection:
- Inflation will reduce the value
- Alice might reject my counter-offer
- We could end up in a back-and-forth that reduces value for both
- 12 rounds limit adds pressure

$400,000 is a reasonable offer, considering these factors.
