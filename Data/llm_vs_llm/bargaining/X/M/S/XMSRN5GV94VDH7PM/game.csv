60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Let's be more reasonable, a 55-45 split is more fair considering we're just starting out and there's still room for negotiation. Accepting this offer will also minimize the impact of inflation for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
70.0,30.0,"Bob, I need a larger share because inflation affects me much more severely (20% per round) than it affects you (5% per round). With this 70-30 split, accounting for inflation, I'd actually get 56$ in real value (70 * 0.8), while you'd get 28.5$ (30 * 0.95). This is fair given our different inflation rates.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Given the significant difference in inflation rates, a 50-50 split seems the most fair. It accounts for the fact that your share decreases more rapidly, while also considering my own loss due to inflation. Let's split it evenly and finalize the deal.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
75.0,25.0,"Bob, let's be mathematical about this. With the current inflation rates, a 75-25 split would give me about 38.4$ in real value (75 * 0.512) and you about 21.4$ (25 * 0.8574). This is actually quite balanced when you consider our different inflation rates. We should agree now before inflation reduces both our shares even further.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
47.5,52.5,"Considering the increasing impact of inflation on both our shares, I'm willing to make a compromise. A 52.5-47.5 split acknowledges your higher inflation rate while also ensuring I receive a fair share. Let's agree on this before further inflation erodes our potential gains.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
85.0,15.0,"Bob, we're running out of time and inflation is severely impacting both of us. With current rates, this 85-15 split would give me 27.85$ in real value (85 * 0.3277) and you 11.61$ (15 * 0.7738). This is much more balanced than it appears given my 67.23% inflation vs your 22.62%. Let's agree now before we both lose even more value.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
40.0,60.0,"Given the drastic impact of inflation on your share, I'm willing to reconsider the split. A 60-40 split in my favor may seem unfair at first, but considering your severe inflation rate, it's actually a more balanced offer than it appears. Let's finalize the deal before we both lose out due to inflation.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
90.0,10.0,"Bob, we only have a few rounds left before we both get nothing. With current rates, this 90-10 split would give me 18.87$ in real value (90 * 0.2097) and you 6.98$ (10 * 0.6983). While this might seem extreme, it's the only way to achieve somewhat comparable real values given my catastrophic 79% inflation versus your 30%. Please accept before we both end up with zero.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
35.0,65.0,"We're running out of time, and I understand the severe impact of inflation on your share. However, I also need to consider my own losses. A 65-35 split is my final compromise, taking into account the drastic difference in our inflation rates. If we don't agree now, we risk losing everything.",Bob,10,
