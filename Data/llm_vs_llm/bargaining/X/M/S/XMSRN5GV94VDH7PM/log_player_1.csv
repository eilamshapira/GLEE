"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more reasonable, a 55-45 split is more fair considering we're just starting out and there's still room for negotiation. Accepting this offer will also minimize the impact of inflation for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 45-55 split would only give me 36$ in real value (45 * 0.8) due to the 20% inflation on my side. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that takes this inflation differential into account."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, 
""bob_gain"": 30, 
""message"": ""Bob, I need a larger share because inflation affects me much more severely (20% per round) than it affects you (5% per round). With this 70-30 split, accounting for inflation, I'd actually get 56$ in real value (70 * 0.8), while you'd get 28.5$ (30 * 0.95). This is fair given our different inflation rates.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant difference in inflation rates, a 50-50 split seems the most fair. It accounts for the fact that your share decreases more rapidly, while also considering my own loss due to inflation. Let's split it evenly and finalize the deal. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With the current inflation rates, a 50-50 split would give me only 25.6$ in real value (50 * 0.512), while Bob would get about 42.87$ (50 * 0.8574). This is still too unfavorable given how much more severely inflation affects my share. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 75, 
""bob_gain"": 25, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be mathematical about this. With the current inflation rates, a 75-25 split would give me about 38.4$ in real value (75 * 0.512) and you about 21.4$ (25 * 0.8574). This is actually quite balanced when you consider our different inflation rates. We should agree now before inflation reduces both our shares even further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the increasing impact of inflation on both our shares, I'm willing to make a compromise. A 52.5-47.5 split acknowledges your higher inflation rate while also ensuring I receive a fair share. Let's agree on this before further inflation erodes our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 47.5 
# Bob gain: 52.5 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With current inflation rates, this offer would give me only 15.56$ in real value (47.5 * 0.3277), while Bob would get about 40.62$ (52.5 * 0.7738). The gap between our real gains is still too large due to the different inflation rates. I need to counter with a better offer that accounts for this severe disparity."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 85, 
""bob_gain"": 15, 
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time and inflation is severely impacting both of us. With current rates, this 85-15 split would give me 27.85$ in real value (85 * 0.3277) and you 11.61$ (15 * 0.7738). This is much more balanced than it appears given my 67.23% inflation vs your 22.62%. Let's agree now before we both lose even more value.""}"

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the drastic impact of inflation on your share, I'm willing to reconsider the split. A 60-40 split in my favor may seem unfair at first, but considering your severe inflation rate, it's actually a more balanced offer than it appears. Let's finalize the deal before we both lose out due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

With current inflation rates, this offer would give me only 8.39$ in real value (40 * 0.2097), while Bob would get about 41.9$ (60 * 0.6983). The real value gap has become even more extreme. Even though we're running out of time, this split is too unfavorable given how severely inflation affects my share. I need to make one more attempt at a fairer split."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 90, 
""bob_gain"": 10, 
""message"": ""Bob, we only have a few rounds left before we both get nothing. With current rates, this 90-10 split would give me 18.87$ in real value (90 * 0.2097) and you 6.98$ (10 * 0.6983). While this might seem extreme, it's the only way to achieve somewhat comparable real values given my catastrophic 79% inflation versus your 30%. Please accept before we both end up with zero.""}"

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're running out of time, and I understand the severe impact of inflation on your share. However, I also need to consider my own losses. A 65-35 split is my final compromise, taking into account the drastic difference in our inflation rates. If we don't agree now, we risk losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Although this gives me only 4.70$ in real value (35 * 0.1342) compared to Bob's 40.96$ (65 * 0.6302), we're running out of time and the next rounds would reduce my share even further. With only two rounds left and such severe inflation on my side, this might be the best real value I can get at this point. Better to secure something than risk getting nothing."
