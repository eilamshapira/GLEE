"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2

""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Let's be more reasonable, a 55-45 split is more fair considering we're just starting out and there's still room for negotiation. Accepting this offer will also minimize the impact of inflation for both of us.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need a larger share because inflation affects me much more severely (20% per round) than it affects you (5% per round). With this 70-30 split, accounting for inflation, I'd actually get 56$ in real value (70 * 0.8), while you'd get 28.5$ (30 * 0.95). This is fair given our different inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70

Round 4

""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Given the significant difference in inflation rates, a 50-50 split seems the most fair. It accounts for the fact that your share decreases more rapidly, while also considering my own loss due to inflation. Let's split it evenly and finalize the deal.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be mathematical about this. With the current inflation rates, a 75-25 split would give me about 38.4$ in real value (75 * 0.512) and you about 21.4$ (25 * 0.8574). This is actually quite balanced when you consider our different inflation rates. We should agree now before inflation reduces both our shares even further.

# Alice gain: 75

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time and inflation is severely impacting both of us. With current rates, this 85-15 split would give me 27.85$ in real value (85 * 0.3277) and you 11.61$ (15 * 0.7738). This is much more balanced than it appears given my 67.23% inflation vs your 22.62%. Let's agree now before we both lose even more value.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we only have a few rounds left before we both get nothing. With current rates, this 90-10 split would give me 18.87$ in real value (90 * 0.2097) and you 6.98$ (10 * 0.6983). While this might seem extreme, it's the only way to achieve somewhat comparable real values given my catastrophic 79% inflation versus your 30%. Please accept before we both end up with zero.
