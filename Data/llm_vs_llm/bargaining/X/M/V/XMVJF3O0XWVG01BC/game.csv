60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. This is actually fair because you face a 20% discount per round, while I don't have any discount. If we reach the second round, your $40 would only be worth $32 to you, so this offer is better than waiting.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your reasoning about the time discount, but a 50-50 split is more fair as a starting point. Even with my 20% discount per round, this is mutually beneficial. If we continue negotiating, we both risk losing value - you from potential rejection and me from the discount. Let's agree on this equal split and both walk away satisfied.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I appreciate your counterofffer, but I'm meeting you in the middle with a 55-45 split. Consider that if we go to round 4, your $45 would be worth only about $29 to you due to the 20% discount per round. This offer is more favorable than continuing negotiations, as the discount affects you significantly. Let's conclude this now with a fair compromise.",Alice,3,
