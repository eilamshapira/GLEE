"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. This is actually fair because you face a 20% discount per round, while I don't have any discount. If we reach the second round, your $40 would only be worth $32 to you, so this offer is better than waiting.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your reasoning about the time discount, but a 50-50 split is more fair as a starting point. Even with my 20% discount per round, this is mutually beneficial. If we continue negotiating, we both risk losing value - you from potential rejection and me from the discount. Let's agree on this equal split and both walk away satisfied. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counterofffer, but I'm meeting you in the middle with a 55-45 split. Consider that if we go to round 4, your $45 would be worth only about $29 to you due to the 20% discount per round. This offer is more favorable than continuing negotiations, as the discount affects you significantly. Let's conclude this now with a fair compromise.""}"
