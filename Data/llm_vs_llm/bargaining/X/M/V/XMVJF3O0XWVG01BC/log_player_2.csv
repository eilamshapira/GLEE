"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. This is actually fair because you face a 20% discount per round, while I don't have any discount. If we reach the second round, your $40 would only be worth $32 to you, so this offer is better than waiting. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think through this carefully. Alice is right about the time discount affecting me, but I need to consider if this is the best deal I can get.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I'll face a 20% discount. However, I could potentially propose a more favorable split to make up for this discount.

If I accept now, I get $40. If I reject and we eventually reach an agreement next round, I'd need to get at least $50 to end up with the equivalent of $40 after the 20% discount.

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer, especially since Alice has no time pressure.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable counter-offer that accounts for the time discount I face while being attractive enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your reasoning about the time discount, but a 50-50 split is more fair as a starting point. Even with my 20% discount per round, this is mutually beneficial. If we continue negotiating, we both risk losing value - you from potential rejection and me from the discount. Let's agree on this equal split and both walk away satisfied.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counterofffer, but I'm meeting you in the middle with a 55-45 split. Consider that if we go to round 4, your $45 would be worth only about $29 to you due to the 20% discount per round. This offer is more favorable than continuing negotiations, as the discount affects you significantly. Let's conclude this now with a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully.

Currently, Alice is offering me $45. However, due to the 36% inflation in this round, this $45 is actually worth $45 Ã— (1 - 0.36) = $28.80 to me in terms of round 1 value.

If I reject and we move to round 4, I'd face even more inflation (about 49% from round 1). Alice is right that any further delays significantly hurt my position.

Alice has moved from a 60-40 split to a 55-45 split, showing willingness to compromise. If I reject this offer, Alice might become less willing to negotiate, and my bargaining power continues to decrease with each round.

Given the time pressure I face and the reasonable improvement in the offer, I'll accept.
