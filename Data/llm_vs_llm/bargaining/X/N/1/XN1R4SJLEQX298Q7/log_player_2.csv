"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Current offer is $40 for me and $60 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, any money I get next round will be worth 10% less to me
4. If I reject, $40 next round would only be worth $36 to me

While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of losing value due to inflation makes this a reasonable offer. If I reject, I'd need to secure significantly more than $44.44 ($40/0.9) in the next round just to break even.
