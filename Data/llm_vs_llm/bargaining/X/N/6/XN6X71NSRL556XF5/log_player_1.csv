"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the higher inflation penalty I face. Since I lose 20% value per round compared to Bob's 10%, I should ask for slightly more to offset this disadvantage.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a reasonable offer considering that if Bob rejects, we both lose value, with me losing more than him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept Bob's offer now, I get $4000, but it's worth 20% less, so effectively $3200
2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   - The money will be worth even less (another 20% drop)
   - I'd need to propose something Bob would accept
   - Bob knows he has an advantage due to the lower inflation rate he faces

While Bob's offer isn't great, rejecting it would likely lead to an even worse outcome for me due to the harsh inflation penalty I face. The next round would reduce values significantly more.
