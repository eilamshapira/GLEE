"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know the inflation hurts us both as the rounds progress—especially you, with a steeper discount. Accepting my offer now gives you 450K in today's value instead of risking further loss. I believe a 55/45 split in my favor is fair under these conditions. Let's settle promptly and avoid additional inflation losses. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I should take into account that the actual value of the $450,000 offered to me is $450,000 * 0.9 = $405,000.

Given this, I think I can try to get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 10% less than in the first round, and another 10% less than in the second round, so it's worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value. The money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round, and another 5% less than in the second round, so it's worth 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of the original value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000, 
""message"": ""Let's settle before inflation hurts us more, I'm being generous considering the discount""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, each round further erodes our total gains. In round 4, accepting this offer gives you an effective value (at your 27.1% discount) equal to what you'd secure if you waited until round 5. I’m proposing 689660 for me and 310340 for you—a division that precisely matches your continuation value. Let's settle now before inflation takes a heavier toll. 
# Alice gain: 310340 
# Bob gain: 689660 
Do you accept this offer?","To calculate the actual value of the offer, I need to consider the inflation discount. The money I gain is worth 72.9% of the original value (1 - 0.271 = 0.729).

The actual value of Bob's offer for me is: $310,340 * 0.729 = $226,118.06

Given this, I should compare it to what I could potentially get in the next round, taking into account the further inflation discount.
