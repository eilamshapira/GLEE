Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, I know the inflation hurts us both as the rounds progress—especially you, with a steeper discount. Accepting my offer now gives you 450K in today's value instead of risking further loss. I believe a 55/45 split in my favor is fair under these conditions. Let's settle promptly and avoid additional inflation losses.""}"

# Alice's message: Let's settle before inflation hurts us more, I'm being generous considering the discount 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 689660, ""alice_gain"": 310340, ""message"": ""Alice, each round further erodes our total gains. In round 4, accepting this offer gives you an effective value (at your 27.1% discount) equal to what you'd secure if you waited until round 5. I’m proposing 689,660 for me and 310,340 for you—a division that precisely matches your continuation value. Let's settle now before inflation takes a heavier toll.""}"
