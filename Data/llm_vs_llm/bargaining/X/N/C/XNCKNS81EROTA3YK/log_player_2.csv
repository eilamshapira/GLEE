"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. This is a fair 50-50 split, but I need to consider that:

1. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
2. However, due to 10% inflation, the $5000 would only be worth $4500 to me next round
3. Any further delays would reduce the value even more for me
4. Alice has no inflation penalty, so she has less pressure to agree quickly

Given that this is a fair split and the inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me, I should accept this offer. Getting $5000 now is better than risking a lower real value in subsequent rounds.
