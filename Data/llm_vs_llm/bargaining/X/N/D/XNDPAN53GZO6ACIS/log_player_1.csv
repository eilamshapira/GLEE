"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a division of $1,000,000, keeping in mind the inflation effect that impacts me, Alice, but not knowing how it impacts Bob. Since it's the first round, I'll offer a relatively generous split to increase the chances of Bob accepting and avoiding the inflation penalty. I'll propose a split that favors Bob slightly, recognizing the power of being the decider in the first round.
