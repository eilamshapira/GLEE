"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think 55-45 is a more reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob is offering me $45
2. He would get $55, but due to inflation, it's worth 10% less to him (effectively worth $49.5 to him)
3. My previous offer was rejected where I would have gotten $60
4. If I reject, we go to another round, but I don't know how much more inflation will affect Bob

While this offer is less than what I proposed, it's still a reasonable split, and continuing the negotiation might lead to worse outcomes if inflation continues to affect Bob's side. The current offer gives me a decent share without the risk of further negotiations.
