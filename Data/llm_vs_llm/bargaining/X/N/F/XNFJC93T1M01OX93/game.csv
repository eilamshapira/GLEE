55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for me since I'm making the first offer. If you reject, we both lose 5% value, so this is actually better than a 50/50 split in the next round.",Alice,1,

47.5,52.5,"Hi Alice, since the pool has decreased in value, let's both benefit more by reversing the 55-45 split. This time, I'll take 52.5 and offer you 47.5. It's fair considering the reduced total.",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Let's be fair and split it 50/50. With continued inflation, we're both losing value with each round. This is a perfectly equal split that maximizes our collective return.",Alice,3,
