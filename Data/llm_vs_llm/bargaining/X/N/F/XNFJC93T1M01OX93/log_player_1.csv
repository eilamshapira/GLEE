Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since the pool has decreased in value, let's both benefit more by reversing the 55-45 split. This time, I'll take 52.5 and offer you 47.5. It's fair considering the reduced total. 
# Alice gain: 47.5 
# Bob gain: 52.5 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
