"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly favorable split for me since I'm making the first offer. If you reject, we both lose 5% value, so this is actually better than a 50/50 split in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52.5, ""alice_gain"": 47.5, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, since the pool has decreased in value, let's both benefit more by reversing the 55-45 split. This time, I'll take 52.5 and offer you 47.5. It's fair considering the reduced total.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 50/50. With continued inflation, we're both losing value with each round. This is a perfectly equal split that maximizes our collective return. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
