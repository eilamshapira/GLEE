"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I get 60 and you get 40. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice offers me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, in the next round the money will be worth less to me
4. $40 now is better than potentially getting more later but with 5% less value
5. While not exactly equal, $40 is a reasonable offer given the inflation risk
