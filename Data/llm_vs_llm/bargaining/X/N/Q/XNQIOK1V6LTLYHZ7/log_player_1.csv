"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the fact that money will be worth less for me if we go to another round, while Bob doesn't face this penalty. I should offer something fair but attractive enough to get accepted.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because it's slightly in my favor but still reasonable enough that Bob might accept it rather than move to the next round. If we go to the next round, my purchasing power will decrease by 10%, so it's important to reach an agreement now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this carefully. 

If I accept Bob's offer of $45, due to the 10% inflation penalty, it's actually worth $40.50 to me. 

If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, any amount I receive will be worth 20% less than the original value. So even if I propose a better split in my favor next round, I'll need to get significantly more to make up for the additional 10% loss.

Given this, while Bob's offer isn't ideal, accepting it now is likely better than continuing to negotiate with increasing inflation penalties.
