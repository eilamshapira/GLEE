"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether to accept Alice's offer or reject it and make a counter-offer.

Alice is offering me $45 out of $100, while taking $55 for herself.

If I reject, I can make my own proposal in the next round. However, I should note that while inflation doesn't affect me (0%), it affects Alice (10% per round). This means in the next round, the $100 would be worth only $90 to Alice.

Given this inflation effect, I have some leverage in negotiations since Alice has more urgency to reach an agreement.

I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counter-offer taking into account that inflation affects Alice but not me.

Since the money is worth 10% less to Alice this round, she'll value the $100 pot at only $90. This gives me some leverage in negotiation.

I'll propose a fair split considering this dynamic:

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm offering Alice $45, which is worth about $40.50 to her now due to the 10% inflation. This is less than what she'd get from her original offer after inflation, but it's still a substantial amount. This division gives me a slight advantage while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept rather than moving to another round where inflation would affect her even more."
