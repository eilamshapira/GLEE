"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since this is the first round, I'll make a relatively fair offer while considering that Bob faces a 20% devaluation per round if he refuses.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

The reason for this split is that while a 50-50 split might seem fairest, Bob should consider that if he refuses, his next round's money will be worth 20% less to him. Therefore, getting $40 now is better than potentially getting more in the next round with decreased value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

For Bob, his $50 is actually only worth $40 (50 * 0.8) due to the 20% inflation he faces.
For me (Alice), the $50 maintains its full value.

While this is a 50-50 split nominally, I can potentially get a better deal by rejecting and making a new offer in the next round, where Bob's position will be even weaker due to further inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob faces even more devaluation now (his money is worth 60% of original value in this round), I'll adjust my offer accordingly:

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

The reasoning is:
1. For Bob, $35 in this round is actually worth $21 (35 * 0.6) due to accumulated inflation
2. If he rejects, his next round's money will be worth even less (only 48% of original value)
3. This offer gives him a better real value than waiting for future rounds
4. It's a reasonable progression from my previous offer of 60-40"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

For Bob, his $55 is actually only worth $26.84 (55 * 0.488) due to the compounding inflation he faces.
For me (Alice), the $45 maintains its full value.

This offer is actually worse for me than my previous offer, and given that Bob's position continues to weaken with each round due to inflation, I can likely get a better deal by rejecting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Bob's money is now worth only about 39% of its original value (after multiple rounds of 20% devaluation), I'll make an offer that reflects this weakened position while still being acceptable enough to hopefully end the game:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

The reasoning is:
1. For Bob, $30 in this round is worth about $11.70 (30 * 0.39) due to accumulated inflation
2. If he rejects, his next round's money will be worth even less
3. It's better for him to accept this now than to continue negotiating as his position will only get worse
4. The offer progresses logically from my previous offers, reflecting his deteriorating position"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

For Bob, his $58 is only worth $19 (58 * 0.3277) due to the severe inflation he now faces.
For me (Alice), the $42 maintains its full value.

This offer is significantly worse than my previous offers, and Bob's position continues to severely weaken with each round due to inflation. The real value of Bob's share is dropping dramatically, which means I can likely get a much better deal by rejecting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Bob's money is now worth only about 26.2% of its original value (after six rounds of 20% devaluation), I'll make a stronger offer that reflects his significantly weakened position:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

The reasoning is:
1. For Bob, $20 in this round is worth only about $5.24 (20 * 0.262) due to accumulated inflation
2. If he rejects, his next round's money will be worth even less (about 21% of original value)
3. Even though this might seem like a harsh offer, it's actually rational for Bob to accept because:
   - His negotiating position is severely compromised by inflation
   - Further delays will only make his position worse
   - The real value he can get in future rounds will be even lower
4. This is a logical progression from my previous 70-30 offer, reflecting the continued deterioration of his position"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

For Bob, his $60 is only worth $12.58 (60 * 0.2097) due to the extreme inflation he now faces.
For me (Alice), the $40 maintains its full value.

This offer is extremely poor compared to my previous offers, and Bob's position is now severely compromised by inflation. His $60 share is worth only about $12.58 in real value, while he's asking me to accept $40 when I previously offered deals that were much better for both of us. With only 4 rounds remaining and his position continuing to weaken, I should reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","With Bob's money now worth only about 16.8% of its original value (after eight rounds of 20% devaluation), and only a few rounds remaining, I'll make an even stronger offer:

{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

The reasoning is:
1. For Bob, $10 in this round is worth only about $1.68 (10 * 0.168) due to accumulated inflation
2. If he rejects, his next round's money will be worth even less (about 13.4% of original value)
3. This is actually a rational offer to accept because:
   - His negotiating position is extremely weak due to severe inflation
   - Only 3 rounds remain before we both get nothing
   - Any future rounds will give him even less real value
   - Getting something is better than nothing
4. The offer reflects the reality of his severely compromised position and the approaching deadline"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

For Bob, his $62 is only worth $8.32 (62 * 0.1342) due to the extreme inflation he now faces.
For me (Alice), the $38 maintains its full value.

This offer is extremely irrational at this point in the game:
1. We only have 2 rounds left before we both get nothing
2. The inflation has severely eroded Bob's position (his $62 is worth only $8.32 in real value)
3. He's asking me to accept less than my previous offers when his position is much weaker
4. I can still make one more offer in the next round

Given these factors, I should definitely reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","With only one round remaining after this and Bob's money now worth only about 10.7% of its original value, I'll make a very strong final offer:

{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}

The reasoning is:
1. For Bob, $5 in this round is worth only about $0.54 (5 * 0.107) due to accumulated inflation
2. This is the second-to-last round - if we don't reach an agreement in the next round, we both get nothing
3. Bob faces a critical decision:
   - Accept this offer and get something (albeit small)
   - Reject and make one final offer in round 12
   - Risk getting nothing if no agreement is reached in round 12
4. Given that getting something is better than nothing, and his position is extremely weak, this offer, while aggressive, is actually rational for him to accept rather than risk getting nothing"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this final offer:

For Bob, his $80 is only worth $6.87 (80 * 0.0859) due to the extreme inflation he now faces.
For me (Alice), the $20 maintains its full value.

This is the final round - if I reject, we both get nothing. However, this offer is extremely poor:
1. Bob is asking for $80 which is worth only $6.87 to him
2. He's asking me to accept $20 when I had much stronger positions in previous rounds
3. His final offer is actually irrational given his severely compromised position

However, $20 is still better than $0, which is what I'll get if I reject. Despite the poor offer, game theory suggests I should accept something rather than nothing.
