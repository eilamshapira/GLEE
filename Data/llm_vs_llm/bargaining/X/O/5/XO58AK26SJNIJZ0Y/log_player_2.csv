{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 540000 
# Alice gain: 460000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Let's calculate the value of the offer considering inflation:
540000 * (1 - 0.512) = 540000 * 0.488 = 263520

This offer in the 5th round is worth 263520 in terms of original money value."
