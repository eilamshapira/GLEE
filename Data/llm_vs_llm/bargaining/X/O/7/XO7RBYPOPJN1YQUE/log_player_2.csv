"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000 of the $10,000. Given that the money loses 5% value for me each round, if I reject this offer, the total value will be $9,500 next round. 

$4,000 now is better than potentially getting a smaller amount in later rounds due to the 5% inflation penalty. However, I believe I can propose a fairer split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I'm now making the offer, I'll propose a more balanced split considering the inflation factor that affects me.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50-50 split of the $10,000. This is a fair division that gives us both equal amounts, which I believe is reasonable and should be acceptable to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this updated offer. Alice is now proposing I get $4,200 while she gets $5,800.

Due to the 9.75% inflation for me, the real value of the $4,200 offer is:
$4,200 × (1 - 0.0975) = $4,200 × 0.9025 = $3,790.50

If I reject, inflation will increase to about 14.75% in the next round, further reducing the value of any money I receive.

Alice has slightly improved her offer from round 1, which indicates some willingness to negotiate. Given the increasing inflation penalty I face and the risk of further delays, I'll accept this offer.
