"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me propose a fair split while accounting for the different inflation rates we face.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this split because we both need to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation, but my money loses value faster (20% per round) compared to Bob's (5% per round). This 60-40 split acknowledges this difference while still being reasonably fair to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation for me, $4500 now is worth effectively $3600 compared to round 1 values.
For Bob, $5500 with 5% inflation is worth about $5225 compared to round 1 values.

While this split favors Bob significantly, waiting another round would mean even more value loss for me due to the high 20% inflation rate. If I reject and make a counter-offer, Bob might reject again, and my share would be worth even less in round 3.
