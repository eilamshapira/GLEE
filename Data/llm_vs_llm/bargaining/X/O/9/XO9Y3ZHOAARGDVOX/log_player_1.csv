"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I'll make my offer in JSON format, keeping in mind the potential for inflation in later rounds. I'll try to be reasonable to avoid rejection.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. My potential gain from the $40 is now worth 20% less. So, it's worth $40 * 0.8 = $32 in Round 1 dollars. Bob is offering me what is equivalent to $32 from Round 1, while he gets the equivalent of 60 dollars from round 1.

That's less than my initial offer to Bob. I will reject this offer, hoping I can get more in the next round when it's my turn.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn again. Inflation is now impacting *both* our gains compared to round 1. Each dollar is now worth 80% of its round 1 value. I need to factor this in when making my offer. I also need to consider that Bob rejected my previous offer and his own counter-offer. I want to be somewhat conciliatory, but also ensure I get a decent return, considering the diminishing value.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
