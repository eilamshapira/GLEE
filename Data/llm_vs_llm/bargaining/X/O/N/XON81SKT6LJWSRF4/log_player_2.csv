"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, 50-50 split. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which would give me $50. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, inflation will reduce the value of money by 5% for me, meaning the $100 pot would effectively be worth $95 to me.

If I'm trying to maximize my gain, I should consider whether I could reasonably get more than $50 in the next round after accounting for inflation. If I proposed a 60-40 split in my favor in the next round, I'd get $60 but it would be worth $57 to me due to inflation.

Since this is a fair initial offer and rejecting would put me at risk of getting less due to inflation, I'll accept.
