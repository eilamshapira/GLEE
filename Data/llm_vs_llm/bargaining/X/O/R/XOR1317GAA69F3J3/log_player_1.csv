"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that Bob faces steeper inflation penalties than I do. This might encourage him to accept early rather than risk losing more value.

{""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm offering you a favorable 45% split, Bob. Given your higher inflation penalty of 20% per round, accepting now would be more beneficial than waiting.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering my higher inflation rate, I'm willing to take a larger share. Accepting now will save us both from further losses. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because even with the 5% inflation penalty I face, I can still make a better counteroffer in the next round. Bob faces a much steeper 20% penalty per round, which gives me leverage to negotiate for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since we're in round 3, I need to consider that any money I receive is worth 10% less than the initial value (due to two rounds of 5% inflation), and Bob's money is worth 40% less (due to two rounds of 20% inflation). I'll use this to make a strategic offer.

{""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, consider that your share is already worth 40% less due to inflation. If you reject this offer, you'll lose another 20% in the next round. This is your best chance to secure a meaningful amount.""}"
