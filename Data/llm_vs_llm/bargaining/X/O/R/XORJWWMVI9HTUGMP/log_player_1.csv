"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

My reasoning is that this split gives me a slight advantage, while still providing Bob with a substantial amount. Hopefully, he'll find it acceptable to avoid further rounds and the associated losses from inflation."
