"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I get a bit more since inflation hits me less. Accept this generous offer, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:

1. She's offering me $450,000 and taking $550,000
2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   * My money will be worth 20% less
   * Her money will be worth 10% less
   * But I get to make the next offer

If I wait one round, my maximum potential gain would be worth 80% of $1M = $800,000
Given that this is just the first round and the difference in her favor isn't too large, I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for the different inflation rates while still being reasonable:

{""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Since inflation hits me harder (20% vs your 10%), I should get a larger share to make it fair. This split accounts for our different inflation rates while still giving you a substantial amount.""}

This offer is fair because:
1. It accounts for my higher inflation rate
2. It's not too greedy - I'm not asking for a huge majority
3. If Alice rejects, her next round value will be worth 10% less, while mine would be 20% less
4. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also understand the game dynamics"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, a little more for me, acknowledging your inflation concerns but securing a reasonable deal for me too. Let's finalize this now before inflation eats further into our profits. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. My $430,000 with 36% inflation is worth effectively $275,200
2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   * Inflation will increase (to about 48% for me, 27% for Alice)
   * But I get to make the next offer
3. Alice is actually offering me less than her first offer ($450,000), even though inflation has increased
4. The gap between our shares has widened from her first offer (now $140,000 difference vs initial $100,000)

This offer is worse than her initial offer, despite my reasonable counter-offer in round 2. The increasing inflation makes it tempting to accept, but this offer seems too unfavorable.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the mounting inflation pressure, I need to make a compelling offer that Alice will likely accept:

{""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's end this now. This is a very fair split considering our different inflation rates. If we continue, inflation will hurt both of us - me more than you. This offer gives us both a good outcome, and it's better than letting inflation eat away our gains.""}

Rationale:
1. I've reduced my demands from the previous offer (525k vs 510k now)
2. The split is close to 50-50, which feels fair
3. With inflation mounting (my money worth 48% less next round if rejected), we need to close this deal
4. The message emphasizes our mutual interest in reaching an agreement
5. This offer should be attractive enough for Alice given that further delays hurt both of us"
