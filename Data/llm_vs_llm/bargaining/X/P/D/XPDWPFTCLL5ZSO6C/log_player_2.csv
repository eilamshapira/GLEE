"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Since Alice values money 5% less each round, I can use this to my advantage. If I reject this 50-50 split now, in the next round:
1. I can make a proposal
2. The money will be worth the same to me (0% depreciation)
3. But worth 5% less to Alice
4. This means Alice would be more likely to accept a proposal giving her less than 500,000

Therefore, I should reject this even split and propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I know that the money is worth 5% less to Alice in this round, I can propose a split that gives me a bit more while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept (since rejecting would mean the money becomes worth even less to her in the next round).

For Alice, $475,000 in this round is equivalent to about $500,000 in the previous round due to the 5% depreciation from her perspective.

I'll propose a split that gives me slightly more while keeping it reasonable enough for Alice to accept:

{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000}

This way:
1. I get more than the original 50-50 split
2. For Alice, this is roughly equivalent to the previous round's value due to the 5% depreciation
3. If she rejects, the next round will be worth even less to her"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is an interesting offer. Let me analyze:

1. Alice is offering me more than I proposed in the previous round (550,000 vs 525,000)
2. This seems counterintuitive since she's taking less for herself
3. However, she might be trying to prevent further rounds where the money would be worth even less to her
4. If I reject, in the next round:
   - I could propose an even more favorable split
   - But Alice might reject again, leading to more rounds
   - There's a risk of getting stuck in a cycle of rejections

Given that:
- I'm already getting a very good deal (55% of the total)
- The offer is better than what I proposed in the previous round
- Further negotiations might lead to mutual losses
- There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round

I'll accept this offer.
