"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that considers our different rates of inflation, which could make this deal beneficial for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I suggest I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. This is a fair offer considering that Bob has a higher inflation rate (10% vs my 5%), meaning waiting is more costly for him than for me. This division gives Bob a substantial portion while recognizing my slight advantage in negotiations due to inflation differences."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting $5 less than my initial proposal, I need to consider that due to inflation, delaying further would reduce the real value of any money I receive. If I reject and we go to another round, the money would be worth even less for both of us. Since my inflation rate is 5%, accepting $55 now is better than potentially getting a slightly higher nominal amount in a future round when it would be worth less in real terms."
