"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I should evaluate Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $60 and keeping $40 for herself. This is actually a reasonable split in my favor. I need to consider the discount factor: while I don't lose value over time (0% discount), Alice faces a 20% discount per round. If I reject and make a counter-offer, she might be motivated to accept a less favorable deal in the next round.

However, $60 is already a good outcome for me, and there's always risk in continuing negotiations. Given that this is a fairly advantageous split already and we're only in round 1, I'll accept this offer.
