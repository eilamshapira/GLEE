"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I want to make a fair offer that Bob is likely to accept, especially considering I'm facing inflation with each round.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a 50-50 split which is perfectly fair. Given that I face 5% inflation each round, it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly, and I believe an equal division gives us the best chance to conclude the game in this first round."
