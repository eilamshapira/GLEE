"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer as it's highly unfavorable to me. Getting only 10% of the total amount ($100,000) while Alice gets 90% ($900,000) is not a fair split. In the next round, I can make a counter-proposal, and even with the 20% inflation penalty, I can still negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. While this might seem aggressive, I need to account for the 20% inflation penalty I'm facing, so my actual value would be closer to $480,000 after inflation. This leaves Alice with a substantial $400,000 while protecting my interests against the inflation effect. This is a more balanced proposal than Alice's initial 90-10 split."
