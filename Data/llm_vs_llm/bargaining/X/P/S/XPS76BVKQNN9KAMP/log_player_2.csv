"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice offers me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   * I can make a counter-offer
   * But the money will be worth 10% less to me
   * $100 will become worth $90 to me
   * So I'd need to get more than $44.44 in next round to beat current $40 offer

Since I can't be certain I'll get a better deal in the next round (given the inflation penalty), and $40 is a reasonable offer, I'll accept.
