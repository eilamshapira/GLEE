"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","While a 50-50 split seems fair at first glance, I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject now, the total value will be worth 10% less to me in the next round, meaning we'd be dividing what feels like 90$ to me. Since I'd be making the next offer, I could propose a split that compensates for this inflation, but Alice might reject it, leading to further devaluation for me.

A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, and a guaranteed $50 now is better than risking lower values due to inflation in future rounds.
