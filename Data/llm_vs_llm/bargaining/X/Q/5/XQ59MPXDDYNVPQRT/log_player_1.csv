I'll take 90% and give Bob the remaining 10%. I want to start with a generous offer to see if Bob is willing to accept a fair split early on."

I'm going to offer Bob 280,000.  I'm taking into account the inflation and offering less than my previous offer, but still a decent amount for Bob.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

While the inflation has hit me hard, I'll accept this offer. It's a significant drop from my initial goal, but it's better than getting nothing."
