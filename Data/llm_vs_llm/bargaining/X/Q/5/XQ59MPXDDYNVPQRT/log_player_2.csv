"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $100,000 while she gets $900,000 of the $1,000,000. This is a 10-90 split in her favor.

While I don't face inflation pressure (0% inflation for me), I should try to maximize my share. Since we're only in round 1 of a possible 12 rounds, I have plenty of opportunities to make counteroffers. If I reject now, I can propose a more favorable division in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer to Alice while acknowledging that we both need to come to an agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money. This gives us each $500,000, which is equitable and allows us both to walk away with a significant amount. This seems like a reasonable compromise that respects both of our interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 280000 
# Alice gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this new situation carefully. Alice has rejected my 50-50 split and is now offering me $280,000 while she takes $720,000. 

Importantly, I've learned that Alice faces 36% inflation since the first round. This means her $720,000 is actually worth only about $460,800 in round 1 value to her (720,000 Ã— 0.64), while my $280,000 retains full value since I don't face inflation.

This offer gives me more than Alice's first offer, moving from $100,000 to $280,000. However, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal given that Alice's inflation pressure increases with each round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now that I better understand Alice's situation with increasing inflation pressure, I can make a more strategic offer.

{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000}

I'm proposing I receive $400,000 and Alice receives $600,000. This is a more balanced offer that acknowledges Alice's inflation concerns while still improving my position from her previous offer. With her 36% inflation rate, her $600,000 would be worth approximately $384,000 in round 1 value to her. This seems fair to both of us, as we both get meaningful portions of the money, and accounts for our different inflation situations."
