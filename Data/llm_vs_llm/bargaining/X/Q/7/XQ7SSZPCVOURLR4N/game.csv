700000.0,300000.0,"Hi Bob! Since we both lose if we don't reach an agreement within 12 rounds, I'm proposing a 70-30 split. This is fair considering inflation affects you more than me with each round. If you counter with a better offer for yourself now, I'd have incentive to reject and counter later when your money is worth less to you.",Alice,1,
