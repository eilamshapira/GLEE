"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll analyze this situation carefully. 

Bob loses 20% of the value with each round, while I (Alice) lose 0%. This asymmetric pressure means Bob has stronger incentives to settle early.

For Bob in round 1, $1 is worth $1
For Bob in round 2, $1 is worth $0.80
For Bob in round 3, $1 is worth $0.64
...and so on

I should offer a division that recognizes this dynamic but remains fair enough that Bob accepts rather than countering.

""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since we both lose if we don't reach an agreement within 12 rounds, I'm proposing a 70-30 split. This is fair considering inflation affects you more than me with each round. If you counter with a better offer for yourself now, I'd have incentive to reject and counter later when your money is worth less to you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the impact of inflation. However, a 70/30 split is too generous to you. This offer is a much fairer split. Take it or leave it, you can make more money for yourself only if I accept it. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Bob's offer carefully, considering our bargaining positions.

Bob has offered me $520,000 while taking $480,000 for himself. This is a more balanced split than my initial offer, but I still have the advantage of being immune to inflation. 

If I reject now, I can make a counteroffer in Round 3, where Bob's purchasing power will decrease further (his money will be worth only 64% of the original value). This gives me leverage to potentially get a better deal.

However, I should also consider that:
1. $520,000 is a substantial amount
2. Continued negotiation carries some risk
3. Bob might be stubborn and we could end up with nothing if we don't reach agreement

Given the significant amount I'm being offered and the reasonable nature of Bob's proposal, I'll accept.
