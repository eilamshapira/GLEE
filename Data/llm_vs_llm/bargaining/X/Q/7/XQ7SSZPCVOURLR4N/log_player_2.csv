"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since we both lose if we don't reach an agreement within 12 rounds, I'm proposing a 70-30 split. This is fair considering inflation affects you more than me with each round. If you counter with a better offer for yourself now, I'd have incentive to reject and counter later when your money is worth less to you. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
