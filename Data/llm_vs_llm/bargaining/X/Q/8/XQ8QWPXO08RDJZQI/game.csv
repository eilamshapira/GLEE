9999.0,1.0,"Hi Bob – here’s my proposal for an efficient resolution. Given that my dollars retain full value each round while yours depreciate 5% with every delay, I'd like to settle now. I’m asking for $9999 and offering you $1. In a fully rational world, you’d be indifferent between waiting (with further depreciation) or accepting this tiny amount now. Let’s avoid any unnecessary loss – what do you say?",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, I understand your advantage. However, I believe a fair split is reasonable given the significant drop in value I face each round. Let's meet in the middle and avoid prolonging this negotiation.",Bob,2,

9999.0,1.0,"Bob, with each round the value of your money erodes—even more so as we approach future rounds. If you reject this offer, you'll become the proposer next round, but you'll be forced to concede almost the entire pot to me to get my agreement, leaving you with virtually nothing after further depreciation. By accepting $1 now (which at the current round is worth 10% less than nominally, but still more than your best alternative), you secure a positive payoff. Let's end this swiftly and avoid further losses.",Alice,3,

9900.0,100.0,"Alice, I understand your position, but I need to secure more value from this negotiation. I'm willing to accept a smaller share, but let's make it worthwhile for both of us to agree now.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to finalize the deal, I must decline your offer. With the money retaining its full value on my side, I can secure an even more advantageous division in the forthcoming round. As you’re aware, the depreciation on your side only worsens with time, and I can propose terms that maximize my share even further. Let’s continue to negotiate until we find a mutually agreeable resolution.",Alice,4,reject
9890.0,110.0,"Bob, I know the negotiation has been a tug-of-war—and with every round, your dollars lose more of their punch. Waiting until round 6 means you'll face even steeper inflation penalties. That's why I'm offering you $110 now (while I keep $9890), slightly better than your last proposal. Accepting this deal today secures you more value than risking further loss in the next round. Let's seal this agreement before further depreciation takes its toll.",Alice,5,
