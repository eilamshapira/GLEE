"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid the 20% discount in future rounds and secure value for both of us, I propose that I receive $55 and you receive $45. I believe this split fairly recognizes the benefits of closing the deal now. Looking forward to your acceptance! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, since we're now in round 2 and the value has decreased, I propose a split of $55 for me and $45 for you. This way, we can still secure a good amount before the value drops further. What do you think?""}"
