"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer of an even split, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher gain. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, so let's try 55/45 in your favor this time. I think this balances out our interests well. What do you think, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

It's getting riskier with the inflation, and Alice's offer is now reasonably close to my initial proposal. Accepting ensures I get a decent amount, even after the inflation hit."
