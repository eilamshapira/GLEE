"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer considering the inflation effect on my gains. Given that with each passing round, the money is worth 10% less for me, I should be a bit more aggressive in the first round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose a slightly higher share for myself since delaying would cost me value due to inflation. This is still quite fair, giving Bob a substantial portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
