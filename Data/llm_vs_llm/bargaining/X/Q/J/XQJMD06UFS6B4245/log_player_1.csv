"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair for both""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I need more than half to compensate for the inflation risk. This offer considers that. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

To calculate the actual value I'd get, I'll multiply the offered amount by 0.8 (1 - 0.2 inflation):

4500 * 0.8 = 3600

Considering this, I think I can try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in each round, I've already lost 20% + 20% = 36% of its value (1 - 0.8 * 0.8). To compensate for this, I'll try to get a bit more.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is my best offer""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering inflation, I need at least 5400. Let's settle with this offer. 
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer.

To calculate the actual value I'd get, I'll multiply the offered amount by (1 - 0.488):

4600 * (1 - 0.488) = 4600 * 0.512 = 2355.2

This is a significant reduction in value. However, I should also consider that if I reject this offer, the value will decrease even further in the next round.

Given the substantial loss in value already, I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risking further inflation.
