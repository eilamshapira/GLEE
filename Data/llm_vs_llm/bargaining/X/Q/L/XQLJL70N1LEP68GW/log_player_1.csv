"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by offering a fair division considering the inflation effect on my end.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I propose a slightly higher amount for myself to account for the 5% inflation penalty I'll face in future rounds if we don't reach an agreement now. This is a fair division that gives you a substantial portion while protecting me from inflation effects."
