"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer. Since Bob faces a 5% depreciation per round while I don't, I can use this to my advantage. However, I don't want to be too aggressive and risk rejection.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is still a substantial amount for Bob ($400,000), and if he rejects it, his next round's money will be worth 5% less to him. This makes accepting this offer more attractive than waiting for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $400,000 (full value)
   * Bob gets $600,000 (at 95% value = $570,000 effective value to him)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make a new offer
   * Bob's value will decrease another 5%
   * I maintain full value
   * I maintain negotiating power

This offer gives Bob a significantly larger share while my money maintains full value. I can make a better counter-offer next round, and Bob's time pressure (due to his inflation) gives me leverage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since we're now in round 3, Bob's money has depreciated by 10% from the original value. I'll use this to make a strategic offer that accounts for this depreciation while still being potentially acceptable to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

I'm proposing a 65-35 split. Here's why this is reasonable:
- For Bob, the $350,000 is now worth effectively $315,000 (90% of original value)
- If Bob rejects this, in the next round his money will be worth only 85% of original value
- The depreciation pressure on Bob makes this offer more attractive than waiting
- It's still a substantial amount of money for Bob"
