"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is close to fair, and considering that inflation affects me more than you, this slight advantage helps balance that out. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose value, so it's best to reach an agreement quickly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split the money evenly. We both get $50, and we avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our earnings.  It's the fairest and safest option. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
