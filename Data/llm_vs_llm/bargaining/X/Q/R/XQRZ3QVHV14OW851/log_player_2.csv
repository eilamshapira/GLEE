"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is close to fair, and considering that inflation affects me more than you, this slight advantage helps balance that out. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose value, so it's best to reach an agreement quickly. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
