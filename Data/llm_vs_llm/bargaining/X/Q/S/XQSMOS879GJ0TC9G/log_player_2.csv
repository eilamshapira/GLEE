"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's keep this simple. I offer $60 for me and $40 for you. It's a fair split considering I'll make the first move. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer gives me $40
2. If I reject, next round I can make an offer, but:
   * The money will be worth 10% less (so $100 becomes $90 in total value)
   * My maximum potential gain would be less than $90
   * Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation

While $40 isn't an ideal split, it's still a reasonable offer considering:
- I avoid the 10% inflation penalty
- I get a guaranteed payment
- Further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes if Alice is stubborn
