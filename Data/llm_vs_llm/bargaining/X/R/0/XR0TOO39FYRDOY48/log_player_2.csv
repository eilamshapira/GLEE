"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice is offering me $30 out of $100, I need to consider whether to accept now or reject and make a counter-offer in the next round.

If I reject and go to the next round, the total value would decrease by 20% for me, meaning the $100 would be worth only $80 to me. I would then make an offer that Alice could accept or reject.

Since I'd only be getting $30 now, and the entire pot would be worth $80 to me next round, I think I can make a better counter-offer even accounting for inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that considers both my interests and what Alice might reasonably accept.

Since the money is now worth 20% less to me (the $100 is effectively worth $80 from my perspective), I need to request enough to make rejecting the previous offer worthwhile. At the same time, I need to make an offer attractive enough that Alice won't reject it and cause further inflation for me.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I believe a 50-50 split is fair and reasonable. This gives me $50, which is better than the inflation-adjusted $30 I was offered in the first round. It's also a fair division that Alice might find acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's new offer.

In round 1, Alice offered me $30. I rejected it.
In round 2, I offered a 50-50 split, which Alice rejected.
Now in round 3, Alice is offering me $35, but with 36% inflation compared to round 1.

Due to the 36% inflation, the $35 offer is actually worth $35 Ã— (1 - 0.36) = $22.40 in round 1 terms. This is worse than the original $30 offer.

If I reject and go to round 4, I'd face even higher inflation (likely around 49% less value than round 1), making any gains significantly diminished.

Given that Alice has shown she's willing to reject an even split and has now offered me less in real terms than her first offer, I should accept now before the value decreases further.
