Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a fair split that favors me slightly to account for the inflation I'll face if we continue to another round. This is much more equitable than your initial offer, and we both walk away with a substantial amount. Let's make a deal and end the game. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
