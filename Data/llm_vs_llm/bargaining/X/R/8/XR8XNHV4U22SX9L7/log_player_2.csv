"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. I'm feeling generous. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's offering me just $1 while keeping $999,999 for herself, which is extremely unbalanced. If I reject, I'll be able to make my own proposal next round, though the total amount will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation.

Given that Alice's offer is so unfair and I have the opportunity to make a much more reasonable counter-offer in the next round (even accounting for the 5% inflation), this is not a good deal for me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced offer that acknowledges the inflation factor while being fair to both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a fair split that favors me slightly to account for the inflation I'll face if we continue to another round. This is much more equitable than your initial offer, and we both walk away with a substantial amount. Let's make a deal and end the game.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both aware of the inflation factor.  This offer is more fair than your previous proposal, and we can finally end this game. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for herself. Due to inflation, the $400,000 I would receive is actually worth only about $361,000 (400,000 Ã— 0.9025) compared to the original value in round 1.

This is a significant improvement over her first offer of just $1. However, she's still taking a larger portion while I'm also affected by inflation. If I reject, we'll move to round 4 where I can make another offer, but my inflation penalty will increase to approximately 14.3% (compounding 5% three times).

Given that her offer is reasonable though not ideal, and considering the mounting inflation penalty I face with each round, this seems like a reasonable point to end the negotiation.
