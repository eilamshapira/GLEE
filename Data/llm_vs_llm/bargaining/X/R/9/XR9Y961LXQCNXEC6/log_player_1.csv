"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Let me think through this carefully. With each round, the money is worth less to both of us, but the depreciation rate is different:
- For me (Alice): 5% less each round
- For Bob: 20% less each round

This means Bob has a stronger incentive to agree earlier than I do. However, we both lose if we don't reach an agreement in 12 rounds.

I'll start with a fair but strategic opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 55/45 split which is quite fair. Note that money depreciates much faster for you (20% per round) than for me (5%), so it's in your interest to accept early. If we wait too long, we both lose. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 50/50 split is the most equitable solution for both of us. This way, we both benefit equally. I hope you understand and agree to this proposal. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Let me recalculate my strategy. Bob wants a 50/50 split, but I need to emphasize the asymmetric inflation rates more clearly.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for equality, but our situation isn't symmetric. Due to the 20% depreciation rate for you versus my 5%, waiting is much costlier for you. At round 3, my $600K is worth $600K*(0.95)² ≈ $541K to me, while your $400K is worth $400K*(0.8)² ≈ $256K to you. If we reach round 12, you'd get almost nothing. A 60/40 split now maximizes our combined value. The longer we negotiate, the less we both get.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about the depreciation rates. However, I believe a slightly adjusted offer closer to 50/50 is fairer for both of us considering the collaborative spirit of this negotiation. My offer of 48/52 still respects the fact that time is more costly for me, while recognizing the gains we both can still achieve if we act swiftly. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this offer carefully.

If I accept Bob's offer of 520,000 for me and 480,000 for Bob at round 4:
- My actual value: $520,000 × (0.95)³ ≈ $520,000 × 0.8574 ≈ $445,848
- Bob's actual value: $480,000 × (0.8)³ ≈ $480,000 × 0.512 ≈ $245,760

If I reject and we continue to round 5, we'd have another exchange of offers. Given Bob's movement from 50/50 to 52/48, he's showing willingness to compromise.

However, with each round, Bob's position weakens significantly more than mine due to the higher depreciation rate. Going to round 5 gives me leverage to potentially get a better offer in round 6.

Still, there's the risk of the entire negotiation failing if we reach round 12 without agreement.

Since Bob has already moved in my direction and the diminishing returns are significant for both of us, I'll accept this offer.
