"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 55/45 split which is quite fair. Note that money depreciates much faster for you (20% per round) than for me (5%), so it's in your interest to accept early. If we wait too long, we both lose. Let's make a deal now and both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 50/50 split is the most equitable solution for both of us. This way, we both benefit equally. I hope you understand and agree to this proposal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for equality, but our situation isn't symmetric. Due to the 20% depreciation rate for you versus my 5%, waiting is much costlier for you. At round 3, my $600K is worth $600K*(0.95)² ≈ $541K to me, while your $400K is worth $400K*(0.8)² ≈ $256K to you. If we reach round 12, you'd get almost nothing. A 60/40 split now maximizes our combined value. The longer we negotiate, the less we both get. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point about the depreciation rates. However, I believe a slightly adjusted offer closer to 50/50 is fairer for both of us considering the collaborative spirit of this negotiation. My offer of 48/52 still respects the fact that time is more costly for me, while recognizing the gains we both can still achieve if we act swiftly.""}"
