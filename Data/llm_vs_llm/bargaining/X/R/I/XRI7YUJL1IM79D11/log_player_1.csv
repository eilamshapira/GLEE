"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to conclude quickly, and you'll get a substantial $4000 right now rather than risking value loss through inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50-50 split. I believe it's a fair offer that gives us both an equal share. Let's agree and move forward! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $5000, but due to 20% inflation, it's only worth $4000 to me
   * Bob gets $5000 at full value

2. If I reject and make a counter-offer:
   * In the next round, my money will be worth another 20% less
   * I might get a larger share, but it would need to be significantly larger to offset the inflation
   * There's no guarantee Bob would accept my counter-offer

While the 50-50 split seems fair on the surface, with the inflation effect, I'm actually getting less value than Bob. However, rejecting might lead to an even worse outcome due to further inflation.
