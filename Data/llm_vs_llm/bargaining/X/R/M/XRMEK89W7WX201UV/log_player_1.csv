"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1, keeping in mind the potential for inflation and the limited number of rounds:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning is that this offer gives me a slight advantage, but still offers Bob a substantial amount. Hopefully, this will be enough to incentivize him to accept the deal in the first round and avoid any value decay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation and the risk of further delays. My initial offer was rejected, and Bob is now asking for a larger share. Let's analyze:

*   **Bob's Offer:** He wants $5500, I get $4500.
*   **Inflation Impact:** My $4500 is worth 20% less than it would have been in round 1. Therefore, the actual value of the offer for me is $4500 * (1 - 0.20) = $3600. Bob's $5500 is worth 10% less, so for him it is $5500 * (1 - 0.10) = $4950.

While $3600 is less than ideal, if I reject, the money continues to lose value for *both* of us. He might make a worse offer next round. Let's see the values after another round of inflation.

If I reject and he accepts my next offer (assuming I get say 5000):
For round 3: value of 5000 after 2 rounds of inflation: $5000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $3200.
Therefore, I will take the 3600 now.
