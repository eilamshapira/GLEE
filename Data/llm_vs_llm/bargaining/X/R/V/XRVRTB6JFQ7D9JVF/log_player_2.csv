"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer.

*   **Bob's Gain:** \$4000
*   **Alice's Gain:** \$6000

Since I am Bob, I need to consider whether \$4000 is a fair amount, especially considering there will be inflation in the next round if I reject. The money will worth 5% less in the next round.

It's best to reject since this is the first round. I can try to get more money from Alice.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to propose the division. I want to get a good deal for myself, but I also need to make an offer that Alice is likely to accept to avoid further inflation. I think I'll propose a slightly more balanced split, favoring me a bit.

```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Alice is offering a 50/50 split. I need to consider the inflation. The money is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

While I initially aimed for more, a 50/50 split isn't terrible, and rejecting it carries the risk of further inflation. It's probably the most reasonable option now.
