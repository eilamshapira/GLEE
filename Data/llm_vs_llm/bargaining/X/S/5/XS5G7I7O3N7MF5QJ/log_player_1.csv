"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide $1,000,000 with Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor since I know I face 20% inflation each round, which significantly reduces the value of future payments for me. This is a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while protecting my interests against inflation."
