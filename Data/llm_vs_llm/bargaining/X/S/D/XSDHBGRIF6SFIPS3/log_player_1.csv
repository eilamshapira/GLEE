"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair Alice. This split accounts for the decreasing value and ensures we both get a reasonable amount.  I took a hit in round 1 hoping for a better deal.  If you reject, we both lose out in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
