"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me $4,000, which is less than half of the total amount, I need to consider the 5% inflation penalty per round. If I reject now and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will already be reduced by 5%.

Let me analyze this: $4,000 now is better than a potentially higher amount several rounds later after significant inflation has reduced the overall value. For example, after just 3 more rounds, even if I got $5,000, it would be worth less than $4,000 now due to the 15% cumulative inflation.
