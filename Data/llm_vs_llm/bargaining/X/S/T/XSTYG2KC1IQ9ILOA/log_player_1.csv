"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","As Alice, I'll make a fair first offer to Bob, recognizing that we both need to reach an agreement within 12 rounds, and each round reduces the money's value.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a simple 50-50 split of the $1,000,000. This is fair and equal, giving us both the same amount. Since we face declining value with each round, it makes sense to agree quickly rather than engage in lengthy negotiations that would reduce the total value for both of us."
