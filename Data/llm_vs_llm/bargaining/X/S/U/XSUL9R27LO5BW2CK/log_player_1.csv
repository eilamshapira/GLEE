"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Based on a backwards‐induction analysis of the negotiation rounds (using multiplicative discount factors of 0.95 per round for me and 0.80 per round for Bob), a roughly “equilibrium” offer in round 1 is for me (Alice) to claim about 67.27 dollars and leave Bob about 32.73 dollars. (If Bob rejects, then in the following rounds his “proposer power” is tempered by his steeper discount: his money loses 20% per round, so his continuation “value” in round 2 would be roughly 32.73 in today’s dollars.)

Below is my proposal in the requested JSON format:

{""alice_gain"": 67.27, ""bob_gain"": 32.73}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Based on the idea that—as the rounds progress—you (Alice) still have a comparative “patience advantage” (losing only 5% per round relative to Bob’s 20%), I want to propose a split that gives Bob just enough (when we account for his heavier discounting at this stage) so that he is barely indifferent between accepting now and waiting to propose in round 4.

One way to think about this (roughly speaking) is to try to “preserve” the same effective ratio that we saw in our round‑1 analysis. In round 1 we ended up with an offer where nominally Alice got about 67.27 and Bob about 32.73. In effective terms (with no discounting in round 1) that was a ratio of about 2.06 : 1 in Alice’s favor.

Now in round 3 the nominal dollars are “worth less.” In round 3 your (Alice’s) money is worth 0.95² ≈ 0.9025 per dollar, while Bob’s money is worth 0.8² = 0.64 per dollar. In other words, if you were to get x dollars in nominal terms on round 3, your effective value would be about 0.9025·x, and if Bob gets 100 – x dollars, his effective value is 0.64·(100 – x).

If we try to maintain roughly the same effective ratio of about 2.06 : 1 (that is, Alice’s effective amount divided by Bob’s effective amount) then we want

  (0.9025·x) / [0.64·(100 – x)] ≈ 2.06.

Solving this:
  0.9025·x ≈ 2.06 · 0.64 · (100 – x)  
  0.9025·x ≈ 1.3184 · (100 – x)  
  0.9025·x ≈ 131.84 – 1.3184·x  
  0.9025·x + 1.3184·x ≈ 131.84  
  2.2209·x ≈ 131.84  
  x ≈ 59.3

Thus, an approximate proposal is to take about $59.30 for you (Alice) and give Bob about $40.70 nominally. In effective terms at round 3 this means:
  Alice’s effective value ≈ 59.3 · 0.9025 ≈ 53.6  
  Bob’s effective value ≈ 40.7 · 0.64 ≈ 26.0

This offer gives Bob roughly the “just‐acceptable” effective value he might expect if he waited (remembering that further rounds incur even heavier discounts for him). It’s not a huge concession—after all, his money devalues fast—and it makes use of your comparative advantage.

Here is my proposal in the requested JSON format:

{""alice_gain"": 59.3, ""bob_gain"": 40.7}"
