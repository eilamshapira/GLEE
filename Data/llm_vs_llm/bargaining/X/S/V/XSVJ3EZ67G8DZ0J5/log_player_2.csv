"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

This is a fair 50-50 split, but I need to consider that if I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject now:
- Current offer: $50
- Next round value: $50 * 0.95 = $47.50

Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, I'll already be at a disadvantage due to the inflation. The 50-50 split is fair, and avoiding inflation makes it the most rational choice.
