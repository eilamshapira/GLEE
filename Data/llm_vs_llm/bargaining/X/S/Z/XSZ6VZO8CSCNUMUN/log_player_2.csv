"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally to start. It's fair and ensures we both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice has offered a 50-50 split, which is perfectly fair and reasonable. While I could reject and try to negotiate for more, there's significant risk in doing so:

1. We have a limited number of rounds (12)
2. If we fail to reach an agreement, we both get nothing
3. The current offer is already fair and substantial ($500,000)
4. By accepting now, we avoid the risk of deteriorating negotiations

Given these factors, accepting a fair split in the first round is actually a strong position. It's both fair and efficient.
