550000.0,450000.0,I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more since inflation affects me more heavily than you. This way we both benefit from making a deal early.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This accounts for the higher inflation you face while still being a fair deal considering the risk of us both losing money with each passing round.,Bob,2,
