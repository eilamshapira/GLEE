"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more since inflation affects me more heavily than you. This way we both benefit from making a deal early.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This accounts for the higher inflation you face while still being a fair deal considering the risk of us both losing money with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept, I get $400,000 at 80% value = $320,000 effective value
- If I reject and we continue:
  - Next round my money will be worth 60% (another 20% drop)
  - Bob's money will be worth 90% (another 5% drop)
  - The risk of further devaluation is significant

While this isn't ideal, the rapid 20% inflation rate working against me means I should probably accept now rather than risk further devaluation. If I reject, I'd need to secure a much larger share next round just to break even.
