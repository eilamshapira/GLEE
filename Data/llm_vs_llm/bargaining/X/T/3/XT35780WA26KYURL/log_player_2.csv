"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer of a 50-50 split, dividing the $1,000,000 equally between us.

This is a completely fair division that gives each of us $500,000. In these ultimatum games, equal splits are generally considered the most fair outcome, and there's no strategic advantage to rejecting a fair offer only to make the same offer later.
