"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I propose a 70/30 split. I think this is a fair offer, considering we have to act fast. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, taking inflation into account, I revise my offer. Let's go with 65/35.  We need to lock this in before things get worse for me. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I need to hold firm for a better offer.  While the difference is smaller now due to inflation, accepting 35% when I was aiming for 55% sets a bad precedent for future rounds. Alice might be bluffing about the inflation affecting her side."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair deal.  We're both losing money as time goes on.  Let's be reasonable and close this out."" 
}
```

I'm lowering my ask slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate.  However, I'm holding relatively firm to signal I'm serious about getting a significant share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's try again.  How about 60/40? I'm feeling the inflation pressure, so this is my final offer to secure a reasonable amount. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a tough one, but I'm still rejecting.  Alice is using strong language (""final offer""), which suggests she might be getting anxious. I'm betting she'll fold further if I hold out, even though my potential gains are eroding."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome here.  Take it before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""
}
```

I'm going for a bold move here, aiming for an even split. This might seem risky, but it signals that I'm willing to risk it all for a fair deal. Alice's ""final offer"" bluff suggests she's getting nervous, and my firm stance might push her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, okay, last chance. I'll go with 55/45. We're both losing more and more each round.  Please accept this. This is as good as it gets for me. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is it. While not ideal, this offer is better than anything I can realistically expect at this point.  Accepting now secures a decent sum before inflation eats further into the potential gains.  Alice seems genuinely desperate, so pushing further is unlikely to result in a better outcome."
