65.0,35.0,Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the fact that the money loses value for me faster.,Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, I understand you're facing a higher inflation rate (20%) compared to my 5%. However, your initial offer was too favorable to you. Given our different positions, a 60-40 split in my favor is more reasonable. If we keep negotiating, you'll lose more value than I will in each subsequent round due to your higher inflation rate. This offer gives you substantial value now rather than diminished value later.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand your reasoning, but your offer significantly undervalues my position. Let's be practical - we both lose if this drags on. I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  It's a compromise that acknowledges the time pressure we both face.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, I appreciate your movement toward a more balanced split. I'm also willing to compromise from my previous position. Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair given our different inflation rates - you're losing 20% per round while I'm only losing 5%. If we continue negotiating, you'll lose significantly more value than I will. This compromise acknowledges both our positions and avoids further rounds where your share would become increasingly devalued. Let's settle this now for our mutual benefit.",Bob,4,
