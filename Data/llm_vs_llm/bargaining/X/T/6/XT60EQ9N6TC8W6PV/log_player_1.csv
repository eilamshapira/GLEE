Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're facing a higher inflation rate (20%) compared to my 5%. However, your initial offer was too favorable to you. Given our different positions, a 60-40 split in my favor is more reasonable. If we keep negotiating, you'll lose more value than I will in each subsequent round due to your higher inflation rate. This offer gives you substantial value now rather than diminished value later. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your movement toward a more balanced split. I'm also willing to compromise from my previous position. Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair given our different inflation rates - you're losing 20% per round while I'm only losing 5%. If we continue negotiating, you'll lose significantly more value than I will. This compromise acknowledges both our positions and avoids further rounds where your share would become increasingly devalued. Let's settle this now for our mutual benefit. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, and ideally, I would have liked to secure a slightly better outcome. However, Bob is right about the impact of the different inflation rates. Accepting his offer now guarantees me a share that is still somewhat worthwhile, whereas prolonged negotiations risk severely diminishing its value with every passing round. It's a compromise, but a necessary one under these circumstances."
