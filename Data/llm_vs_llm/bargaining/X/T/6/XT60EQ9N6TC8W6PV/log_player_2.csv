"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the fact that the money loses value for me faster. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $35 out of $100, which means she keeps $65.

Given the inflation rates:
- For me, money loses 5% value per round
- For Alice, money loses 20% value per round

Since Alice's inflation rate is much higher than mine, waiting will hurt her more than it hurts me. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round when the total value has decreased, but it will have decreased more for her than for me.

I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer and making my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges our different inflation rates but is more favorable to me.

{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand you're facing a higher inflation rate (20%) compared to my 5%. However, your initial offer was too favorable to you. Given our different positions, a 60-40 split in my favor is more reasonable. If we keep negotiating, you'll lose more value than I will in each subsequent round due to your higher inflation rate. This offer gives you substantial value now rather than diminished value later.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your reasoning, but your offer significantly undervalues my position. Let's be practical - we both lose if this drags on. I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  It's a compromise that acknowledges the time pressure we both face. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully. She's now offering me $45 out of $100, which is better than her initial offer of $35, but still less than my proposal of $60.

Considering our inflation rates:
- For me: 9.75% total inflation so far (5% per round)
- For Alice: 36% total inflation so far (20% per round)

If we continue negotiating, Alice will lose value much faster than I will. However, she's made a significant concession from her initial position, moving from 35/65 to 45/55.

Given that we have limited rounds and her inflation rate is much higher, she's under more pressure to reach an agreement. I believe I can still get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your movement toward a more balanced split. I'm also willing to compromise from my previous position. Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair given our different inflation rates - you're losing 20% per round while I'm only losing 5%. If we continue negotiating, you'll lose significantly more value than I will. This compromise acknowledges both our positions and avoids further rounds where your share would become increasingly devalued. Let's settle this now for our mutual benefit.""}"
