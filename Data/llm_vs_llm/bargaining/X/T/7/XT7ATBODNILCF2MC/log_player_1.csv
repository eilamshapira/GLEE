"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

This offer reflects that I am aware of the inflation working against me.  I am aiming for a larger share while still offering Bob a reasonable amount to avoid going to further rounds where the value decreases."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is heavily skewed in his favor, especially considering the inflation working against him. I believe I have a stronger negotiating position than this offer reflects."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I am reducing my demand slightly from the first round, acknowledging the decreased value due to inflation.  This offer is still advantageous to me while giving Bob a better share than his previous offer."
