"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's offering me $350,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 35% of the total. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but I need to remember that inflation will make the money worth 10% less to me.

If I reject, the $1,000,000 will effectively be worth $900,000 to me in the next round. I'd need to secure more than $350,000/$900,000 = 38.9% of the remaining value to come out ahead.

Since this first offer gives me 35% which is less than what I would need to break even considering inflation, I should make a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since I face 10% inflation per round and Alice faces 5% inflation, I should propose a division that incentivizes acceptance now rather than delaying.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a more balanced split that gives me a slight advantage but is still reasonable. This recognizes that I face higher inflation risk than Alice, so reaching an agreement sooner is especially important for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer considering the inflation that has occurred.

Due to inflation, the money is now worth 19% less to me than in round 1. So $400,000 now is equivalent to $400,000 Ã— 0.81 = $324,000 of round 1 value for me.

Alice's first offer gave me $350,000. So this new offer, when adjusted for inflation, is actually worth less to me than her initial offer.

If I reject and move to round 4, I'll face another 10% inflation (on top of the current 19%), making the money worth 27.1% less than original value. If I want to do better than the current equivalent of $324,000, I would need to secure more than that proportion in the next round.

Given that Alice has only increased her offer slightly despite knowing my counter-offer, and considering the significant inflation penalty I face, I'll accept this offer rather than risk further devaluation.
