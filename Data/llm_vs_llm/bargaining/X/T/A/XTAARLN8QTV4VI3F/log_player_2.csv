"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest we split it evenly - it's fair and we both benefit equally. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer and the impact of inflation on future rounds.

Alice is offering an even split of $5,000 each. While this appears fair at first glance, I need to remember that inflation will reduce the value of my money by 20% each round. If I reject this offer and we go to the next round, the $10,000 will effectively be worth $8,000 to me, making my maximum possible gain in round 2 lower than what I'm being offered now.

Since I'm being offered $5,000 in this first round with no inflation impact yet, and waiting would reduce my potential maximum, I should accept this fair offer.
