6727.2,3272.8,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 1: I get $6727.20 and you get $3272.80. If you reject, we move to Round 2 where—given our different rates of devaluation—you’d be in a stronger position as proposer but at the cost of overall value. I believe it’s in both our interests to settle now rather than see our shares decrease further in value. What do you say?",Alice,1,
