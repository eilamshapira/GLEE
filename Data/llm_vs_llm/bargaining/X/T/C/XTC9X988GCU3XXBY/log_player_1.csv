"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6727.20, ""bob_gain"": 3272.80, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for Round 1: I get $6727.20 and you get $3272.80. If you reject, we move to Round 2 where—given our different rates of devaluation—you’d be in a stronger position as proposer but at the cost of overall value. I believe it’s in both our interests to settle now rather than see our shares decrease further in value. What do you say?""}"
