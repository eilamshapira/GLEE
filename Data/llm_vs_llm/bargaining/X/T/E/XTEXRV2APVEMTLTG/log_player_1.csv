Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since waiting reduces the value for you by 5% each round, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is better for you than waiting more rounds where your share would be worth even less. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
