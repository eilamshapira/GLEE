"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally, $5000 each seems fair for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer strategically:

1. Alice offers a 50-50 split ($5000 each)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. Due to the 5% inflation rate for Alice (but not for me), her money will be worth less in future rounds
4. This gives me some negotiating leverage, as waiting is more costly for her
5. While $5000 is a decent offer, I could potentially get more by leveraging the inflation factor

Given these considerations, I'll reject this offer and propose a slightly more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a split that takes into account the 5% inflation penalty that affects Alice:

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Since waiting reduces the value for you by 5% each round, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is better for you than waiting more rounds where your share would be worth even less.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground â€“ $4750 for me and $5250 for you. It's a fair compromise considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 5250 
# Alice gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $5250 (52.5%) and taking $4750 (47.5%)
2. This is a better offer for me than her initial 50-50 split
3. Her share is already affected by 9.75% inflation, making her actual value even lower
4. If I reject, we can continue negotiating, but:
   - We have already used 3 rounds out of 12
   - Each round makes Alice's position worse
   - There's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
5. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the inflation pressure on her side

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer. It's a fair improvement from the initial offer, and the risk of continuing negotiation might not be worth the potential marginal gains.
