Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation, I think a $55/$45 split is more reasonable. Let's settle on this before the money loses more value.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given the inflation, let's go for an even $50/$50 split. This ensures we both exit with an equal amount without further losses. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
