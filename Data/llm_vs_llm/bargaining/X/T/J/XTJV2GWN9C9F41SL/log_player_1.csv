"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Based on a simple Rubinstein‐style bargaining analysis with discounting (where your “patience” is represented by a discount factor of 0.8 per round and Bob’s by 0.9), the subgame‐perfect equilibrium in an alternating‐offer model tells us that as the proposer in round 1 you must offer Bob the “reservation” share he would secure if he waited to propose in round 2. Working through the derivation one finds that, if we normalize the pie to 1, your equilibrium share is

  Alice’s share = (1 – 0.9)/(1 – 0.8×0.9) ≈ 0.1/0.28 ≈ 35.7%

and Bob’s share is the remainder, about 64.3%.

Scaling these percentages to $1,000,000, the offer is approximately:

  Alice: $357,143
  Bob: $642,857

This offer gives Bob just as much (when accounting for his 10% discount in the next round) as he would get when making his own proposal later, so he should be willing to accept.

Here is my proposal in JSON:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 357143,
  ""bob_gain"": 642857
