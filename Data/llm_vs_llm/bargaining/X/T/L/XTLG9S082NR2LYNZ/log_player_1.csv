Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  This leaves us both with a decent share.

# Bob gain: 55

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting us nowhere. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this fairly.  Let's not lose any more to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a good time to accept.  Here's why:

* **Fair Deal:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair.
* **Inflation Impact:** While my gains remain unaffected, Bob's offer is becoming less valuable to him due to inflation. Accepting now secures a reasonable share for me.
* **Time Pressure:** We're already in round 4, and delaying further increases the risk of getting nothing."
