Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, but my previous offer was more than fair. Let's settle this now with a 55/45 split in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to take advantage of the situation, but I'm not going to accept an offer worse than my previous one, especially with inflation eating into my potential gains.  I need to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting us nowhere. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this fairly.  Let's not lose any more to inflation.""}"
