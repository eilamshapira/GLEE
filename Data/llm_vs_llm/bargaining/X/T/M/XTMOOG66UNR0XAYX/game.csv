500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair 50-50 split. This seems equitable to start with, and since inflation affects you more than me (10% vs 5%), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement early.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer in the previous round. While a 50-50 split sounds fair in principle, the inflation rate impacts me more significantly. I propose a 55%-45% split in my favor to account for this disparity. Let's try to reach an agreement quickly.",Bob,2,

520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about the higher inflation rate affecting you, but that's precisely why we should reach an agreement quickly. However, asking for more than 50% doesn't seem fair. Since inflation affects you more, I'm offering you a substantial portion (48%) that still preserves fairness while acknowledging the time pressure. Let's finalize this now before both our shares lose more value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
470000.0,530000.0,"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a split that acknowledges the inflation difference. However, 48% still represents a significant loss for me in the long run. I'm proposing 53% for me and 47% for you. This feels like a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses.",Bob,4,
