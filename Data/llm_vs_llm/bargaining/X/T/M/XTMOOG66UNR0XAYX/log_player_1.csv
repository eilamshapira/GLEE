Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer in the previous round. While a 50-50 split sounds fair in principle, the inflation rate impacts me more significantly. I propose a 55%-45% split in my favor to account for this disparity. Let's try to reach an agreement quickly.

# Bob gain: 550000

Let's finalize this now before both our shares lose more value.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a split that acknowledges the inflation difference. However, 48% still represents a significant loss for me in the long run. I'm proposing 53% for me and 47% for you. This feels like a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses.
