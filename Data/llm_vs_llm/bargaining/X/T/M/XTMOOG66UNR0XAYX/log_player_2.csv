Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair 50-50 split. This seems equitable to start with, and since inflation affects you more than me (10% vs 5%), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement early. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer in the previous round. While a 50-50 split sounds fair in principle, the inflation rate impacts me more significantly. I propose a 55%-45% split in my favor to account for this disparity. Let's try to reach an agreement quickly.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about the higher inflation rate affecting you, but that's precisely why we should reach an agreement quickly. However, asking for more than 50% doesn't seem fair. Since inflation affects you more, I'm offering you a substantial portion (48%) that still preserves fairness while acknowledging the time pressure. Let's finalize this now before both our shares lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000
