"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $4000 for me, $6000 for Alice
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me (my $4000 would become $3200)
   * The money will be worth 5% less to Alice (her $6000 would become $5700)
3. The difference in inflation rates puts me at a disadvantage in later rounds
4. While 40/60 split isn't ideal, getting less than $4000 in future rounds would be worse

Given the significant inflation penalty I face (20%), it's better to accept a somewhat unfavorable deal now than risk getting even less in future rounds.
