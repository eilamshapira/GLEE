"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we divide the $10000 as $6000 for me and $4000 for you. Let's secure a good amount for both of us before any inflation occurs. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer of $6000 for her and $4000 for me.

This is a 60-40 split in Alice's favor. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the total amount will be worth 10% less (only $9000 total value).

While the split isn't equal, $4000 is a substantial amount, and if I reject, the maximum I could get in the next round would be $5400 (60% of $9000) if Alice accepts my counter-offer.

Given the inflation penalty and the reasonable amount offered to me, I'll accept this offer.
