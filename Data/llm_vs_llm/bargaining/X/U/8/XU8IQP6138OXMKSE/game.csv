70.0,30.0,I think a 70/30 split is fair to start. Let's get this done!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I appreciate your offer, but I think a more balanced split would be fair. I'm proposing 55/45 in my favor since I'm affected by 10% inflation each round. This way we both get a good deal and can finish early.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"Okay, Bob, let's try this again. Considering the inflation on my side, I'm bumping up your share. How about 60/40? This is a good deal for both of us.",Alice,3,
