Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think a more balanced split would be fair. I'm proposing 55/45 in my favor since I'm affected by 10% inflation each round. This way we both get a good deal and can finish early. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
