"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 70/30 split is fair to start. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
- Alice is offering me $30 out of $100
- If I reject, the next round will have 10% inflation, so the total value to me would be $90
- In the next round, I could propose a better split
- However, Alice could reject my offer and we could enter a cycle of rejections
- $30 right now is better than risking getting nothing after 12 rounds

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering that Alice already showed willingness to negotiate:

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think a more balanced split would be fair. I'm proposing 55/45 in my favor since I'm affected by 10% inflation each round. This way we both get a good deal and can finish early.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again. Considering the inflation on my side, I'm bumping up your share. How about 60/40? This is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
- Alice is now offering me $40, but with 19% inflation, it's worth about $32.40 to me
- If I reject, next round will have 27.1% inflation for me
- Alice has increased my share from her initial offer (30 â†’ 40)
- She seems willing to negotiate but still wants a significant advantage
- The inflation is only affecting me, which puts me at a disadvantage
- $32.40 value now is better than risking further inflation and potential deadlock

{""decision"": ""accept""}

The offer is reasonable given the inflation pressure, and continuing to negotiate might lead to worse outcomes for me."
