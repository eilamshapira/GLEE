"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4500, but it's worth 10% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $4500 * 0.9 = $4050.

Since Bob's offer doesn't seem very favorable to me, and we have 10 more rounds to go, I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. For me, it's worth 10% less than in Round 2, which is 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value. For Bob, it's worth 20% less than in Round 2, which is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, I'm giving you a significant share considering the inflation""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, Alice.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $5000, but it's worth 27.1% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $5000 * (1 - 0.271) = $5000 * 0.729 = $3645.

A 50/50 split seems fair, and considering the significant decrease in value for both of us, it's a reasonable offer. I'll accept it to ensure we both get something.
