"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of the total $10,000, while she would get $6,000.

I should consider:
1. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
2. There's an inflation effect - money doesn't lose value for me, but loses 10% value for Alice each round
3. This gives me negotiating leverage as waiting is more costly for Alice

Since I can make a counter-offer in the next round, and Alice has more to lose from delay due to the 10% inflation on her side, I'll reject this first offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counteroffer that accounts for the inflation effect and creates a more favorable split for me while still being reasonable to Alice.

Since Alice faces 10% inflation per round and we're now in round 2, the $10,000 is worth 10% less to her. This gives me some leverage to negotiate a better deal, but I still want to propose something she's likely to accept rather than extending the game further.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering Alice $4,500, which acknowledges her time pressure due to inflation while giving me a majority share. This is a fair improvement from the initial offer, and considering the declining value for Alice with each round, she should find this reasonable."
