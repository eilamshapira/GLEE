"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob considering the fact that the money is worth less with each passing round - especially for me since I face a higher inflation rate.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split that acknowledges our different inflation rates. If we delay, I lose more value than you do with each round. This is a reasonable first offer that gives us both substantial value without the risk of further negotiations reducing our total gains.""}"
