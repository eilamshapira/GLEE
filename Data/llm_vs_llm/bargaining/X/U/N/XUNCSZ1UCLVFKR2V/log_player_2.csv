"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split that acknowledges our different inflation rates. If we delay, I lose more value than you do with each round. This is a reasonable first offer that gives us both substantial value without the risk of further negotiations reducing our total gains. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
