"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60 out of our $100. 

Since the problem mentions that with each passing round, money is worth 10% less for Alice but 0% less for me, I have an advantage in waiting. If I reject this offer, I can make a proposal next round where Alice's $60 would only be worth $54 to her (10% less), while my money wouldn't lose value.

This gives me negotiating leverage to potentially get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll now make a counter-offer. Taking into account that money loses 10% value each round for Alice but not for me, I can use this strategically.

Alice offered me $40 and herself $60. For her, waiting another round means her $60 would only be worth $54. I can use this to offer her slightly more than the present value of what she'd get next round, which would incentivize her to accept now.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally, with $50 each. This is fair and gives Alice more value now than if she rejects and we go to another round where her money would be worth even less."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully. She's now offering me $45 while she takes $55.

Let me consider the inflation effect: For Alice, the $55 she would get is actually worth only about $44.55 in round 1 value (after 19% inflation). Meanwhile, my $45 keeps its full value.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 4, her money will depreciate by another 10% (for a total of about 27% from the original value). This gives me some leverage, but I also need to consider that we might be approaching a reasonable middle ground.

Since Alice has increased her offer from $40 to $45 for me, which is moving in my direction, and the deal is becoming increasingly favorable due to inflation affecting only her portion, I'll accept this offer.
