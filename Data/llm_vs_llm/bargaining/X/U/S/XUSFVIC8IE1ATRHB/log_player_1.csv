"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my offer for the first round. Given the time constraints due to inflation, I should consider making a fair offer that Bob would likely accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. Since each round that passes makes the money worth 10% less to me but doesn't affect Bob's value, a fair division now is better than risking rejection and getting less in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to be strategic now, considering the inflation effect and Bob's previous behavior.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm offering Bob slightly more than a 50-50 split to make the offer more attractive. With each round, I lose 10% of value due to inflation, so it's in my interest to reach an agreement soon. This offer gives Bob more than half while still preserving a reasonable amount for me, accounting for the fact that I've already lost 20% of value due to inflation."
