"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer to Bob since we're both incentivized to reach an agreement, especially with the 10% inflation penalty for me in each round.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal split of the $100. This is fair to both of us and allows us to avoid the inflation penalty that would reduce the value of my share if we continue to later rounds."
