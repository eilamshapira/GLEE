"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 60-40 split in my favor. Remember that with each round, the money is worth 20% less to me due to inflation, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my position as the first mover. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
