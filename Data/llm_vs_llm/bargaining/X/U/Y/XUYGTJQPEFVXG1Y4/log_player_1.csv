"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Since Bob's money is worth 10% less in each round that passes, I'll take that into account in my proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering a slightly favorable split for myself, but still giving Bob a substantial amount. If Bob rejects this and we move to the next round, the total value will be worth less to him due to the 10% inflation on his side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more strategic offer considering that Bob's money is worth 10% less each round, and we're now in round 3.

{""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500}

Since Bob already rejected my first offer and offered me more in round 2, I'm adjusting my proposal to get a better deal while still giving Bob enough that it should be rational for him to accept given the inflation he faces."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6400 
# Bob gain: 3600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
