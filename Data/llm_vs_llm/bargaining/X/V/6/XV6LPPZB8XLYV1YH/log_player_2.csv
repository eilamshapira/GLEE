"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep a fair start. I propose 800000 for me and 200000 for you. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. The offer is $200,000 for me and $800,000 for Alice
2. If I reject, my next offer will be worth 20% less to me
3. The 80/20 split seems quite unfair, especially since I'll be affected by inflation in future rounds
4. In the next round, I can make a counter-offer and negotiate for a better deal
5. With 11 rounds remaining, I still have room to negotiate

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a more balanced offer:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us, and considering I'm affected by inflation in future rounds, it's a reasonable proposal.""}

This is a fair offer because:
1. It's an equal split
2. I'm the one affected by inflation, so a fair initial split is reasonable
3. It's a significant improvement from Alice's initial 80/20 split
4. It shows willingness to cooperate while standing firm on fairness"
