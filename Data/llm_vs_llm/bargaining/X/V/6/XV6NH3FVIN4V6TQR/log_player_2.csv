"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I propose we split it 55/45. I think this is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, considering we both want to secure a good portion of the money. Let's not risk losing it all! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 450,000$
2. If I reject, in the next round the money will be worth 5% less to me
3. While 55/45 split slightly favors Alice, it's a reasonable starting offer
4. With inflation risk and 12-round limit, getting a good deal early might be better than risking value loss
5. My counteroffer next round would be worth less due to 5% inflation
6. 450,000$ is still a substantial amount

While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of value deterioration and the decent initial offer make accepting a prudent choice.
