"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this extremely unfair offer where I get nothing. In the next round, I can make a more reasonable proposal that benefits both parties."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering that any further delay will cost me 5% due to inflation, while Alice faces no such penalty. This split gives both of us a substantial portion of the money, and it's better for Alice to accept now than to drag out negotiations where we both might end up with less."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this still extremely unfair offer where I would only get $1. Even with the 9.75% inflation penalty, it's worth making another proposal in the next round to try to get a more reasonable share. A $1 gain is practically nothing compared to Alice's $99, and I believe we can reach a more equitable arrangement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split for Alice compared to my previous offer, considering that any money I receive is now worth about 14.25% less due to inflation (after another round). This 55-45 split is still fair and should be attractive to both parties. If Alice rejects this and we continue further, the inflation penalty will keep reducing the real value of my share, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 0.01 
# Alice gain: 99.99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this essentially zero-sum offer from Alice. Even though I'm facing increasing inflation penalties (18.55% now), getting only 1 cent is still worse than trying another round. Alice seems to be playing very aggressively, but I'll try one more time with a more generous offer to reach a reasonable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm now offering a completely equal 50-50 split. Given that my share is worth about 22.8% less due to inflation in the next round, this is a very fair and reasonable offer. This proposal demonstrates my willingness to compromise and reach an equitable solution. Alice faces no inflation penalty, so accepting this even split would be beneficial for both of us rather than continuing this back-and-forth with increasingly devalued outcomes for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 0.01 
# Alice gain: 99.99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer, even though it's extremely unfair. It's clear that Alice is not willing to negotiate in good faith and will likely continue this pattern of offering virtually nothing. With the inflation penalty now at 26.49% and likely to grow even higher in future rounds, continuing to negotiate would only further decrease the real value of any potential future gains. While getting only 1 cent is far from ideal, it's better than potentially ending up with even less real value after more rounds of failed negotiations."
