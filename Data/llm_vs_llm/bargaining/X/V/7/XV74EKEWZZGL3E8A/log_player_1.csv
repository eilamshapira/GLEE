"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair considering that inflation affects me more heavily at 10% compared to your 5%. If we delay, both of us lose value, so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I rejected your offer because I believe a 50-50 split is fairer, especially since we're now in round 2. Although inflation affects you more, starting with an even split seems equitable. Let's agree on this to minimize our losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
