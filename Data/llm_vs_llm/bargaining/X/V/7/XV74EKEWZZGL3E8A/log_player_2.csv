"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a split where I get $55 and you get $45. This is fair considering that inflation affects me more heavily at 10% compared to your 5%. If we delay, both of us lose value, so it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I rejected your offer because I believe a 50-50 split is fairer, especially since we're now in round 2. Although inflation affects you more, starting with an even split seems equitable. Let's agree on this to minimize our losses due to inflation.""}"
