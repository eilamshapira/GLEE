6000.0,4000.0,Hi Bob! Let's keep it simple and fair. I propose I take $6000 and you take $4000. What do you think?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split would be most fair. We'd each get $5000. This is equitable and allows us both to walk away with a significant amount. Given the time pressure and inflation affecting me, I believe this is a reasonable compromise.",Bob,2,
