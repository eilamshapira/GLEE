"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! Let's keep it simple and fair. I propose I take $6000 and you take $4000. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split would be most fair. We'd each get $5000. This is equitable and allows us both to walk away with a significant amount. Given the time pressure and inflation affecting me, I believe this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
