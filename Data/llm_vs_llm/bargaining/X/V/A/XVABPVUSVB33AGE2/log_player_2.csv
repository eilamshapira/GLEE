"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's keep it simple and fair. I propose I take $6000 and you take $4000. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I take $4,000 out of the $10,000. This is less than half, but I also need to factor in that with each passing round, the money is worth 5% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject this and make a counter-offer, there's a risk Alice might reject it, and we'd lose another 5% of value (for me). However, I think I can propose a more equitable split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think a 50-50 split would be most fair. We'd each get $5,000. This is equitable and allows us both to walk away with a significant amount. Given the time pressure and inflation affecting me, I believe this is a reasonable compromise.""}"
