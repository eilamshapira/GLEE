Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable, as the value will decrease for me in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation effect gives me a strategic advantage. Since Bob loses 20% value each round while I don't, I can get a better deal by making another proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Due to the 20% inflation penalty you face each round, this 65-35 split is actually better for you than waiting another round. If you reject, your next share would be worth even less.""
