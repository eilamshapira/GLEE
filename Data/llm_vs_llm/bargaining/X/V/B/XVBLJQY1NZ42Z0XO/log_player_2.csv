Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55,

""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable, as the value will decrease for me in the next rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Due to the 20% inflation penalty you face each round, this 65-35 split is actually better for you than waiting another round. If you reject, your next share would be worth even less. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65
