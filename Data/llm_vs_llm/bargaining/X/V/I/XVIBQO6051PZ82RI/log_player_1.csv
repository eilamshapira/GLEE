"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an initial offer that takes into account the different inflation rates we're facing.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing I get $5,500 and you get $4,500. I'm offering you a substantial portion while acknowledging that if we go to further rounds, inflation will impact me more severely (10% vs your 5%), so I have more incentive to reach a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more accommodating offer considering the inflation pressures we're both facing.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of $5,000 each. This is fair and acknowledges that with each passing round, inflation erodes our potential gains - mine at 10% and yours at 5%. An even split now would benefit us both rather than continuing with more rounds of negotiation."
