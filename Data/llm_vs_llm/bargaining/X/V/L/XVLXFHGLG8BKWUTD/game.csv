6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you can still make a good amount. Let's avoid losing value to inflation by agreeing early.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I propose a 50-50 split. This way, we both get an equal amount and avoid potential inflation issues. Let's agree to this fair division.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6300.0,3700.0,"Bob, I need to account for the 5% inflation that affects my share. With my current offer, I'd actually receive about 6000 after inflation, similar to my first offer. This adjustment is necessary to make it fair, as inflation affects me but not you.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Hi Alice, I understand the importance of adjusting for inflation, but I still want to ensure a fair division. I propose that I take $5200 and you take $4800. This way, I can offer you a bit more while still receiving a decent amount.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6800.0,3200.0,"Bob, let me explain the math: With the current 14.26% inflation affecting my share, if I get $6800, I'll effectively receive about $5830 after inflation. You'll get your full $3200. This is actually quite fair considering the inflation impact. We should reach an agreement soon as inflation will only make future negotiations more difficult for me.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I acknowledge your concerns about inflation, and I want us to find a common ground. I propose we split the money as $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This allows us both to have a reasonable amount while still considering your situation.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
7200.0,2800.0,"Bob, the inflation is now at 22.62%, severely impacting my share. With this offer, I'll actually receive only about $5570 after inflation (7200 * 0.7738), while you get your full $2800. This is becoming more urgent as inflation increases with each round. Please understand that I need to ask for more nominal dollars to achieve a fair effective split. Let's agree now before inflation makes it even harder to reach a fair deal.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Hi Alice, I see how inflation is affecting our negotiation, and I want to be fair. I propose a split of $5800 for me and $4200 for you. This gives you a decent amount while still allowing me to secure a larger share. Let's finalize this before inflation takes more value away from us.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
7800.0,2200.0,"Bob, we're now at round 9 with 30.17% inflation on my share. Even with this $7800 offer, I'll only effectively receive $5447 (7800 * 0.6983), while you get your full $2200. We only have a few rounds left before we both get nothing. This split actually gives us both reasonable amounts when accounting for inflation. Please accept so we don't risk losing everything.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand the urgency and impact of inflation on our negotiation. I propose a split of $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This way, you still get a decent amount while I secure a larger part. I believe this is a fair compromise as we aim to reach an agreement.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
8000.0,2000.0,"Bob, this is our second-to-last chance before we both get nothing. With 36.98% inflation, my $8000 would actually be worth only $5041.60 (8000 * 0.6302), while you get your full $2000. This is our last real chance for a fair deal that accounts for inflation. If we don't agree now, we risk getting nothing in the final round. Please accept this offer - it's better for both of us than walking away empty-handed.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
3800.0,6200.0,"Hi Alice, I know this is our final chance to agree, and I want to make an offer that reflects both our needs. I propose a split of $6200 for me and $3800 for you. This way, you still receive a meaningful amount while I can secure a larger portion. Let's finalize this deal to avoid losing everything!",Bob,12,
