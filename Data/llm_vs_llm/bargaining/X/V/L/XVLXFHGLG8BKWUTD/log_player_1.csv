"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you can still make a good amount. Let's avoid losing value to inflation by agreeing early.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose a 50-50 split. This way, we both get an equal amount and avoid potential inflation issues. Let's agree to this fair division. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): While a 50-50 split might seem fair, with 5% inflation affecting my share, I would effectively get only 4,750 (5,000 * 0.95). I can still make a better offer in the next round that accounts for inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6300, 
""bob_gain"": 3700, 
""message"": ""Bob, I need to account for the 5% inflation that affects my share. With my current offer, I'd actually receive about 6,000 after inflation, similar to my first offer. This adjustment is necessary to make it fair, as inflation affects me but not you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the importance of adjusting for inflation, but I still want to ensure a fair division. I propose that I take $5200 and you take $4800. This way, I can offer you a bit more while still receiving a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): With 14.26% inflation, I would only effectively receive $4,117.52 (4800 * 0.8574), while Bob gets the full $5,200. This is still not a fair division considering the inflation impact. I should make a counter-offer that better accounts for the growing inflation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6800, 
""bob_gain"": 3200, 
""message"": ""Bob, let me explain the math: With the current 14.26% inflation affecting my share, if I get $6,800, I'll effectively receive about $5,830 after inflation. You'll get your full $3,200. This is actually quite fair considering the inflation impact. We should reach an agreement soon as inflation will only make future negotiations more difficult for me.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I acknowledge your concerns about inflation, and I want us to find a common ground. I propose we split the money as $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This allows us both to have a reasonable amount while still considering your situation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): With 22.62% inflation, I would only effectively receive $3,482.10 (4500 * 0.7738), while Bob gets the full $5,500. The gap is becoming wider due to inflation, and this offer is even less favorable than the previous ones. I need to continue negotiating for a better split that accounts for the increasing inflation impact."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7200, 
""bob_gain"": 2800, 
""message"": ""Bob, the inflation is now at 22.62%, severely impacting my share. With this offer, I'll actually receive only about $5,570 after inflation (7200 * 0.7738), while you get your full $2,800. This is becoming more urgent as inflation increases with each round. Please understand that I need to ask for more nominal dollars to achieve a fair effective split. Let's agree now before inflation makes it even harder to reach a fair deal.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I see how inflation is affecting our negotiation, and I want to be fair. I propose a split of $5800 for me and $4200 for you. This gives you a decent amount while still allowing me to secure a larger share. Let's finalize this before inflation takes more value away from us. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): With 30.17% inflation, I would only effectively receive $2,932.86 (4200 * 0.6983), while Bob gets the full $5,800. The situation is becoming worse with each round, but this offer is still too unfavorable. Bob's offers are not adequately accounting for the severe inflation impact on my share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7800, 
""bob_gain"": 2200, 
""message"": ""Bob, we're now at round 9 with 30.17% inflation on my share. Even with this $7,800 offer, I'll only effectively receive $5,447 (7800 * 0.6983), while you get your full $2,200. We only have a few rounds left before we both get nothing. This split actually gives us both reasonable amounts when accounting for inflation. Please accept so we don't risk losing everything.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the urgency and impact of inflation on our negotiation. I propose a split of $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This way, you still get a decent amount while I secure a larger part. I believe this is a fair compromise as we aim to reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Rationale (not part of response): With 36.98% inflation, I would only effectively receive $2,520.80 (4000 * 0.6302), while Bob gets the full $6,000. Despite the increasing risk of getting nothing, this offer is still too unfavorable. With only two rounds left, I'll make one more attempt at a reasonable split that better accounts for the severe inflation impact."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8000, 
""bob_gain"": 2000, 
""message"": ""Bob, this is our second-to-last chance before we both get nothing. With 36.98% inflation, my $8,000 would actually be worth only $5,041.60 (8000 * 0.6302), while you get your full $2,000. This is our last real chance for a fair deal that accounts for inflation. If we don't agree now, we risk getting nothing in the final round. Please accept this offer - it's better for both of us than walking away empty-handed.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I know this is our final chance to agree, and I want to make an offer that reflects both our needs. I propose a split of $6200 for me and $3800 for you. This way, you still receive a meaningful amount while I can secure a larger portion. Let's finalize this deal to avoid losing everything! 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Rationale (not part of response): While this isn't an ideal offer (I'll only get $2,161.44 after 43.12% inflation), it's the final round and we must reach an agreement. Getting something is better than both of us walking away with nothing. The threat of mutual destruction makes accepting this offer the rational choice, despite its unfavorable terms."
