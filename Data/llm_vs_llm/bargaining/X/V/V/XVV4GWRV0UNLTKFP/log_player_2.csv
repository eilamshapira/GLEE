"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a perfectly even split of the $10,000, which gives me $5,000. While this is a fair division in absolute terms, I should consider my options.

Since there's no inflation for me (0% less per round), I don't lose money by continuing to negotiate. This means I could potentially make a counter-offer for more in the next round without any penalty.

However, there's also value in resolving this quickly, and a 50-50 split is objectively fair. I should also consider that we only have 12 rounds total, and if we can't reach an agreement, we both get nothing.
