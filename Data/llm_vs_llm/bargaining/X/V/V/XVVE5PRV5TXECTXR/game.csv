550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since my money loses value faster (10% vs your 5%), I'm suggesting a slightly higher portion for me. If we delay, we both lose value, so it's in our mutual interest to agree now.",Alice,1,

475000.0,525000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand your point about the different inflation rates, but I believe my proposal of 525000 for me and 475000 for you is fair considering the rapid decrease in value for both of us. Let's settle this quickly to minimize our losses.",Bob,2,

530000.0,470000.0,"Bob, let's find a middle ground. Your offer gives you more than me despite my higher inflation rate. This is my final compromise - it acknowledges both our positions and the diminishing value we both face. With my 10% inflation vs your 5%, we should finalize now before we both lose more.",Alice,3,
