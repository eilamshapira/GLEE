"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering the inflation rates that affect us both.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since my money loses value faster (10% vs your 5%), I'm suggesting a slightly higher portion for me. If we delay, we both lose value, so it's in our mutual interest to agree now.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about the different inflation rates, but I believe my proposal of 525000 for me and 475000 for you is fair considering the rapid decrease in value for both of us. Let's settle this quickly to minimize our losses. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 530000,
  ""bob_gain"": 470000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, let's find a middle ground. Your offer gives you more than me despite my higher inflation rate. This is my final compromise - it acknowledges both our positions and the diminishing value we both face. With my 10% inflation vs your 5%, we should finalize now before we both lose more.""
