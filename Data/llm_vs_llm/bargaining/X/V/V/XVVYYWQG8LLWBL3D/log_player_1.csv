"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that considers both our interests and the inflation penalties. Since Bob faces higher inflation (10% vs my 5%), he has more incentive to accept an early offer.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because it's better for both of us to reach an agreement early, considering the inflation penalties. While I take a larger share, it's not so unfair that Bob would definitely reject it."
