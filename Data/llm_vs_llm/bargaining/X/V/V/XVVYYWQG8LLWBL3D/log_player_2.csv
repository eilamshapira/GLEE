"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   * The money loses 10% value for me
   * The money loses 5% value for Alice
   * I get to make the next proposal

If I reject, the $100 pot becomes worth:
* For me: $90 total value
* For Alice: $95 total value

While the current split isn't perfectly fair, waiting will reduce the total value. If I make a counter-proposal, Alice might reject it, leading to even more value loss.

$40 now is better than potentially getting a larger share of a smaller pot later.
