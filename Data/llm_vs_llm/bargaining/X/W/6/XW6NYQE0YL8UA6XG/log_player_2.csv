This offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor. It's best to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still not good for me considering the inflation. If I accept this offer, I'm essentially getting only approximately $12.8 (64% of $20) due to the two rounds of inflation. I'll try to push for a more equitable split in the next round."

I'm lowering my initial ask slightly, but still aiming for a larger share considering the inflation working against me. This offer gives me a decent chance of getting at least half the original value after inflation, and it might be tempting enough for Alice to accept."
