5000.0,5000.0,I suggest we split the money equally - it's the fairest solution for both of us.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I understand you want to split fairly, but I'm taking a bigger risk going into round 2. How about a 60/40 split?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Since the money is worth less for you each round, I suggest we finish this now. This split gives you $4500 which is worth $4275 to you - still a substantial amount. If we continue, inflation will reduce your value further. Let's conclude this reasonably.",Alice,3,
