"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to split fairly, but I'm taking a bigger risk going into round 2. How about a 60/40 split? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Bob's offered me $4000 vs my original $5000 proposal
2. For Bob, his $6000 is actually worth $5700 due to 5% inflation
3. He's right about taking a risk by rejecting, but I can still reject and make another offer
4. If I reject, the money will be worth even less for Bob in the next round
5. Bob showed some willingness to negotiate by explaining his reasoning

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since I can still propose a better split for myself in the next round, and Bob's inflation penalty gives me some leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Since the money is worth less for you each round, I suggest we finish this now. This split gives you $4500 which is worth $4275 to you - still a substantial amount. If we continue, inflation will reduce your value further. Let's conclude this reasonably.""
