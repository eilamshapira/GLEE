"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest we split the money equally - it's the fairest solution for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I understand you want to split fairly, but I'm taking a bigger risk going into round 2. How about a 60/40 split?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Since the money is worth less for you each round, I suggest we finish this now. This split gives you $4500 which is worth $4275 to you - still a substantial amount. If we continue, inflation will reduce your value further. Let's conclude this reasonably. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
