"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my initial offer to Bob, keeping in mind that delay costs me 20% per round while it doesn't affect Bob's value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while a 50/50 split sounds fair, time is money. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Let's settle this now and avoid further losses for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4800, 
""bob_gain"": 5200, 
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but we need to be more balanced. I'm offering you 52% ($5,200) which is more than fair given that I started with 50-50. The 20% inflation affects only me, so delaying further will force increasingly uneven splits that benefit neither of us strategically. Let's conclude this now.""}"
