"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. Let's work together efficiently since delays cost me more than they cost you. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, while a 50/50 split sounds fair, time is money. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Let's settle this now and avoid further losses for both of us.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but we need to be more balanced. I'm offering you 52% ($5200) which is more than fair given that I started with 50-50. The 20% inflation affects only me, so delaying further will force increasingly uneven splits that benefit neither of us strategically. Let's conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
