Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where you get a slightly bigger share. Let's agree on this and enjoy our gains!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the 10% inflation that affects your share each round, I believe this is actually a fair offer. Your $400000 now is worth more than a smaller amount in future rounds. If we keep negotiating, both our shares could decrease in value. Let's settle this now for our mutual benefit. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
