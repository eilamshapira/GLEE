"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's settle early and avoid unnecessary inflation losses. I propose we split $100 with $55 for me and $45 for you. This way we both secure a good portion before the value drops. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

At first glance, getting $45 isn't bad, but it's less than half. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be worth 10% less to me ($90 effective value). 

If I propose a 50-50 split next round, I could get $45 (same as current offer) even after the 10% inflation ($50 * 0.9 = $45). Any amount above $50 in my counter-offer would give me more than the current $45 offer.

However, Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more value loss. There's also uncertainty about how inflation affects Alice's decisions.

Given that the current offer is reasonable and ensures an immediate decent payoff without risk, I'll accept.
