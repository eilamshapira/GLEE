"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer.

Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, giving each of us $50. This is a fair and equal division of the money. 

If I reject this and we move to the next round, the total value will decrease by 5% (to $95 total), and while I could then propose a division that gives me more than $50, Alice might reject it, leading to further depreciation.

Given that this is a fair opening offer that avoids inflation losses, I'll accept it.
