"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $49 out of $100, while taking $51 for herself. It's slightly in her favor, but nearly equal.

If I reject, I can make my own offer next round, but I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty. After one round, the $100 would effectively be worth $95 to me. So if I reject now and try to get more than $49 in the next round, I'd need to secure at least $51.58 (= $49 รท 0.95) to come out ahead.

While I could try to negotiate for more, Alice's offer is quite fair and nearly even. The risk of further negotiation with the inflation penalty doesn't seem worth it for a potentially small gain.
