Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since we're already losing value, I propose $55 for me and $45 for you. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation. Let's settle this soon!

# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
