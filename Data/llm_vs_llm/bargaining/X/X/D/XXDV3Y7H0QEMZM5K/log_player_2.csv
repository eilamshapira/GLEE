"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's keep things efficient and fair. I'll take $60, and you'll have $40. It's a good starting point and saves us from losing value in future rounds! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, since we're already losing value, I propose $55 for me and $45 for you. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation. Let's settle this soon!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's try to find a middle ground with $52 for me and $48 for you. This gets us close to an even split and avoids more loss from inflation. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
