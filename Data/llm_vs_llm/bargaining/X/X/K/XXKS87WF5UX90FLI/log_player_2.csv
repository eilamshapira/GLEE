"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, fair for both 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even 50/50 split, which gives me $5,000. This seems fair on the surface, but I need to account for the inflation effect.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me. So if I were to get even the full $10,000 in the next round, it would only be worth $8,000 to me due to inflation.

Given that a bird in hand is worth two in the bush, and the even split is objectively fair, I'll accept this offer.
