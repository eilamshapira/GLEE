"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer provides me with only $1 out of the total $1,000,000, which is extremely unbalanced. Since rejecting this offer allows me to make my own proposal in the next round, I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced division.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I suggest we split the money equally, which would be fair to both of us. This way we both receive a significant amount, and neither of us has reason to feel unfairly treated."
