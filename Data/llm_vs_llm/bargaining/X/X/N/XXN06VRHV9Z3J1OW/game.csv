600000.0,400000.0,Let's split this fairly. I'm offering you $400000 to end this quickly and avoid further loss due to inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split would be more fair. Since inflation doesn't affect me (0%), I'm comfortable continuing negotiation, but I'd prefer we reach an equitable agreement quickly. A half-million each seems fair to both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
560000.0,440000.0,"Okay, Bob, I see your point about fairness. Considering the ongoing inflation for me, I can offer you $440000. It's still a good deal for you compared to what you'd get if we continued.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand inflation is affecting your position more than mine. Given this asymmetry, I'm proposing I get $550000 and you get $450000. This accounts for the inflation factor while still giving you a substantial portion. If we continue for more rounds, inflation will reduce your share's value even further, so this is a reasonable compromise that benefits us both now.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alright Bob, let's split it evenly. I'll concede to a 50/50 split to end the negotiation here. It's still better than risking more rounds and further loss for me due to inflation.",Alice,5,
