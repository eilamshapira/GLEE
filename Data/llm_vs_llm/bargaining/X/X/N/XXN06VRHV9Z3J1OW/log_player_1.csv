Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split would be more fair. Since inflation doesn't affect me (0%), I'm comfortable continuing negotiation, but I'd prefer we reach an equitable agreement quickly. A half-million each seems fair to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand inflation is affecting your position more than mine. Given this asymmetry, I'm proposing I get $550000 and you get $450000. This accounts for the inflation factor while still giving you a substantial portion. If we continue for more rounds, inflation will reduce your share's value even further, so this is a reasonable compromise that benefits us both now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
