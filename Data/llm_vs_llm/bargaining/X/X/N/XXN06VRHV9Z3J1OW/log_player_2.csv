"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly. I'm offering you $400000 to end this quickly and avoid further loss due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which means she would get $600,000. While this isn't an even split, it's a substantial amount.

Since inflation doesn't affect me (0% inflation per round for me), I don't lose value by continuing to negotiate. This gives me an advantage, as I can potentially make a counter-offer in the next round without any penalty.

Given that we have 12 rounds total and this is only round 1, I think I can try for a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while explaining my reasoning.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a 50-50 split would be more fair. Since inflation doesn't affect me (0%), I'm comfortable continuing negotiation, but I'd prefer we reach an equitable agreement quickly. A half-million each seems fair to both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I see your point about fairness. Considering the ongoing inflation for me, I can offer you $440000. It's still a good deal for you compared to what you'd get if we continued. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer and what it reveals. Alice has mentioned that inflation affects her, and the system has confirmed that the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. This suggests that inflation affects Alice significantly per round, while it doesn't affect me at all.

Alice is now offering me $440,000, which is an improvement from her first offer of $400,000. However, given the significant inflation penalty she faces and the fact that I face no inflation penalty, I have a strategic advantage in continuing negotiations.

Since we still have 9 more potential rounds, and Alice's position weakens with each round due to inflation, I believe I can get a better offer by continuing.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the inflation affects Alice significantly but doesn't affect me, I'll adjust my offer to acknowledge this dynamic while still pushing for an advantage.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I understand inflation is affecting your position more than mine. Given this asymmetry, I'm proposing I get $550,000 and you get $450,000. This accounts for the inflation factor while still giving you a substantial portion. If we continue for more rounds, inflation will reduce your share's value even further, so this is a reasonable compromise that benefits us both now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, let's split it evenly. I'll concede to a 50/50 split to end the negotiation here. It's still better than risking more rounds and further loss for me due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has now offered a 50/50 split, which is $500,000 for each of us. This is the same even split I proposed in round 2.

I need to consider a few factors:
1. Inflation doesn't affect me at all (0%)
2. Alice is facing significant inflation (now at 59.04% less value than round 1)
3. We still have 7 potential rounds remaining
4. Alice seems to be feeling the pressure from inflation

While a 50/50 split is equitable in principle, the game mechanics give me a strategic advantage. With each passing round, Alice's inflation penalty increases, weakening her position. If I reject this offer and we go further, I could potentially secure an even better deal in the next round.

However, there's also risk in pushing too hard. If we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing.

Given that we've reached a fair 50/50 split that I originally proposed, and considering the risk of pushing too far:
