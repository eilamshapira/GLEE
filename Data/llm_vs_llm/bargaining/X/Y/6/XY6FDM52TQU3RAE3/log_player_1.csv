"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1, keeping in mind the impact of potential inflation in future rounds:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

Rationale: I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a slight advantage. I hope Bob will accept to avoid potential losses from inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. In Round 1, $1 for me was worth $1. Now, $1 for me is worth $0.95. For Bob, $1 was worth $1, and now it's worth $0.90.

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split. Let's calculate the value:

*   **Alice's perspective:** 50 * 0.95 = $47.50 (equivalent to round 1 dollars)
*   **Bob's perspective:** 50 * 0.90 = $45.00 (equivalent to round 1 dollars)

My initial offer would have given me $60. Given the inflation and Bob's offer, I will reject this offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn to propose again. Inflation continues to erode the value of the money. For me, $1 is now worth 0.95 * 0.95 = $0.9025 (relative to round 1). For Bob, $1 is worth 0.90 * 0.90 = $0.81 (relative to round 1).

I'll make a more compelling offer to try and secure a deal this round.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 53,
  ""bob_gain"": 47
}
```

Rationale: This offer gives me slightly more than Bob's previous offer in round 2 (53 * .9025 = ~47.83 in round 1 dollars, compared to Bob's 50*.9 = 45). While I would prefer more, the risk of further inflation for both of us makes this a reasonable compromise to get the deal done."
