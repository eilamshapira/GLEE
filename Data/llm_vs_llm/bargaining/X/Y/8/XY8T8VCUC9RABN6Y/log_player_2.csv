"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

This is a fair 50-50 split, but I need to consider the inflation factor:
- If I reject and propose in the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me
- My $5000 in the next round would only be worth $4000 in today's value
- Alice's value doesn't decrease

While I might be able to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes waiting risky. A guaranteed $5000 now is better than potentially getting less value later.
