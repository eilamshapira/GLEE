"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose to split the money with 60% for me and 40% for you. This way, we both get a fair share, and you still get a substantial amount. Considering the inflation affecting you, it's better to accept a reasonable offer early on. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice offers me 4000$ (40%)
2. If I reject, we move to next round where:
   * I can make a counter-offer
   * But my money will be worth 20% less
   * 4000$ now > 5000$ next round (worth only 4000$ to me due to 20% inflation)

Given that:
- This is a decent first offer
- Inflation works against me
- There's risk in prolonging negotiations
- 4000$ is still a substantial amount
