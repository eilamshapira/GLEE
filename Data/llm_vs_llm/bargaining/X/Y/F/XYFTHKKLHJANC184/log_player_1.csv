"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives both parties a significant portion, but slightly favoring myself since I'm making the first move.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which gives me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. This is a fair offer that leaves Bob with a substantial sum while acknowledging my position as the first mover."
