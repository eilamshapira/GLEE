"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with an equal divide. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer is a 50-50 split, which is generally considered fair
2. If I reject, I get to make the next offer, but:
   - I don't know how inflation affects Alice
   - A 50-50 split is already quite reasonable
   - There's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable offer
3. Getting $500,000 immediately is a substantial amount
4. Since inflation doesn't affect me, there's no advantage in delaying

Given these factors, accepting a fair 50-50 split in the first round seems like the most rational choice.
