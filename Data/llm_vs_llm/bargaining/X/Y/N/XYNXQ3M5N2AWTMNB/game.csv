4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since you face 20% inflation per round and I don't, this is actually favorable to you compared to waiting another round. If we go to round 3, your share would be worth even less to you due to inflation. This offer gives you $4000 now, which is worth more than what you'd likely get after another round of negotiations with inflation.",Bob,2,
