"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to agree quickly due to the inflation affecting my gains.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since you face 20% inflation per round and I don't, this is actually favorable to you compared to waiting another round. If we go to round 3, your share would be worth even less to you due to inflation. This offer gives you $4000 now, which is worth more than what you'd likely get after another round of negotiations with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $4000 at 80% value = $3200 effective value
- If I reject and we go to round 3, any amount I get will be worth only 60% of its nominal value
- To beat the current offer's effective value ($3200) in round 3, I would need to get more than $5333 nominal value ($5333 * 60% = $3200)
- Given Bob's tough negotiating stance and the inflation pressure, securing such a high amount in round 3 seems unlikely
