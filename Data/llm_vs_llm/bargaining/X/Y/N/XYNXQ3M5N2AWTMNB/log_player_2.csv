"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to agree quickly due to the inflation affecting my gains. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider whether Alice's offer is fair given our different inflation effects.

In this game, my money doesn't lose value over rounds (0% inflation for me), while Alice faces 20% inflation per round. This means I have no pressure to accept quickly, while Alice should be motivated to reach an agreement soon.

If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice would face a 20% reduction in the value of whatever she receives. So her $6000 in the next round would effectively be worth only $4800 to her.

Given my stronger position, I believe I can get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation pressure Alice faces while using my advantageous position.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Since you face 20% inflation per round and I don't, this is actually favorable to you compared to waiting another round. If we go to round 3, your share would be worth even less to you due to inflation. This offer gives you $4000 now, which is worth more than what you'd likely get after another round of negotiations with inflation.""}"
