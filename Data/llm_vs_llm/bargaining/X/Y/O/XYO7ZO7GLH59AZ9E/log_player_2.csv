"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I reject, in the next round I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 10% less to me and 5% less to Alice.

$40 now is worth more than a potentially higher amount in the next round due to the higher inflation rate affecting me (10%).

If I reject, $100 will be worth $90 for me and $95 for Alice in the next round. Even if I propose a more favorable split then, the total value will be less.

The current offer gives me $40, which is a reasonable share. While not perfectly equal, it's good enough considering the inflation penalty for rejecting.
