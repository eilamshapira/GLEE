"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to propose a split of the $10,000, keeping in mind the decreasing value of the money with each round for both me and Bob. Since it's the first round, I'll start with a relatively fair offer, hoping to get Bob to accept quickly.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my offer and now has proposed a split where I get $4000 and he gets $6000.

Before I decide, I need to consider the inflation. For me, the money is worth 20% less than in round 1. So, $4000 now is worth $4000 * 0.8 = $3200 in round 1 dollars.

I need to weigh this against the potential for further inflation if I reject this offer. Let's see... if I reject, and I make a more generous offer next round, but Bob rejects it, then the money is worth even less to me.

Since Bob is taking the bigger share, I will reject.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. I need to be more strategic. I rejected Bob's offer of $4000/$6000. Remember, for me, the money is worth 20% less *again*, so now it's only 64% of its original value. For Bob, it's 19% less.

I will try to make an offer that is still advantageous to me, but enticing enough for Bob to accept, considering the value decay.

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}
