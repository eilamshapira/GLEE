"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a proposal to divide the $10,000 between Bob and me.

Since Bob faces a 20% reduction in value with each passing round, I should offer him a fair amount that incentivizes him to accept now rather than waiting.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even 50-50 split, where we each get $5,000. This is a fair division that respects both our interests."
