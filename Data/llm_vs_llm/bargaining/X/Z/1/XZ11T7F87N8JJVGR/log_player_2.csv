"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, inflation is costing us both 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in round 3 is the most logical choice given the circumstances:

* **Inflation:**  The longer the game goes, the less the money is worth. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable sum. 
* **Alice's Position:** Her offer is closer to even now, suggesting a willingness to compromise. Further rejection might make her less generous. 
* **Uncertainty:** We don't know how inflation affects Alice. If it's less severe for her, she might be content to wait for a larger share in later rounds."
