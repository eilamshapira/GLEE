"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I want to be fair, but I also want to account for the fact that I'm making the first offer. Here's my proposal:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm offering Alice $5500 and Bob $4500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob rejected my offer, and now he's proposing $4500 for me and $5500 for himself. Since the value of the money has decreased by 10%, $4500 now is worth less than $5000 was in the first round. Although I initially wanted $5500, I will accept, because if I decline we lose another 10%.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
