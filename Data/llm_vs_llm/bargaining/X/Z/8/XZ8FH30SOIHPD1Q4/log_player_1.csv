I propose that you get $999,999, and I get $1. This is a fair and equitable offer, and I believe it will lead to a quick and efficient resolution.  Let's end this game and start enjoying our winnings! ðŸ˜Š"

I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to be completely taken advantage of. This offer still gives you a significant portion of the money, but it's closer to a fairer split.  Let's make a deal!"

This is a surprising turn of events!  I'll gladly accept your offer.  Even though I'm getting the full amount, I'm surprised that you're willing to take nothing.  I hope you have a good reason, and I wish you well."
