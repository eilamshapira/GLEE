450000.0,550000.0,"Hi Alice, I understand the impact of inflation, but I think your initial offer was unfair. I'm willing to find a middle ground. Let's split the money in a way that we both benefit. My offer is $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can avoid further losses due to inflation.",Bob,2,
