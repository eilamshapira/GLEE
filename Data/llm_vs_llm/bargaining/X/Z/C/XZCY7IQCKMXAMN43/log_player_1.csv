Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's secure our gains now to avoid the 20% inflation impact in later rounds. I'm proposing $750,000 for me and $250,000 for you. Accepting this offer guarantees you $250,000 today, while waiting might cost us both. Let’s settle this quickly and fairly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the impact of inflation, but I think your initial offer was unfair. I'm willing to find a middle ground. Let's split the money in a way that we both benefit. My offer is $550000 for me and $450000 for you. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, your offer is appealing given the inflation risk I face. I’m willing to accept your proposal of $550,000 for you and $450,000 for me in this round. Let's settle now rather than risk further discounts later.""}"
