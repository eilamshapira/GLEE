"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's secure our gains now to avoid the 20% inflation impact in later rounds. I'm proposing $750000 for me and $250000 for you. Accepting this offer guarantees you $250000 today, while waiting might cost us both. Letâ€™s settle this quickly and fairly. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the impact of inflation, but I think your initial offer was unfair. I'm willing to find a middle ground. Let's split the money in a way that we both benefit. My offer is $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can avoid further losses due to inflation.""}"
