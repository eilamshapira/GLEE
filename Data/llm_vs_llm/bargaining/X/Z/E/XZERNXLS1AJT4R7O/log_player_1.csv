"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For Round 1, I'll make a reasonable first offer that acknowledges the time pressure I face due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This gives you a substantial portion while accounting for the fact that I lose 10% of the money's value each round, so I need to secure a deal sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For Round 3, I need to adjust my offer considering the inflation pressure I'm facing.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

I'm offering you a more favorable split than my first proposal. Given that I lose 20% value already due to inflation, I need to secure a deal soon, but I still need enough compensation to make this worthwhile for me."
