650000.0,350000.0,Let's start with a reasonable offer. This gives us both a good share.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering that if we delay further, your share will lose more value (from 100% to 80% of its nominal value this round versus 64% if you wait for the next round), I believe it's in our mutual best interest to settle now. Please accept this division: you receive $800000 and I receive $200000.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. I understand the time pressure, but your previous offer was far too skewed. This is my final offer.",Alice,3,
,,"Alice, your offer gives me an effective 202500 (250000 × 0.81), and given that I’ll be the proposer in the next round with a relatively more favorable discount (my money only loses 10% additional value next round compared to your loss of 20%), I believe I can secure a better deal by taking the floor. I must therefore reject your offer.",Bob,3,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Alice, I understand the pressure of these diminishing values. As we move into round 4, every delay further erodes our respective shares—my portion by 27.1% from the original value and yours by 48.8%. To avoid further losses, I propose a split where you receive $800000 and I receive $200000. With this offer, your share is worth approximately $409600 in today’s terms (800000 × 0.512), which I believe is competitive with what you could secure in the next round as proposer—while also sparing us both additional devaluation. I hope you see this as a fair and mutually beneficial agreement so we can conclude our negotiations promptly.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I'm dropping my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but this is as low as I'm willing to go. Let's end this here.",Alice,5,
,,"Alice, under your offer I’d effectively receive about $196830 (300000 × 0.6561) compared to your $286720 after discount. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I believe that as the next proposer I can structure an agreement that will yield a better outcome for both of us when we consider the ongoing devaluation. I therefore must reject your offer and await the opportunity to propose a more balanced and mutually beneficial division in the next round.",Bob,5,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Alice, to avoid further losses from depreciation, I’m proposing we settle now. Under this offer, I receive $350000 and you receive $650000. With the round 6 discount, that amounts to an effective value of about $206671 for me (350000 × 0.59049) and roughly $212992 for you (650000 × 0.32768). Given that in the next round the depreciation will only worsen your position—with your money worth only about 0.8^5 (≈0.32768) of its nominal value—this deal provides you a better outcome than waiting for further negotiations. I believe this is a fair compromise that protects both our interests from the rapid erosion of value. I look forward to your acceptance.",Bob,6,
