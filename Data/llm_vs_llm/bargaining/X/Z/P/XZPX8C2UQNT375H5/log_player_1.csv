Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering that if we delay further, your share will lose more value (from 100% to 80% of its nominal value this round versus 64% if you wait for the next round), I believe it's in our mutual best interest to settle now. Please accept this division: you receive $800000 and I receive $200000.

# Bob gain: 200000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the pressure of these diminishing values. As we move into round 4, every delay further erodes our respective shares—my portion by 27.1% from the original value and yours by 48.8%. To avoid further losses, I propose a split where you receive $800000 and I receive $200000. With this offer, your share is worth approximately $409600 in today’s terms (800000 × 0.512), which I believe is competitive with what you could secure in the next round as proposer—while also sparing us both additional devaluation. I hope you see this as a fair and mutually beneficial agreement so we can conclude our negotiations promptly.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, to avoid further losses from depreciation, I’m proposing we settle now. Under this offer, I receive $350000 and you receive $650000. With the round 6 discount, that amounts to an effective value of about $206671 for me (350000 × 0.59049) and roughly $212992 for you (650000 × 0.32768). Given that in the next round the depreciation will only worsen your position—with your money worth only about 0.8^5 (≈0.32768) of its nominal value—this deal provides you a better outcome than waiting for further negotiations. I believe this is a fair compromise that protects both our interests from the rapid erosion of value. I look forward to your acceptance. 
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but it's time to accept. Bob is clearly aiming for a slow win, and while this isn't the best deal, it's getting increasingly worse for me with each passing round. 

Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The inflation is hitting me much harder than Bob. Accepting 650,000 now might be better than hoping for a slightly better deal in later rounds where the value will be significantly eroded.
* **Bob's Stubbornness:** Bob seems unlikely to budge much from this offer. He's betting on me caving as the pressure from inflation mounts.

While I'm not thrilled, taking this offer cuts my losses and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing."
