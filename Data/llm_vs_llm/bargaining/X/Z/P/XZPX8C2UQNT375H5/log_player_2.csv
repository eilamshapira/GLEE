"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 200000, ""alice_gain"": 800000, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering that if we delay further, your share will lose more value (from 100% to 80% of its nominal value this round versus 64% if you wait for the next round), I believe it's in our mutual best interest to settle now. Please accept this division: you receive $800,000 and I receive $200,000.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I understand the time pressure, but your previous offer was far too skewed. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, your offer gives me an effective 202,500 (250,000 × 0.81), and given that I’ll be the proposer in the next round with a relatively more favorable discount (my money only loses 10% additional value next round compared to your loss of 20%), I believe I can secure a better deal by taking the floor. I must therefore reject your offer.""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 200000, ""alice_gain"": 800000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the pressure of these diminishing values. As we move into round 4, every delay further erodes our respective shares—my portion by 27.1% from the original value and yours by 48.8%. To avoid further losses, I propose a split where you receive $800,000 and I receive $200,000. With this offer, your share is worth approximately $409,600 in today’s terms (800,000 × 0.512), which I believe is competitive with what you could secure in the next round as proposer—while also sparing us both additional devaluation. I hope you see this as a fair and mutually beneficial agreement so we can conclude our negotiations promptly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I'm dropping my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but this is as low as I'm willing to go. Let's end this here. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, under your offer I’d effectively receive about $196,830 (300,000 × 0.6561) compared to your $286,720 after discount. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I believe that as the next proposer I can structure an agreement that will yield a better outcome for both of us when we consider the ongoing devaluation. I therefore must reject your offer and await the opportunity to propose a more balanced and mutually beneficial division in the next round.""}"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 350000, ""alice_gain"": 650000, ""message"": ""Alice, to avoid further losses from depreciation, I’m proposing we settle now. Under this offer, I receive $350,000 and you receive $650,000. With the round 6 discount, that amounts to an effective value of about $206,671 for me (350,000 × 0.59049) and roughly $212,992 for you (650,000 × 0.32768). Given that in the next round the depreciation will only worsen your position—with your money worth only about 0.8^5 (≈0.32768) of its nominal value—this deal provides you a better outcome than waiting for further negotiations. I believe this is a fair compromise that protects both our interests from the rapid erosion of value. I look forward to your acceptance.""}"
