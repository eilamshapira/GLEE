"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money with me getting $55 and you getting $45. This is fair considering inflation affects me by 5% each round, so if we delay, we both lose value. Let's make a deal now and both walk away happy! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is claiming that inflation affects her by 5% each round, while it affects me by 10% per round. If I reject, the value decreases for both of us, but more significantly for me.

Let me think through this: If I reject and propose in the next round, I'll be offering a split of the money that's worth 10% less to me. Alice might also be incentivized to reject my counter-offer due to her claimed lower inflation rate.

Given that we only have 12 rounds total and my value decreases faster, accepting $45 now might be better than risking further rounds of negotiation where my purchasing power continues to decline.
