"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Bob faces steeper inflation (20% vs 10% per round), I should make a reasonable first offer that he's likely to accept, as waiting will hurt him more than me. However, I can use this slight advantage to seek a bit more than 50-50.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a fair offer considering both our inflation rates, and it would be rational for Bob to accept rather than wait for the next round where the total value would be less for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $45, but it's worth 10% less, so effectively $40.5
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, we'll face further inflation
- Bob's $55 is worth 20% less to him, so effectively $44 for him

While this offer isn't ideal for me, waiting another round would mean even more value loss for both of us. The next round would reduce values by another 10% for me and 20% for Bob, making it harder to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
