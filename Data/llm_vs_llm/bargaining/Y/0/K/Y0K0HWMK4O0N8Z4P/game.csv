5500.0,4500.0,I propose we split the money with me getting 5500 and you getting 4500. This seems fair considering the inflation risk I face.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I know we both want to secure our value without risking further inflation losses. With each round, any uncertainty only hurts you more than me. I propose a division where I take $6000 and you get $4000—this way, you lock in your share now before any further devaluation. I hope you see the merit in settling immediately.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split it evenly, 5000 each. This way, we both get a fair share, and I minimize my losses due to inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, every passing round further erodes the value you receive, while my share remains unaffected. By accepting this offer now, you secure $3000 in real value rather than risking an even lower effective amount in future rounds. I believe this is a fair opportunity to mitigate your inflation risk, so I urge you to agree to the division.",Bob,4,

4500.0,5500.0,"Bob, I'm willing to take a slight hit to wrap this up. I'll take 4500, and you get 5500. This way, we both walk away with a reasonable share, considering the inflation I'm facing.",Alice,5,

1000.0,9000.0,"Alice, I understand you’d prefer a more balanced split, but every round you wait further diminishes the real value of your share. While you might hope to secure a better deal on your turn, the inflation penalty you face only gets worse, and I remain fully shielded from it. By accepting $1000 now, you lock in what may be your best realistic outcome—far better than risking an even steeper loss in value later. I urge you to consider this offer carefully and accept so we can both avoid further erosion.",Bob,6,
