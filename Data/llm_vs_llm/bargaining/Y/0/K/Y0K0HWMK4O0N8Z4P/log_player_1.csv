Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know we both want to secure our value without risking further inflation losses. With each round, any uncertainty only hurts you more than me. I propose a division where I take $6000 and you get $4000—this way, you lock in your share now before any further devaluation. I hope you see the merit in settling immediately. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every passing round further erodes the value you receive, while my share remains unaffected. By accepting this offer now, you secure $3000 in real value rather than risking an even lower effective amount in future rounds. I believe this is a fair opportunity to mitigate your inflation risk, so I urge you to agree to the division. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you’d prefer a more balanced split, but every round you wait further diminishes the real value of your share. While you might hope to secure a better deal on your turn, the inflation penalty you face only gets worse, and I remain fully shielded from it. By accepting $1000 now, you lock in what may be your best realistic outcome—far better than risking an even steeper loss in value later. I urge you to consider this offer carefully and accept so we can both avoid further erosion. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000
