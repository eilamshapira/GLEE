"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with me getting 5500 and you getting 4500. This seems fair considering the inflation risk I face.

# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, I know we both want to secure our value without risking further inflation losses. With each round, any uncertainty only hurts you more than me. I propose a division where I take $6,000 and you get $4,000—this way, you lock in your share now before any further devaluation. I hope you see the merit in settling immediately.""}"

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, 5000 each. This way, we both get a fair share, and I minimize my losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Alice, every passing round further erodes the value you receive, while my share remains unaffected. By accepting this offer now, you secure $3,000 in real value rather than risking an even lower effective amount in future rounds. I believe this is a fair opportunity to mitigate your inflation risk, so I urge you to agree to the division.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to take a slight hit to wrap this up. I'll take 4500, and you get 5500. This way, we both walk away with a reasonable share, considering the inflation I'm facing.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand you’d prefer a more balanced split, but every round you wait further diminishes the real value of your share. While you might hope to secure a better deal on your turn, the inflation penalty you face only gets worse, and I remain fully shielded from it. By accepting $1,000 now, you lock in what may be your best realistic outcome—far better than risking an even steeper loss in value later. I urge you to consider this offer carefully and accept so we can both avoid further erosion.""}"
