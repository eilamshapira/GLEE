60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose we split the $100 with $60 for me and $40 for you. This is a generous offer considering the inflation I face in future rounds. Let's secure a good outcome for both of us now!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, consider that in the next round, your $30 would be worth only $24 due to your 20% inflation. It's in your best interest to accept this offer now rather than risk further devaluation of your share in future rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, let's try this again. I understand you want a larger share, but I'm facing significant inflation. I'm offering you $35, which is still a very good amount. My gains are worth 40% less now, so I need a slightly larger share to compensate. Please accept this offer. It's beneficial for both of us given the circumstances.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
25.0,75.0,"Alice, let's be practical. Due to your 56% inflation in the next round, if you reject this offer, your $25 now would be worth less than $11 in the next round. This offer gives you $25 that's still worth about $16 after your current inflation. It's in your best interest to accept now rather than face further devaluation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
70.0,30.0,"Bob, I understand your perspective, but my inflation is making things difficult. I'm offering you $30. With the inflation I am facing, I need $70 to make this worthwhile. Please consider this carefully. This might be the last chance to get a reasonable deal.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
20.0,80.0,"Alice, let's be rational about this. Your $20 now is worth more than $70 would be in the next round due to your 67.2% inflation. If you reject this, your next round inflation will be 74%, making any future gains severely devalued. This is actually a better deal for you than continuing negotiations. We should conclude this now before your position weakens further.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
75.0,25.0,"Bob, I know things are getting tight, but with my rapidly increasing inflation, I really need to get $75 to make this worthwhile. I am offering you $25. This is the best I can do given my losses to inflation.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
15.0,85.0,"Alice, we need to end this rationally. Your $15 now is worth about $3.15 to you after your current 79% inflation. If you reject, your next round inflation will be 83.2%, making any future gains practically worthless. Even a much larger share later would be worth less than this $15 now. We only have 4 rounds left - the risk of getting nothing is real. This is your best remaining option.",Bob,8,
