Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider that in the next round, your $30 would be worth only $24 due to your 20% inflation. It's in your best interest to accept this offer now rather than risk further devaluation of your share in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical. Due to your 56% inflation in the next round, if you reject this offer, your $25 now would be worth less than $11 in the next round. This offer gives you $25 that's still worth about $16 after your current inflation. It's in your best interest to accept now rather than face further devaluation.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be rational about this. Your $20 now is worth more than $70 would be in the next round due to your 67.2% inflation. If you reject this, your next round inflation will be 74%, making any future gains severely devalued. This is actually a better deal for you than continuing negotiations. We should conclude this now before your position weakens further. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to end this rationally. Your $15 now is worth about $3.15 to you after your current 79% inflation. If you reject, your next round inflation will be 83.2%, making any future gains practically worthless. Even a much larger share later would be worth less than this $15 now. We only have 4 rounds left - the risk of getting nothing is real. This is your best remaining option.
