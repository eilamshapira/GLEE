"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose we split the $100 with $60 for me and $40 for you. This is a generous offer considering the inflation I face in future rounds. Let's secure a good outcome for both of us now! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice faces 20% inflation per round, while I face no inflation
2. If Alice gets $60 now, that's her best case
3. If I reject, I can propose next round, and her money will be worth 20% less
4. By rejecting, I could potentially get a better deal in the next round when I make the offer

Given these factors, I should reject this offer. I can propose a more favorable split in the next round, and Alice will be more likely to accept due to the inflation pressure she faces.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer considering Alice's 20% inflation penalty:

{""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Alice, consider that in the next round, your $30 would be worth only $24 due to your 20% inflation. It's in your best interest to accept this offer now rather than risk further devaluation of your share in future rounds.""}

This offer is justified because:
1. Alice faces significant inflation pressure (20% per round)
2. If she rejects, her next round's money will be worth less
3. It's still early in the game, but the inflation threat makes this a reasonable offer
4. The message emphasizes the economic logic to encourage acceptance"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's try this again. I understand you want a larger share, but I'm facing significant inflation. I'm offering you $35, which is still a very good amount. My gains are worth 40% less now, so I need a slightly larger share to compensate. Please accept this offer. It's beneficial for both of us given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me less ($35) than her first offer ($40)
2. Due to her 36% inflation, her $65 is actually worth only $41.6 to her
3. If I reject, in the next round:
   - Her inflation will increase to 56%
   - I can make another offer
   - She'll be under more pressure to accept
4. We still have 9 rounds left
5. Alice's deteriorating position suggests I can get a better deal by waiting

Given these factors, I should reject this offer. The declining value of money for Alice gives me stronger negotiating power in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 75,
""alice_gain"": 25,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. Due to your 56% inflation in the next round, if you reject this offer, your $25 now would be worth less than $11 in the next round. This offer gives you $25 that's still worth about $16 after your current inflation. It's in your best interest to accept now rather than face further devaluation.""}

This offer is strategic because:
1. Alice now faces 56% inflation
2. The $25 I'm offering is actually more valuable to her now than a larger amount would be in future rounds
3. She's already seen I'm willing to reject lower offers
4. Time pressure is building (8 rounds left)
5. Her position weakens significantly with each round due to inflation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but my inflation is making things difficult. I'm offering you $30. With the inflation I am facing, I need $70 to make this worthwhile. Please consider this carefully. This might be the last chance to get a reasonable deal. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is now offering me even less ($30) than before ($35)
2. Her $70 is actually worth only about $28.67 to her (due to 59.04% inflation)
3. If I reject:
   - Her inflation will increase to 67.2%
   - I can make another offer
   - She'll be under even more pressure
4. We still have 7 rounds left
5. Her threat about ""last chance"" isn't credible because her position gets worse each round
6. She's actually demonstrating desperation by offering me less while taking more

The declining offers and increasing inflation make it clear I should reject and continue pressing my advantage.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 80,
""alice_gain"": 20,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be rational about this. Your $20 now is worth more than $70 would be in the next round due to your 67.2% inflation. If you reject this, your next round inflation will be 74%, making any future gains severely devalued. This is actually a better deal for you than continuing negotiations. We should conclude this now before your position weakens further.""}

This offer is strategic because:
1. Alice's inflation is now at a severe 67.2%
2. Her $20 now is worth about $6.56 to her
3. But if she rejects, her next round inflation will be even worse at 74%
4. We're halfway through the rounds (6 of 12)
5. The risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within the remaining rounds is becoming real
6. Alice's previous declining offers show she's running out of negotiating power"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I know things are getting tight, but with my rapidly increasing inflation, I really need to get $75 to make this worthwhile. I am offering you $25. This is the best I can do given my losses to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze:

1. Alice is offering me even less ($25) while asking for more ($75)
2. Her $75 is only worth about $19.65 to her (due to 73.79% inflation)
3. If I reject:
   - Her inflation will increase to 79%
   - I can make another offer
   - Her position becomes even more desperate
4. We have 5 rounds left
5. She's actually making worse offers despite her deteriorating position
6. Her $75 request shows she's not being realistic about her negotiating position

The fact that she's making increasingly worse offers while her position deteriorates suggests she's not negotiating rationally. I should reject and make a more aggressive offer next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 85,
""alice_gain"": 15,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to end this rationally. Your $15 now is worth about $3.15 to you after your current 79% inflation. If you reject, your next round inflation will be 83.2%, making any future gains practically worthless. Even a much larger share later would be worth less than this $15 now. We only have 4 rounds left - the risk of getting nothing is real. This is your best remaining option.""}

This offer is strategic because:
1. Alice's inflation is now at a crushing 79%
2. We're entering the final third of negotiations (4 rounds left)
3. The threat of getting nothing if we don't agree becomes very real
4. Her previous offer showed she's not recognizing her weakening position
5. The $15 now is actually worth more to her than larger amounts in future rounds
6. The time pressure and inflation make this a compelling offer to accept"
