"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual amount I'm dividing is $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000. For Alice, it's $1,000,000 * 0.95 = $950,000. However, the game rules imply that we're still negotiating over the original $1,000,000, with the value reduction affecting our perception of its worth.

Given this, I'll make an offer that splits the original amount in a way that seems reasonable, considering the value reduction.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meeting you halfway. Let's close this! 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the value reduction, for me, the $1,000,000 is now worth $1,000,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $640,000 due to two rounds of 20% reduction. For Alice, it's $1,000,000 * 0.95 * 0.95 = $902,500 due to two rounds of 5% reduction.

Given Alice's offer, I would gain $430,000, which is worth 67.19% of the reduced $640,000 (since $430,000 / $640,000 = 0.6719). This seems like a reasonable offer, considering the decreasing value of the money.
