"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the 20% loss Bob faces each round. Since I know he's under time pressure, I'll offer a reasonable split that should be attractive to him now.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. This is a fair offer considering Bob loses 20% of the value each round if he declines. If he waits just one round, his maximum potential gain would already be worth less to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Bob is offering me $400,000, which is worth full value to me
2. Bob wants $600,000, but it's already worth 20% less to him (effectively worth $480,000 to him)
3. If I reject, we go to round 3 where I can make another offer, but Bob's value will decrease by another 20%
4. I still have many rounds to negotiate, and Bob's position will continue to weaken

Given these factors, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer. The decreasing value to Bob will make him more likely to accept a better offer for me in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob has already rejected my first offer of 600k/400k, and I rejected his counter of 400k/600k, I'll adjust my offer considering that the money is now worth 40% less to him. I should propose a split that's more attractive to me while still being reasonable for Bob given his declining value.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

This offer gives Bob $300,000, which considering the 40% reduction in value for him, is still worth $180,000 in his perspective. If he rejects this and we continue to the next round, his value will decrease further. This makes the current offer more attractive than waiting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Bob is offering me $500,000, which is worth full value to me
2. Bob wants $500,000, but it's worth 48.8% less to him (effectively worth $256,000 to him)
3. If I reject, we go to round 5 where I can make another offer, and Bob's value will decrease further
4. The fact that Bob has increased his offer to me from $400,000 to $500,000 shows he's feeling the pressure of the declining value

Given that Bob's negotiating position is weakening (his money is worth less than half of the original value now) and we still have 8 rounds left, I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Bob's money is now worth 59% less to him (after another 20% drop from the previous round), and he's shown willingness to move to a 50/50 split in his last offer, I'll push for a more favorable split for me while still leaving him enough incentive to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

This offer gives Bob $200,000, which at 59% less value for him is worth about $82,000 in his perspective. While this might seem low, he needs to consider that if he rejects, his value will continue to decrease by 20% each round. The fact that he offered a 50/50 split last round shows he's feeling the pressure of the declining value, so this offer gives him a clear incentive to accept rather than risk further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Bob is offering me $600,000, which is worth full value to me
2. Bob wants $400,000, but it's worth 67.23% less to him (effectively worth about $131,000 to him)
3. Bob has increased his offer to me again (from $500,000 to $600,000), showing he's increasingly desperate
4. We still have 6 rounds left, and his value will continue to decrease significantly

The fact that Bob keeps increasing his offers to me (from 400k to 500k to now 600k) shows the time pressure is working. With 6 rounds still remaining and his value continuing to plummet, I believe I can still achieve a better outcome by rejecting this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Bob has shown increasing willingness to offer me more (now up to $600,000), and his money is now worth about 73.8% less to him (after another 20% drop from the previous round), I'll push for an even more favorable split.

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This offer gives Bob $100,000, which at 73.8% less value for him is worth about $26,200 in his perspective. While this is a very aggressive offer, Bob needs to consider:
1. He's already shown willingness to accept only $400,000 when it was worth even less to him
2. If he rejects, his value will continue to decrease by 20% each round
3. We're more than halfway through the rounds, increasing the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach agreement
4. His steadily increasing offers to me suggest he understands his weakening position

This offer gives him a clear choice between getting something of value now versus risking even further devaluation or potentially nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Bob is offering me $700,000, which is worth full value to me
2. Bob wants $300,000, but it's worth 79.03% less to him (effectively only worth about $63,000 to him)
3. Bob has increased his offer yet again (from 600k to 700k), showing he's very concerned about the time pressure
4. We still have 4 rounds left, and his value will continue to decrease significantly
5. His offers have steadily improved: 400k → 500k → 600k → 700k

While this is a tempting offer, the consistent pattern of Bob increasing his offers by 100k each time, combined with the severe devaluation he's facing and 4 rounds still remaining, suggests I can still achieve a better outcome by rejecting this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Bob's money is now worth about 83.2% less to him (after another 20% drop from the previous round), and he's shown a clear pattern of increasing his offers to me, I'll maintain strong pressure while ensuring the offer isn't so low that he'd prefer to risk everything.

{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}

This offer gives Bob $50,000, which at 83.2% less value for him is worth about $8,400 in his perspective. While this is a very aggressive offer, Bob should consider:
1. He's already shown willingness to accept significantly devalued amounts
2. His pattern of steadily increasing offers (400k → 500k → 600k → 700k) shows he understands his rapidly weakening position
3. Only 3 rounds remain after this, increasing the risk of both of us getting nothing
4. If he rejects, his next counter-offer would need to be around 800k for me to even consider it, leaving him with even less value

This offer gives him a chance to secure some value rather than risk getting nothing as we approach the final rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this critically:
1. Bob is offering me $800,000, which is worth full value to me
2. Bob wants $200,000, but it's worth 86.58% less to him (effectively only worth about $26,840 to him)
3. Bob has again increased his offer (from 700k to 800k), following his pattern
4. Only 2 rounds remain after this
5. The risk of getting nothing is becoming very real

While my strategy of pushing for more has worked well so far (as evidenced by Bob's steadily improving offers), we're now in a very risky position with only 2 rounds remaining. If I reject this, there's a significant chance we might not reach an agreement in time, resulting in both of us getting nothing. Given the high offer to me ($800,000) and the very real risk of total failure, I should accept this offer.
