55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob! I propose a slightly higher share for me because I face 5% inflation each round. If we delay, we both lose value. This is a fair split considering my declining purchasing power in later rounds.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"I rejected your offer because I think we should split it more evenly. Considering my 20% inflation, I'm taking a bigger risk by delaying. Let's be fair and split it 60-40 in my favor this time.",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, I appreciate your counterproposal. I now understand you face 20% inflation per round, which is significant. Let's meet exactly in the middle with a 50-50 split. This is completely fair given that we both face inflation - yours higher but mine compounding over time too. This balanced split respects both our positions and lets us both walk away with substantial value.",Alice,3,
