"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a fair division while acknowledging the inflation factor.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I propose a slightly higher share for me because I face 5% inflation each round. If we delay, we both lose value. This is a fair split considering my declining purchasing power in later rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I rejected your offer because I think we should split it more evenly. Considering my 20% inflation, I'm taking a bigger risk by delaying. Let's be fair and split it 60-40 in my favor this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counterproposal. I now understand you face 20% inflation per round, which is significant. Let's meet exactly in the middle with a 50-50 split. This is completely fair given that we both face inflation - yours higher but mine compounding over time too. This balanced split respects both our positions and lets us both walk away with substantial value.""}"
