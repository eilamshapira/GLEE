"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I propose a slightly higher share for me because I face 5% inflation each round. If we delay, we both lose value. This is a fair split considering my declining purchasing power in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""I rejected your offer because I think we should split it more evenly. Considering my 20% inflation, I'm taking a bigger risk by delaying. Let's be fair and split it 60-40 in my favor this time.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counterproposal. I now understand you face 20% inflation per round, which is significant. Let's meet exactly in the middle with a 50-50 split. This is completely fair given that we both face inflation - yours higher but mine compounding over time too. This balanced split respects both our positions and lets us both walk away with substantial value. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
