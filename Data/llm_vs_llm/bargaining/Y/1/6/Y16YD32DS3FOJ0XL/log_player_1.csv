"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation and my potential gains.

*   **My gain (before inflation):** 45
*   **Inflation adjustment:** My money is worth 5% less.
*   **Effective gain:** 45 * (1 - 0.05) = 45 * 0.95 = 42.75

Considering the time limit and the fact that my money is worth less with each passing round, I'll evaluate the offer. Since I don't know how inflation effects Bob, I will calculate the value of offer for me.
