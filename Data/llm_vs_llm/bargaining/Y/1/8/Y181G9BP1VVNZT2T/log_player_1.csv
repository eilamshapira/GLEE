"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share to start, but we can still avoid significant losses from inflation if we agree now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll calculate the actual value I'd get:

My gain: 40 * 0.95 = 38 (due to 5% inflation)

Since Bob's offer gives me a significant amount, and I don't want to risk further inflation losses, I'll accept this offer.
