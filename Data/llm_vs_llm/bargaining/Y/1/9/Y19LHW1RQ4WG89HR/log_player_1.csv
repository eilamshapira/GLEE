"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was far too unbalanced. I'm proposing a fair split that gives you a slight advantage. This is reasonable for both of us, and remember - if you reject, I'll lose 5% more value next round, but you won't. Let's be practical and close this now. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
