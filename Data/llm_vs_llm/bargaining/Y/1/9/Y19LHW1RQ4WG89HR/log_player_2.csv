"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be realistic, Bob. I'm taking the lion's share, but I'm leaving you a nice little piece. Accept this and we'll both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me only 1% ($10,000) of the total amount
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less to me next round
3. But I can make a counter-offer that could be much better
4. Even with the 5% penalty, I could propose a much more favorable split next round
5. $10,000 is too small a portion when dealing with $1M

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer, acknowledging the time pressure I'm under due to inflation:

{""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was far too unbalanced. I'm proposing a fair split that gives you a slight advantage. This is reasonable for both of us, and remember - if you reject, I'll lose 5% more value next round, but you won't. Let's be practical and close this now.""}"
