4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, I'm proposing $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This reflects our different inflation rates - your money loses value at 20% per round while mine only at 5%. If we continue negotiating, you'll lose more value than I will. This is a fair adjustment that recognizes our different situations, and we can both walk away with substantial value now rather than risk further devaluation.",Bob,2,

4800.0,5200.0,"Bob, since you rejected an even split and proposed a larger share for yourself, I'm adjusting my offer to $4800 for me and $5200 for you. This is still close to an even split but acknowledges your lower inflation rate. Let's settle this now before our shares lose more value.",Alice,3,
