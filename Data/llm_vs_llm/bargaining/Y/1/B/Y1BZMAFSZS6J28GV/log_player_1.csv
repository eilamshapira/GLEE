"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,

  ""message"": ""Hey Bob, let's split it evenly at $5,000 each. It's fair and we both win without further complications from inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm proposing $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This reflects our different inflation rates - your money loses value at 20% per round while mine only at 5%. If we continue negotiating, you'll lose more value than I will. This is a fair adjustment that recognizes our different situations, and we can both walk away with substantial value now rather than risk further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""Bob, since you rejected an even split and proposed a larger share for yourself, I'm adjusting my offer to $4,800 for me and $5,200 for you. This is still close to an even split but acknowledges your lower inflation rate. Let's settle this now before our shares lose more value.""
