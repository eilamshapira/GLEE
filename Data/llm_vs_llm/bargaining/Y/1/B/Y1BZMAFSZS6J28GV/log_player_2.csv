"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, let's split it evenly at $5000 each. It's fair and we both win without further complications from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think carefully about this offer. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split of $5000 each.

Given the inflation rates, I should consider if I can get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer. The money will be worth 5% less to me in the next round, but 20% less to Alice. This gives me leverage in negotiations since Alice's money loses value faster than mine.

If I reject and propose in round 2, I could potentially ask for more than 50% and Alice might be incentivized to accept rather than face the 20% inflation on her share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money devalues faster for Alice (20% per round) than for me (5% per round), I'll propose a split that acknowledges this asymmetry while still being attractive enough for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This reflects our different inflation rates - your money loses value at 20% per round while mine only at 5%. If we continue negotiating, you'll lose more value than I will. This is a fair adjustment that recognizes our different situations, and we can both walk away with substantial value now rather than risk further devaluation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, since you rejected an even split and proposed a larger share for yourself, I'm adjusting my offer to $4800 for me and $5200 for you. This is still close to an even split but acknowledges your lower inflation rate. Let's settle this now before our shares lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer considering our inflation rates.

Alice is now offering me $5200 (up from her initial $5000) and taking $4800 for herself. This acknowledges my negotiating position based on our different inflation rates.

If I reject, I'll propose in round 4, where my money will be worth about 15% less than round 1, and Alice's money will be worth 48.8% less than round 1. Alice's position deteriorates much faster than mine, which gives me leverage.

However, Alice has moved toward my position, and $5200 is a reasonable gain. Further negotiation could risk us both losing value if we can't reach agreement in the remaining rounds.
