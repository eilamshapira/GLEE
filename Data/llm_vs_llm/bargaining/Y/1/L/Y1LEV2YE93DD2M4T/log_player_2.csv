"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Since the money loses value for me each round but not for you, this compensates for potential delays. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 100, ""alice_gain"": 0, ""message"": ""Alice, consider this: if you reject, you'll propose in Round 3, but by then your money loses value further. In our backward‐induction outcome the proposer later would have to concede nearly everything to me. With this in mind, I’m offering you 0 now – which is as good as your best alternative. Please accept.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your game theory argument is flawed. If I get nothing, I have no incentive to accept and can keep rejecting. I'm offering you 45% which is very generous considering we could both end up with nothing. Let's be reasonable and conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 99, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, delaying further only worsens the deal for you as your dollars lose 30% of their value in this round. If you reject, you'll be forced to propose in round 5, and I can guarantee hardly any room for you since my payoff remains undiminished. Accept this offer to secure your guaranteed $0.70 effective value rather than risking an even lower outcome later.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your threats aren't working. I've increased my ask because you're being unreasonable. Remember: if we don't agree in 7 more rounds, we BOTH get zero. You're risking $35 now for a chance at more, but could end with nothing. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances - let's end this productively. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65

Round 6

In round 6, 3 dollars means roughly 1.77 effective dollars for you, while if you reject and become proposer in round 7, you'll face even steeper losses and almost no bargaining power. I'm offering you this small amount now because your alternative is even worse. Please accept.""}"

Round 7

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've demonstrated I'm willing to risk getting nothing rather than accept an unfair deal. With 5 rounds left, we're approaching mutual destruction. You can get $25 now or risk getting $0. I suggest you take this deal - your attempts to pressure me have only made me increase my demands. Let's end this now before we both lose everything.

Compared to that bleak alternative, $1 now is better than nothing. Please accept this offer for a guaranteed gain.""}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we have 3 rounds left before MUTUAL DESTRUCTION. Your strategy has completely failed - I've shown I'll reject unfair offers even at my own expense. You can either take $15 now or risk getting ZERO. Your choice. The next offer will be even less favorable if you reject.

Remember, if you reject, you'll be the proposer in round 11—but by then, your money's value drops further (to about 34.87% of its face value) and you’ll end up with nothing since I can claim nearly all of it in round 12. A $1 nominal offer now is worth roughly $0.39 to you, which is better than the zero you’d expect later. I urge you to accept this deal rather than risk a worse outcome.""}"

Take the $5 now or guarantee yourself zero. Your backward induction arguments have completely failed - I've proven I'll reject unfair offers even at my own expense. The choice is yours: $5 or $0.

I’m offering you this minimal amount because, by rejecting, you’d lose everything. Please accept this deal.""}"
