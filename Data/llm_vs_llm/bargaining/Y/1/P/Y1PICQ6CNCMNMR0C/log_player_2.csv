"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. 

Alice is offering me $400,000 which is 40% of the total amount. While this isn't an even split, it's still a substantial sum of money. However, by rejecting, I could counter with a more favorable proposal in the next round.

That said, there's risk in rejecting - Alice could respond with an even less favorable offer. And $400,000 is objectively a lot of money.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a more equitable split in my counter-proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still giving Alice a slight advantage to increase the chances of acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000}

I'm offering Alice $520,000 (52%) while keeping $480,000 (48%) for myself. This is much closer to a fair 50-50 split while still giving Alice a bit more, which might make her more likely to accept. It's also a significant improvement over the previous offer where I would have only received $400,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is an improved offer from Alice compared to her first proposal. She's now offering me $450,000 (45%) instead of the initial $400,000 (40%). While it's still not completely even, it's a reasonable compromise and better than her first offer.

Given that:
1. The offer has improved significantly
2. There's no guarantee that future rounds will yield better results
3. We might risk getting worse offers if the negotiation continues
4. $450,000 is still a substantial amount of money

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. It's a reasonable compromise and represents a successful negotiation where both parties moved toward a more equitable solution."
