"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the rules. I'm playing as Bob.

Let's analyze the situation.

*   **Alice's offer:** I get $400,000, and Alice gets $600,000.

*   **Inflation:** If I reject, the total money available in the next round will be worth only 80% of the current value.

Let's consider what happens if I reject and make a counter-offer next round. The total available next round will be $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000. Even if I demand a very high proportion like 70% for myself (which Alice is unlikely to accept) that would only be $560,000. Given the relative worth of the money due to inflation, $400,000 in this round is worth more than $560,000 in the next round.

Therefore, I should accept this offer.
