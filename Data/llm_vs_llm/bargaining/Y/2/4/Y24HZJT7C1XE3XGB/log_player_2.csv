"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I take $60 and you take $40. This seems fair to me as I am initiating the offer. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer or reject it and make a counter-offer.

Alice is proposing I get $40 and she gets $60.

If I reject, I'll get to make my own proposal in the next round. Since we're dividing $100, I could potentially propose a more favorable split for myself. However, Alice could then reject my offer, leading to another round.

Given that I'm currently being offered $40, which is less than half but still a substantial amount, I'll reject this offer to propose a more equitable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a fair 50-50 split, which is the most equitable division.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think an equal 50-50 split would be the fairest approach for both of us. This way we both benefit equally from the division.""}"
