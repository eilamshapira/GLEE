"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer that takes into account the asymmetric inflation rate.

Since Bob faces 20% inflation per round while I face 0%, I should offer him more to incentivize acceptance now rather than waiting.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if Bob rejects and we go to another round, his share would be worth 20% less to him. By accepting now, he gets full value of his portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 680000 
# Bob gain: 320000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
