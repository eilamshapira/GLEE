Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's go for an equal split this round, Alice. It's fair for both of us considering the inflation impact on my side. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation hitting me harder each round, I propose a 4800-5200 split. It's a bit more in your favor but still fair given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This offer is now more favorable than what I'm likely to get in future rounds, considering the inflation working against Bob. Accepting now guarantees a decent gain."
