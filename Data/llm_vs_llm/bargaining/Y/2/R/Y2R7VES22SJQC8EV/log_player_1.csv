"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider the actual value. 
The original amount I would get is 475000, but due to 5% inflation, its value is 475000 * 0.95 = 451250.

Considering this, I will make my decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. For me, it's 5% less each round, so it's 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of the original value. For Bob, it's 10% less each round, so it's 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.

I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less, I need to consider the actual value. 
The original amount I would get is 500000, but due to 14.26% inflation, its value is 500000 * (1 - 0.1426) = 500000 * 0.8574 = 428700.

Considering this, I will make my decision.
