Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer seems worse than Alice's first offer, it's important to remember the inflation. 

* **My perspective:** Accepting $450,000 now is worth less than accepting $400,000 in Round 1 due to the 19% inflation. 
* **Alice's perspective:** Her offer is only slightly less appealing to her now than her Round 1 offer due to the lower inflation rate she experiences.

I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a 50/50 split, which might seem overly generous at this point. However:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me.  Delaying further significantly hurts my potential gain. 
* **Fairness:**  While Alice has a slower inflation rate, a 50/50 split is demonstrably fair and might make her more likely to accept rather than risk further losses for both of us."
