600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, let's make this quick and fair. I propose we split the money with me receiving $600000 and you getting $400000. This way, you won't face a 20% loss in the next round. It's a win-win!",Alice,1,

520000.0,480000.0,"Alice, your initial offer was a bit too skewed in your favor.  Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a split that accounts for the devaluation: $480000 for me and $520000 for you.  This ensures a fairer outcome considering the decreasing value over time.",Bob,2,

570000.0,430000.0,"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective and want to find common ground. Considering the inflation impact, how about I take $570000 and you take $430000? This should be more favorable for both of us given the circumstances.",Alice,3,

540000.0,460000.0,"Alice, we need to reach a deal soon.  I'm proposing a final offer: $460000 for me and $540000 for you.  This is a compromise considering the time pressure and the fact that the money is losing value with every passing round.",Bob,4,
