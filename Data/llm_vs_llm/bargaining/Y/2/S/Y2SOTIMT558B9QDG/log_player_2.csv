Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's make this quick and fair. I propose we split the money with me receiving $600000 and you getting $400000. This way, you won't face a 20% loss in the next round. It's a win-win! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was a bit too skewed in your favor.  Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a split that accounts for the devaluation: $480,000 for me and $520,000 for you.  This ensures a fairer outcome considering the decreasing value over time.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your perspective and want to find common ground. Considering the inflation impact, how about I take $570000 and you take $430000? This should be more favorable for both of us given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
