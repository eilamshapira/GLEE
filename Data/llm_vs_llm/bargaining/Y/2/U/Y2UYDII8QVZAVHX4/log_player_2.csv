"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me 4000$ while taking 6000$ for herself
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation, any money I get next round will be worth 5% less to me
4. If I reject, my 4000$ would effectively become worth 3800$ next round

While the split isn't exactly 50/50, accepting now guarantees me 4000$. If I reject, I'd need to secure significantly more than 4210$ (to make up for the 5% inflation) to make it worthwhile, and Alice might not accept such a proposal.
