"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I want to start with a fair offer, considering the inflation aspect for me.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

My reasoning is: I propose to take a slightly larger share initially to account for the future inflation that will impact my potential gains if the negotiation drags on. I hope Bob finds this a reasonable starting point."
