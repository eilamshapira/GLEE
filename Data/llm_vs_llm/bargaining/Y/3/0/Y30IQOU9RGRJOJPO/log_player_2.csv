"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me a substantial amount ($4500), I should consider the impact of inflation. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in round 2, but the money will be worth 10% less to me. This means the full $10,000 would only be worth $9,000 to me in the next round.

If I accept now, I get $4,500 at full value. If I reject and try to get more next round, I would need to secure more than $5,000 (out of $9,000 effective value) to come out ahead.

Given the uncertainty about how inflation affects Alice and the risk of potentially getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds, I'll accept this reasonable first offer.
