"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. It's Round 1, and I'm Alice. I need to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept, considering his money devalues by 10% each round. I also need to consider that I lose nothing due to inflation. My goal is to get as much as possible while ensuring we don't reach the 12-round limit and lose everything.

Here's my proposal:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob $450,000. This gives me a slight advantage with $550,000. I believe this is a reasonable offer that Bob will accept because if he rejects and the game continues, the value of his potential gains in the next round decreases significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation. Bob has proposed an even split of $500,000 each. For me, that's still $500,000 of the original value. For Bob, this $500,000 is now worth 10% less than what I offered him in the previous round.

Given the circumstances, and to avoid further devaluation for Bob and the risk of reaching the 12-round limit, I will accept his offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
