600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 60/40. This is a fair offer considering the inflation penalty I face each round. If you decline, the total value decreases by 10% for me, making this the most efficient outcome for both of us.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, I propose we split the money equally. This way, both of us get a fair share. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm willing to take a equal share. It's a fair deal for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, thanks for your offer, but with the 10% inflation penalty I face each round, a 50-50 split isn't actually equal in real value. I'm proposing a 55-45 split to account for some of this disadvantage. This is more fair considering I've already lost 10% of my purchasing power, and will lose another 10% if you reject again. Let's conclude this now with a reasonable compromise.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I need to look out for my best interest as well. I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor this time. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I think this is a fair compromise given the circumstances.",Bob,4,

525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, I see we're getting closer to an agreement. Let's meet in the middle with a 52.5-47.5 split. At this point, I've already lost over 27% to inflation, and if we go another round, I'll lose even more. This offer is reasonable and allows us both to walk away with a substantial amount. Let's finalize this deal now so we both benefit.",Alice,5,
