"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make my offer for the first round:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 60/40. This is a fair offer considering the inflation penalty I face each round. If you decline, the total value decreases by 10% for me, making this the most efficient outcome for both of us.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose we split the money equally. This way, both of us get a fair share. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm willing to take a equal share. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but with the 10% inflation penalty I face each round, a 50-50 split isn't actually equal in real value. I'm proposing a 55-45 split to account for some of this disadvantage. This is more fair considering I've already lost 10% of my purchasing power, and will lose another 10% if you reject again. Let's conclude this now with a reasonable compromise.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I need to look out for my best interest as well. I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor this time. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I think this is a fair compromise given the circumstances.

# Bob gain: 550000

  ""bob_gain"": 475000,

At this point, I've already lost over 27% to inflation, and if we go another round, I'll lose even more. This offer is reasonable and allows us both to walk away with a substantial amount. Let's finalize this deal now so we both benefit.""
