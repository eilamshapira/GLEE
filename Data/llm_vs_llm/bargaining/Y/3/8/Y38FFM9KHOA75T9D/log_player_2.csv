"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 60/40. This is a fair offer considering the inflation penalty I face each round. If you decline, the total value decreases by 10% for me, making this the most efficient outcome for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I propose we split the money equally. This way, both of us get a fair share. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I'm willing to take a equal share. It's a fair deal for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer, but with the 10% inflation penalty I face each round, a 50-50 split isn't actually equal in real value. I'm proposing a 55-45 split to account for some of this disadvantage. This is more fair considering I've already lost 10% of my purchasing power, and will lose another 10% if you reject again. Let's conclude this now with a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I need to look out for my best interest as well. I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor this time. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I think this is a fair compromise given the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer to an agreement. Let's meet in the middle with a 52.5-47.5 split. At this point, I've already lost over 27% to inflation, and if we go another round, I'll lose even more. This offer is reasonable and allows us both to walk away with a substantial amount. Let's finalize this deal now so we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000
