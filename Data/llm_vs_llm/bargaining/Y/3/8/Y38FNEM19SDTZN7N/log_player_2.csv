Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle this time. We both lose money with each round, so a 50/50 split is the fairest option. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 19% less, a 50/50 split is actually more favorable to me than it seems.
