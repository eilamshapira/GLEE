Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's settle now to avoid any inflation losses. I propose I receive $5200 and you receive $4800. I believe this is a fair division that benefits both of us immediately.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the importance of addressing inflation, but I believe I deserve a bit more. How about I take $4000 and you take $6000? It's still fair and gives you a little extra. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
