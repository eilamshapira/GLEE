"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with me getting $600000 and you getting $400000. This seems like a fair starting point considering the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Current offer: $400,000 for me
2. If I reject, the next round will have 5% inflation
3. In the next round, the same amount would only be worth $380,000 to me
4. I would need to propose something significantly better to make up for the inflation loss
5. Alice is offering a 60-40 split, which isn't terrible given my inflation risk

While I could try to negotiate for a better deal, the inflation risk is significant. Even if I could get a 50-50 split in the next round, I would only get $475,000 in effective value (500,000 * 0.95). This is less than the current offer.
