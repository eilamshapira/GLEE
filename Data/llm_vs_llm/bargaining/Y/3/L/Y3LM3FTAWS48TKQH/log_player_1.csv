"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know the money is worth less to you each round, but I think 55-45 is a more reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
