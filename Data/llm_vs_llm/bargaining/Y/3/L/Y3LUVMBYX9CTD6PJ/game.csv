550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split. This is a fair compromise from both our previous positions, and it's better to reach an agreement now before inflation further reduces the value of my share.",Alice,3,

425000.0,575000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the impact of inflation on your share, I'm willing to make a slightly more generous offer than before. However, I still believe I should receive the larger portion, so I propose a 57.5-42.5 split.",Bob,4,

525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, I'm making a more moderate proposal of 52.5-47.5 split. With inflation already reducing my share by over 27%, this is actually quite favorable to you. We should reach an agreement soon to avoid further value loss on my end.",Alice,5,

400000.0,600000.0,"Hi Alice, given the significant impact of inflation on your share, I believe a 60-40 split is now a reasonable proposal. The longer we wait, the more your share will be devalued, so it's in your interest to accept this offer.",Bob,6,
