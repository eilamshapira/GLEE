"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable, considering we both want to reach an agreement quickly and avoid potential future losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 45-55 split isn't favorable enough considering I started with a more generous 60-40 offer. Even with 10% inflation affecting my share, I believe we can reach a better agreement. Let's continue negotiating."

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the impact of inflation on your share, I'm willing to make a slightly more generous offer than before. However, I still believe I should receive the larger portion, so I propose a 57.5-42.5 split. 
# Alice gain: 425000 
# Bob gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is still not favorable enough, especially since my share is already reduced by 27.1% due to inflation. Even though Bob is offering slightly more than last time, when accounting for inflation, I would effectively receive much less than what I originally proposed. Let's continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm making a more moderate proposal of 52.5-47.5 split. With inflation already reducing my share by over 27%, this is actually quite favorable to you. We should reach an agreement soon to avoid further value loss on my end.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, given the significant impact of inflation on your share, I believe a 60-40 split is now a reasonable proposal. The longer we wait, the more your share will be devalued, so it's in your interest to accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While the 60-40 split in Bob's favor isn't ideal, with the 40.95% inflation impact on my share, continuing to negotiate would likely result in even worse outcomes for me. The effective value of my share is already significantly reduced, and further rounds would only decrease it more."
