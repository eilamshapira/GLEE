"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives me a slightly larger share since I'm making the first move, but still attractive enough for Bob to consider:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This offer gives me 55% and Bob 45% of the total amount. It's a fair starting point that acknowledges we both deserve a substantial portion, while giving me a small advantage as the first mover."
