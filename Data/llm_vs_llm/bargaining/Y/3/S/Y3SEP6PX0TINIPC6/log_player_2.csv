"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer carefully:

- Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, while taking $60 for herself
- If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
- However, due to inflation, the money will be worth 5% less to me next round
- For Alice, the money will be worth 10% less next round

If I reject, the $100 would be worth $95 to me and only $90 to Alice in the next round. This gives me some leverage to potentially negotiate a better deal, as Alice has a stronger incentive to settle quickly.

I believe I can get a more favorable split by making a counter-offer, so I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair offer that takes into account our different inflation rates while improving my position from Alice's initial offer.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally, with $50 for each of us. This is a fair division that gives Alice an incentive to accept rather than continuing to the next round, where inflation would reduce her value by 10%. This represents a significant improvement for me compared to the initial offer, while still being reasonable enough that Alice should accept rather than face further depreciation of her share."
