"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In this negotiation, I need to be strategic since I'm affected by the 20% inflation per round while Bob isn't. This gives Bob a significant advantage in later rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering a fair 50-50 split of the $10,000. Since I face a 20% devaluation each round, it's in my interest to reach an agreement quickly. This even split respects both our interests and allows us to conclude the negotiation immediately."
