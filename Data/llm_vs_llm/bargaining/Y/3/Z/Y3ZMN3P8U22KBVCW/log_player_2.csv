"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm making the first move. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so there's no inflation loss yet
2. A 40$ gain is reasonable, but could potentially negotiate for better
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
4. However, my purchasing power will decrease by 5% next round
5. After inflation in round 2, even if I got 50$, it would be worth 47.5$
6. Getting 40$ now is better than risking a prolonged negotiation with inflation

Given this analysis, I'll accept the offer. While I might get a slightly better deal by negotiating, the inflation risk makes the current offer reasonable enough.
