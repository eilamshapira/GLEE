"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing that she gets $60 while I get $40. While this isn't an even split, I need to remember that inflation will reduce the value by 5% if I reject and we go to another round. If I reject, the total pot would effectively be worth $95 to me in the next round, meaning even a perfect 50/50 split would only give me $47.50.

Since $40 now is better than potentially getting slightly more in the next round (and risking getting even less if Alice doesn't accept my counter-offer), I'll accept this offer.
