"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that considers the inflation risk for future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because:
1. It's close to a 50-50 split, which is generally seen as fair
2. I'm taking slightly more to account for the 10% inflation risk I face if Bob rejects and we move to the next round
3. It's reasonable enough that Bob should accept rather than risk moving to the next round"
