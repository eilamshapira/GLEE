"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split. It's a generous offer, let's end the game now! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000, keeping $600,000 for herself
2. If I reject and propose next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me
3. In the next round, I'd be dealing with $800,000 in effective value (for me)
4. Even if I proposed a very favorable split next round, I might not get more than $400,000 in real value

While the split isn't perfectly equal, $400,000 is a substantial amount, and the risk of losing value due to inflation makes accepting this offer a reasonable choice. Trying to negotiate for more could result in less real value for me due to the inflation penalty.
