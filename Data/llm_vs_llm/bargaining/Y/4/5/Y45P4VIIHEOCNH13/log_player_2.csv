"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10000 (40%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation per round, my money will be worth less if I wait
4. 5% of $4000 is $200, so next round my money will be worth less
5. This first offer seems quite unfavorable - a 60-40 split in Alice's favor
6. Since it's early in the game and inflation hasn't hit yet, I can afford to negotiate for a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a fair counter-offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split that benefits us both equally""}

Reasoning:
1. A 50-50 split is the most equitable solution
2. While I could try to ask for more, being fair increases chances of acceptance
3. If Alice rejects, my next potential gain will be affected by 5% inflation
4. This offer is better than Alice's initial 60-40 split
5. It's early in the game, but better to reach a fair agreement soon before inflation erodes my gains"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Slightly better deal, consider carefully 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice is now offering $4200 (up from $4000 in first round)
2. However, due to 9.75% inflation, $4200 is now worth $3791.50 to me (4200 * 0.9025)
3. This is actually worse than the first offer in real value
4. We still have 9 rounds left, but inflation is becoming a significant factor
5. Alice seems to be playing strategically, offering small increases while inflation erodes my position
6. I should still reject as this offer is worse in real terms than the first one, but I need to be mindful of the mounting inflation pressure

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""A 52-48 split is more favorable to you while still being fair. Let's agree now before inflation reduces both our potential gains""}

Reasoning:
1. I'm adjusting my strategy from the 50-50 split since Alice rejected it
2. Offering Alice a slight advantage (52-48) might make it more appealing
3. The inflation factor is becoming serious - if this gets rejected, my next potential gain will be worth about 15% less than round 1
4. My $4800 will be worth more now than a larger number in future rounds due to inflation
5. The message emphasizes urgency and mutual benefit
6. This is a reasonable compromise between Alice's last offer (58-42 split) and my previous 50-50 proposal"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hurting you, reconsider this offer 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice is offering $4300, but with 18.55% inflation, it's worth only $3502.35 to me (4300 * 0.8145)
2. The real value continues to decrease significantly
3. Alice is correct that inflation is hurting my position
4. We're now 5 rounds in, with 7 rounds remaining
5. Each future round will reduce my purchasing power by another 5%
6. However, $3502.35 in real value is still lower than what I could get with a better deal in the next round, even accounting for inflation

{""decision"": ""reject""}

But I need to be very careful now - the inflation is becoming a serious threat to my negotiating position."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a more conciliatory offer:

{""bob_gain"": 4600,
""alice_gain"": 5400,
""message"": ""A 54-46 split in your favor is my final reasonable offer. Further delays will significantly hurt my position due to inflation, but will also give you less total value. Let's conclude this now.""}

Reasoning:
1. I'm moving closer to Alice's position (her last was 57-43)
2. With inflation at ~24% next round, I need to reach a deal soon
3. $4600 now is worth more to me than $4700 or even $4800 several rounds later
4. The message emphasizes that delays hurt both of us:
   - Me through inflation
   - Alice because she could get $5400 now instead of slightly more much later
5. This offer represents a good compromise point
6. Given the inflation pressure, this is likely my last chance for a relatively favorable deal"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, this is a good compromise 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice is offering $4100, but with 26.49% inflation, it's worth only $3013.91 to me (4100 * 0.7351)
2. We're now 7 rounds in, with only 5 rounds remaining
3. The real value continues to plummet - my negotiating position is severely weakened
4. Alice is offering less nominal dollars than before ($4100 vs $4300 last time)
5. However:
   - Next round will have 31.49% inflation
   - If we continue much longer, I risk getting even less real value
   - We might risk getting nothing if we reach round 12
6. While this isn't a great offer, the inflation pressure is becoming too severe to ignore

{""decision"": ""accept""}

The inflation has effectively forced my hand. Better to accept $3013.91 in real value now than risk an even worse outcome later."
