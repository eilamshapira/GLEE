"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I believe this is a good starting point for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:
1. Alice is proposing a 40/60 split in her favor
2. While she frames it as ""fair,"" it's notably skewed towards her
3. Since there's no inflation for me, I don't lose value by negotiating
4. I have many rounds left to negotiate a better deal
5. As the second mover in this round, I can make the next proposal if I reject

Given these factors, I believe I can negotiate a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but slightly in my favor since Alice opened with a proposal favoring herself:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I believe a more balanced split would be fair. I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is more equitable than your initial offer.""}"
