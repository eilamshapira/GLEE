5500.0,4500.0,Let's split it fairly considering inflation affects me more. This offer gives you a significant amount while acknowledging my disadvantage.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Since your money loses 20% value each round, this $4000 now (worth $4000 to you) is better than $5500 next round (which would only be worth $3520 to you). This is a fair offer considering the inflation factor.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split it equally. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation affecting me.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Consider this carefully: Due to the 44% inflation affecting you next round, if you reject this, your future gains will be worth significantly less. This $3000 now is worth more to you than $5000 in the next round (which would only be worth $2800 to you). Let's conclude this now to maximize both our actual values.",Bob,4,
