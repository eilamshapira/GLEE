Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since your money loses 20% value each round, this $4000 now (worth $4000 to you) is better than $5500 next round (which would only be worth $3520 to you). This is a fair offer considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Consider this carefully: Due to the 44% inflation affecting you next round, if you reject this, your future gains will be worth significantly less. This $3000 now is worth more to you than $5000 in the next round (which would only be worth $2800 to you). Let's conclude this now to maximize both our actual values. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000
