"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering inflation affects me more. This offer gives you a significant amount while acknowledging my disadvantage. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice wants $5,500, leaving me with $4,500
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. Important factors:
   - Alice loses 20% value each round
   - I don't lose any value
   - Her $5,500 will be worth $4,400 next round
   - My $4,500 stays at $4,500

Since Alice's money will be worth less next round, I have negotiating leverage. I can reject this and offer a better split for myself in round 2, knowing that her share will be worth less to her.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer considering Alice's time pressure due to inflation:

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Since your money loses 20% value each round, this $4000 now (worth $4000 to you) is better than $5500 next round (which would only be worth $3520 to you). This is a fair offer considering the inflation factor.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation affecting me. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice offers a 50-50 split ($5,000 each)
2. Due to 36% inflation for Alice:
   - Her $5,000 is actually worth only $3,200 to her
   - My $5,000 is still worth full value
3. If I reject:
   - Next round, her money will be worth even less (44% less than original)
   - I maintain negotiating advantage
   - I can likely get a better deal next round

Since I have a strong position due to the inflation factor affecting only Alice, and the value of her share is decreasing each round, I can likely get a better deal by rejecting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer that reflects our current positions:

{""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Consider this carefully: Due to the 44% inflation affecting you next round, if you reject this, your future gains will be worth significantly less. This $3000 now is worth more to you than $5000 in the next round (which would only be worth $2800 to you). Let's conclude this now to maximize both our actual values.""}"
