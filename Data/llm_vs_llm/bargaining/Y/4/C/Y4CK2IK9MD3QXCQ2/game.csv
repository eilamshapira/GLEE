900000.0,100000.0,This is my first offer.  I'm hoping for a fair split.,Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I believe a more equitable split would be better for both of us. With inflation affecting both of us (10% for me, 20% for you), this offer gives you $450000 now rather than a potentially lesser amount in future rounds due to the higher inflation rate you face. This is a fair proposal that recognizes both our positions.",Bob,2,
