"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I believe a more equitable split would be better for both of us. With inflation affecting both of us (10% for me, 20% for you), this offer gives you $450000 now rather than a potentially lesser amount in future rounds due to the higher inflation rate you face. This is a fair proposal that recognizes both our positions. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
