"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my first offer.  I'm hoping for a fair split. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's proposal. 

She's offering me $100,000 while keeping $900,000 for herself, which is a 10%-90% split. That's not very balanced.

If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer. However, I need to consider that inflation will reduce the value by 10% for me and 20% for Alice.

In this case, I should reject and make a more equitable offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced counter-offer that accounts for the inflation factors.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I believe a more equitable split would be better for both of us. With inflation affecting both of us (10% for me, 20% for you), this offer gives you $450,000 now rather than a potentially lesser amount in future rounds due to the higher inflation rate you face. This is a fair proposal that recognizes both our positions.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle. This is a fair solution that accounts for the inflation affecting both of us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's new offer.

Alice is now proposing a 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a much more balanced offer than her initial 10%-90% proposal.

I need to consider the inflation effects:
- For me, the money is now worth 19% less than in round 1
- For Alice, the money is worth 36% less than in round 1

If I reject and we go to round 4, inflation will continue to reduce the value for both of us, with Alice being affected more severely by inflation (20% per round vs my 10% per round).

This 50-50 split is reasonable and fair, and considering the inflation factors, accepting now is beneficial.
