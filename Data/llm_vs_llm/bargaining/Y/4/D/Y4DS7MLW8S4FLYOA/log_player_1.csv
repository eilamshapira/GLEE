"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first move.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I think this is a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a substantial share while maintaining a slight advantage for making the first move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer as it's a perfectly fair 50-50 split. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk of both of us getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the rounds limit, and this is a fair and reasonable division."
