"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer strategically. She's offering me $450,000, which is 45% of the total amount, while keeping $550,000 (55%) for herself. 

While this isn't an even 50-50 split, it's a fairly reasonable offer for the first round. Here's why I should consider accepting:
1. It's a substantial amount of money
2. If I reject, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in later rounds
3. There's the risk of getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds
4. The difference from a 50-50 split ($50,000) might not be worth the risk of further negotiation

However, since this is the first round and I'll get to make the next offer if I reject, I think I can try to negotiate for a more equitable split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a perfectly equal split, which is the most fair and rational solution. This shows goodwill while also being completely equitable.
