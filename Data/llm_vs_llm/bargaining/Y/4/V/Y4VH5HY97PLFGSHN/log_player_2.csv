"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which would give each of us $50. This is a fair offer on the surface, but given the inflation dynamics of this game, I should consider the strategic implications.

Since the money devalues by 5% each round for Alice but remains the same value for me, I actually have a slight advantage if we move to the next round. If I reject now, I can make my own proposal next round, when Alice's perceived value of the money will be lower.

I think I can propose a slightly better deal for myself in the next round that Alice would still accept, given the inflation penalty she faces.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice faces a 5% inflation penalty each round but I don't, I'll offer a split that accounts for this dynamic while still being reasonably fair.

If Alice rejects my offer now, we'll move to round 3 where the money will be worth 10% less to her. That means she should be willing to accept slightly less than 50% now rather than facing that additional penalty.

I'll propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which is slightly better for me than Alice's initial 50-50 offer, but still reasonable enough that she should accept it given the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 58 
# Alice gain: 42 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has now offered me $58 and she would take $42. I need to evaluate this carefully.

If I reject this offer, we'll move to round 4 where Alice will face even more inflation (around 15% total), making the money even less valuable to her. This gives me some negotiating advantage.

However, Alice has already improved her offer from the 50-50 split to giving me $58, which is better than the $55 I proposed. She's clearly accounting for the inflation factor and making a reasonable concession.

If I reject and we move to round 4, I could potentially get a slightly better deal, but there's also risk involved in continued negotiation. The $58 offer is already quite good for me.

Given that Alice has made a fair adjustment and offered me more than I asked for in the previous round, I'll accept this offer.
