"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hey Bob, I propose $6,000 for me and $4,000 for you. This way, you'll get a solid share, and we can wrap this up quickly without the value decreasing for you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the 20% inflation, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable. This way, we both get a decent share, and I won't lose too much value in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
