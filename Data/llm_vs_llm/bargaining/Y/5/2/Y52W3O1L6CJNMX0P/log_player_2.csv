"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose to settle the division now: I take $4000 and you receive $6000. Accepting now helps me avoid further inflation erosion of my share while giving you a healthy portion. I believe this is a fair early resolution for both of us. Looking forward to your agreement! 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $6,000 out of the $10,000, which is 60% of the total. That's a decent offer, especially in the first round.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but I need to account for the 10% inflation that affects my share. If I wait until the next round, the total value to me would be worth 10% less, or $9,000 equivalent.

Since this is a reasonable first offer giving me the majority of the money, and considering the inflation penalty I face with each round, I'll accept.
