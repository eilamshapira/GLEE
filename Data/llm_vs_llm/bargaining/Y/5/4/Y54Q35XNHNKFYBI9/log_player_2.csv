"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6552 
# Alice gain: 3448 
Do you accept this offer?","To determine whether I should accept this offer, I need to consider the value of the money in the current round and the potential decrease in value in subsequent rounds.

Given that the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice with each passing round, it's beneficial to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. However, I also want to ensure I receive a fair share.

In this round, Alice offers me $6,552 and takes $3,448 for herself. This means I get approximately 65.52% of the $10,000, and she gets about 34.48%.

Considering it's the first round and the significant decrease in value for both of us in subsequent rounds, I should evaluate if this split is reasonable or if I can negotiate a better deal by proceeding.

Since the offer is somewhat in my favor but not extremely so, and considering the risk of losing value in subsequent rounds, I will choose to reject this offer to see if I can get a better deal in the next round, where I will be the one making the proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given that the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice with each passing round, and considering this is the second round, I need to make an offer that is attractive enough for Alice to accept but still favorable to me.

The original amount was $10,000. After one round, the value for me would be 10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500, and for Alice, it would be 10,000 * 0.90 = $9,000.

To make a compelling offer, I should consider giving Alice a bit more than she offered me in the previous round, but not so much that I compromise my own gain significantly.

Let's propose a split where I gain $5,500 and Alice gains $4,500. This way, I'm offering her more than her previous offer to me, but still maintaining a majority share for myself.
