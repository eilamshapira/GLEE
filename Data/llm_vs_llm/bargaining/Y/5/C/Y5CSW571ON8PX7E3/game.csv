60.0,40.0,"Bob, let's split it 60/40. It's a fair offer and we can avoid losing money to inflation. Let's take the deal!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, considering the inflation, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor this round. It's a bit more than your last offer but still fair given the decreasing value of money. Let's settle this now!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about inflation. To compensate, I'm offering you 35, which adjusted for your 5% loss from last round, is comparable to what you would have received before. I am now worried about my own inflation. Let's secure a reasonable deal now before further losses occur. I need 65.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, inflation is hitting hard, and we're both at risk of losing more. I propose a 50/50 split this round. It's fair and ensures we both walk away with something before the value drops even further. Let's agree on this and end the game!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
70.0,30.0,"Bob, the clock is ticking! I am offering 70 for me and 30 for you. Given your inflation losses, 30 now is better than nothing later. Accept now!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
55.0,45.0,"Alice, we're losing value fast, and I'm feeling the pinch of inflation more than you. I'm willing to compromise with a 45/55 split in your favor. This is a fair deal considering our situation. Let's end this now before it gets worse!",Bob,6,
