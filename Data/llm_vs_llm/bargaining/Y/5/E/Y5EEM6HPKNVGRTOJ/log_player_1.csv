Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the impact of inflation. This offer is fair and considers the urgency. Let's settle before the value decreases further. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical decision. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Each round significantly decreases the value of the money due to inflation. Holding out for a better offer in Round 5 risks a much lower payout even if I get a slightly better split.
* **Bob's Position Weakening:** Bob's offer is getting better, and he's clearly feeling the impact of the faster inflation on his end. It's unlikely he'll offer significantly more in future rounds. 

Accepting a slightly less favorable deal now secures a reasonable amount and avoids the risk of a worse outcome later."
