50000.0,950000.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 1: I take $50000 and you get $950000. Consider that if we delay, the discounting will hurt me much more (10% per round) than it will you (only 5% per round). By accepting now, you secure the full value of $950000 rather than a slightly discounted amount later. I believe this division reflects our respective time‐preferences fairly. Looking forward to your response.",Alice,1,
