"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50000, ""bob_gain"": 950000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 1: I take $50,000 and you get $950,000. Consider that if we delay, the discounting will hurt me much more (10% per round) than it will you (only 5% per round). By accepting now, you secure the full value of $950,000 rather than a slightly discounted amount later. I believe this division reflects our respective time‐preferences fairly. Looking forward to your response.""}"
