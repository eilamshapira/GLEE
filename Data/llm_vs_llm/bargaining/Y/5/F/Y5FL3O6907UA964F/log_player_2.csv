"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 1: I take $50000 and you get $950000. Consider that if we delay, the discounting will hurt me much more (10% per round) than it will you (only 5% per round). By accepting now, you secure the full value of $950000 rather than a slightly discounted amount later. I believe this division reflects our respective time‐preferences fairly. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob gain: 950000 
# Alice gain: 50000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
