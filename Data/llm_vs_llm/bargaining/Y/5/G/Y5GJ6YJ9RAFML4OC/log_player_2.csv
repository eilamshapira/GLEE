"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer where I would receive $400,000 and she would get $600,000. Given that we have inflation reducing my money's value by 10% each round, I need to think strategically.

If I reject now and make a counter-offer next round, even if I ask for more, the 10% inflation means I'd need to get at least $444,444 next round to equal $400,000 now. And there's no guarantee Alice would accept my counter-offer.

$400,000 is a substantial amount, even if it's less than half. Given the inflation risk and uncertainty of future negotiations, I'll accept this offer.
