"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's split this fairly - I'm offering you a solid $40 while I take $60. This is a reasonable deal that avoids any time-wasting negotiations and inflation losses for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, a 50/50 split is the fairest. However, I'm willing to compromise and give you a slight edge. This offer is more reasonable than the previous one, and we should both consider the effects of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response):
- My $45 with 5% inflation is worth $42.75
- If I reject and make a new offer, any amount I receive will be worth another 5% less
- Bob's offer is reasonable given the circumstances
- Further negotiation would likely lead to worse outcomes due to inflation
- Better to accept now than risk further value loss"
