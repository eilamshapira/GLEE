Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly - I'm offering you a solid $40 while I take $60. This is a reasonable deal that avoids any time-wasting negotiations and inflation losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

""alice_gain"": 45,
