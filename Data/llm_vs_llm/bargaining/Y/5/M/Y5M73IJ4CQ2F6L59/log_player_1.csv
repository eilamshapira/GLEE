Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get $55 and you get $45. This way, we both get a good portion of the $100 before any deductions kick in. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I understand that splitting 50/50 seems fair at first glance, but I'm sure you'll agree that the inflation makes things a bit more complicated. How about we try this split instead? It accounts for the fact that the money loses value more quickly for you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 49, ""bob_gain"": 51, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand the inflation angle and how it affects us differently. I'm proposing $49 for me and $51 for you. This helps balance out the faster depreciation on my side while keeping things relatively fair. Let me know your thoughts!""}"
