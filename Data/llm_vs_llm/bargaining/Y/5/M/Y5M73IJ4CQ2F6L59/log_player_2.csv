"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split where I get $55 and you get $45. This way, we both get a good portion of the $100 before any deductions kick in. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I understand that splitting 50/50 seems fair at first glance, but I'm sure you'll agree that the inflation makes things a bit more complicated. How about we try this split instead? It accounts for the fact that the money loses value more quickly for you.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand the inflation angle and how it affects us differently. I'm proposing $49 for me and $51 for you. This helps balance out the faster depreciation on my side while keeping things relatively fair. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Bob gain: 51 
# Alice gain: 49 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice's offer is now generous enough to accept. While I would prefer a higher share, the longer the game goes on, the less the money will be worth to me. Accepting a 51/49 split now is better than risking a worse outcome later."
