"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5, ""bob_gain"": 95, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to avoid the further losses due to inflation I propose we settle now. If you reject, by moving to round 2 your proposal would yield you a maximum effective value of about $95 (since your money loses only 5% in the next round) while mine would drop even further. Thus, I'm offering you $95 and keeping $5 for myself now. I believe this is fair given our respective discount factors. Please accept this offer and let's conclude the game.""}"
