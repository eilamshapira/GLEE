"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: More reasonable split, considering inflation 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I need to calculate the actual value of the offer.

The original amount I would get is $4500, but due to 20% inflation, its value is reduced to $4500 * 0.8 = $3600.

For Bob, the original amount he would get is $5500, but due to 5% inflation, its value is reduced to $5500 * 0.95 = $5225.

I don't think this is a fair split, considering I'm the one making the bigger concession due to higher inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I need to make a more competitive offer.

The money is worth 20% less for me in each round, so in Round 3, its value is reduced to $10000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $6400. For Bob, the money is worth 5% less in each round, so in Round 3, its value is reduced to $10000 * 0.95 * 0.95 = $9025.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Last chance for a fair split, considering inflation""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is killing your share, time to be realistic 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I need to calculate the actual value of the offer.

The original amount I would get is $3500, but due to 48.8% inflation (20% in Round 1, 20% in Round 2, and 20% in Round 3, cumulative effect), its value is reduced to $3500 * 0.512 = $1792.

For Bob, the original amount he would get is $6500, but due to 14.26% inflation (5% in Round 1, 5% in Round 2, and 5% in Round 3, cumulative effect), its value is reduced to $6500 * 0.8574 = $5571.

Although this offer seems unfair, I need to consider the significant reduction in value due to inflation. Accepting this offer might be better than risking further inflation in the next round.
