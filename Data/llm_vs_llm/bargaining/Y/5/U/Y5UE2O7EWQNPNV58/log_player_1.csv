"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for the division of $10,000 in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly, but still offers Bob a significant amount. I'm hoping this will be seen as reasonable and avoid a prolonged negotiation where inflation eats away at our gains."
