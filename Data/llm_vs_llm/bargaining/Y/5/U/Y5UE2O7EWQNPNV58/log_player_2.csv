"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer in light of the 5% inflation per round.

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000, which is 40% of the total.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. That means if I were to get the entire $10,000 in the next round, it would only be worth $9,500 to me.

Since $4,000 now is better than potentially getting nothing if negotiations break down, and considering the inflation penalty for waiting, I'll accept this offer.
