"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to be strategic here, considering the inflation and the limited number of rounds. Since this is the first round, I can afford to be a bit more generous to ensure Bob accepts, while still prioritizing my own gain.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

Explanation:

*   I'm asking for $600,000, which is a good starting point given the total amount.
*   I'm offering Bob $400,000. This is a substantial amount that should incentivize him to accept the offer in the first round, avoiding the risk of inflation and further rounds."
