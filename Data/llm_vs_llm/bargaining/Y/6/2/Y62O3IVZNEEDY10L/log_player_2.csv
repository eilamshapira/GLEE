"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you can still make a good profit. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:
- If I accept now, I get $40
- If I reject, next round I can make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 20% less to me
- After inflation, $40 in the next round would only be worth $32 to me
- Alice is starting with a somewhat aggressive offer in her favor
- However, prolonged negotiation will hurt me due to inflation

While 60-40 split favors Alice, getting $40 now is better than risking further rounds with inflation eating into my share. Making a counter-offer would likely lead to more rounds of negotiation, reducing the real value I receive.
