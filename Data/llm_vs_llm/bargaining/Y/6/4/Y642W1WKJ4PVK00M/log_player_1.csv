"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer for dividing the $100, keeping in mind that with each passing round, the money loses 5% of its value for me due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest this division as it gives both of us a substantial amount, with a slight advantage to me since I'm making the first offer. I believe this is a fair starting proposal that respects both our interests while acknowledging the time pressure of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice that Bob seems to want more than 50% of the share. Since the value is decreasing for me with each round due to inflation (now at about 10% less value), I'll adjust my offer to try to reach an agreement sooner.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm offering Bob a bit more than my initial offer. This seems fair considering the inflation effect on my side, while still maintaining a reasonable amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that Bob is demanding significantly more with each round, while I'm losing value due to inflation (now at about 19% less value for me). I need to find a compromise that acknowledges this reality.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering an even 50-50 split, which is the fairest division possible. Given the inflation affecting my gains, this is already a concession on my part, as my $50 is worth less than Bob's $50. I hope Bob recognizes this as a reasonable compromise."
