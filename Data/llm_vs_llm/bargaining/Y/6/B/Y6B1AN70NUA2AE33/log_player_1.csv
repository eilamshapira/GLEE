"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the total amount is $1,000,000, I'll propose a split where I get 55% and Bob gets 45%. This seems like a fair starting point, considering we have 12 rounds to negotiate.

Here's my offer in JSON format:
```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual values for this round would be:
Alice gain: $500,000 * 0.9 = $450,000
Bob gain: $500,000 * 0.9 = $450,000

Considering Bob's offer gives us an equal split, and taking into account the reduced value due to inflation, I think this is a reasonable proposal.

My response:
{""decision"": ""accept""}"
