"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I suggest a fair 50-50 split this round. Accepting now means you secure $50 immediately, avoiding any uncertainties with inflation. Let's agree now to make sure both our interests are safeguarded. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation, $50 is now worth $40 to me. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth another 20% less.

At this point, accepting $50 (worth $40 to me) is actually quite reasonable, considering:
1. If I reject, my next round's money will be worth even less
2. Bob is offering an equal split
3. Further negotiation might lead to worse outcomes for both of us
