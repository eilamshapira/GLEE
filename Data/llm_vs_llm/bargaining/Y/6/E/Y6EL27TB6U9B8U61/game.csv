60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid multiple rounds where your money loses value due to inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation impact on my end, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable. This way, we both get a significant share and avoid further devaluation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, let's be practical. With 10% inflation impact on your end after two rounds, you should consider accepting this 65-35 split now. Further delays will only reduce the real value of your share.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Alice, I understand your point, but I still think your offer is too skewed. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I need a more balanced split. This 52-48 offer is my attempt at finding middle ground.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
70.0,30.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. Your share has already lost nearly 15% in value due to inflation. If we continue negotiating, your position will only worsen. This 70-30 split actually gives you more real value than what you'd get from a larger share in later rounds.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, I understand the pressure of inflation, but I'm not willing to give up too much. A 50-50 split is the fairest offer I can make, considering we're both trying to maximize our gains. If we don't agree soon, we risk losing everything.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
75.0,25.0,"Bob, we're now in round 7 and your share has lost over 22% of its value. A 25$ share now is worth more to you than a larger share later. We only have 5 rounds left before we both get nothing. This is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
52.0,48.0,"Alice, I know my share's value is decreasing, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to compromise, but a 75-25 split is too extreme. This 48-52 offer is my attempt to find a middle ground. Let's try to find a mutually acceptable solution before it's too late.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
80.0,20.0,"Bob, we're now three rounds from losing everything. Your share has lost over 30% of its value. Even this smaller 20$ share now is worth more than what you'd get from a larger share in the final rounds. Let's not risk walking away with nothing - this is a reasonable offer given the circumstances.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
55.0,45.0,"Alice, I know time is running out, but I'm not willing to accept an 80-20 split. I'd rather try to find a slightly more balanced solution. This 45-55 offer is my last attempt at finding a compromise. If we don't agree now, we risk losing everything in the next two rounds.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
75.0,25.0,"Bob, this is the second-to-last round. I'm softening my previous demand to 75-25 as a final compromise. If you reject this, we'll only have one round left before we both get nothing. Even with inflation, you'll still get real value from this offer. Please consider accepting so we both walk away with something.",Alice,11,
