"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid multiple rounds where your money loses value due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation impact on my end, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable. This way, we both get a significant share and avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since I know Bob's share will be worth less in future rounds due to inflation, which gives me better negotiating power. I can propose a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, 
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. With 10% inflation impact on your end after two rounds, you should consider accepting this 65-35 split now. Further delays will only reduce the real value of your share.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point, but I still think your offer is too skewed. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I need a more balanced split. This 52-48 offer is my attempt at finding middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because Bob's position continues to weaken with each round due to inflation. The 14.26% reduction in value for Bob's share means I can negotiate for a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, 
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. Your share has already lost nearly 15% in value due to inflation. If we continue negotiating, your position will only worsen. This 70-30 split actually gives you more real value than what you'd get from a larger share in later rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the pressure of inflation, but I'm not willing to give up too much. A 50-50 split is the fairest offer I can make, considering we're both trying to maximize our gains. If we don't agree soon, we risk losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because with Bob's share now worth 22.62% less due to inflation, a 50-50 split is not optimal for me. His bargaining position continues to weaken, and I can push for a more favorable split in the next round. With each round, the real value of his share decreases, strengthening my negotiating position."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 75, 
""bob_gain"": 25,
""message"": ""Bob, we're now in round 7 and your share has lost over 22% of its value. A 25$ share now is worth more to you than a larger share later. We only have 5 rounds left before we both get nothing. This is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know my share's value is decreasing, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to compromise, but a 75-25 split is too extreme. This 48-52 offer is my attempt to find a middle ground. Let's try to find a mutually acceptable solution before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. With Bob's share now worth 30.17% less due to inflation, and only 4 rounds remaining, my negotiating position is very strong. A 52-48 split is not attractive when I can likely secure a much better deal in the next rounds, as Bob's share continues to lose value and we get closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 80, 
""bob_gain"": 20,
""message"": ""Bob, we're now three rounds from losing everything. Your share has lost over 30% of its value. Even this smaller 20$ share now is worth more than what you'd get from a larger share in the final rounds. Let's not risk walking away with nothing - this is a reasonable offer given the circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know time is running out, but I'm not willing to accept an 80-20 split. I'd rather try to find a slightly more balanced solution. This 45-55 offer is my last attempt at finding a compromise. If we don't agree now, we risk losing everything in the next two rounds. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. With only two rounds remaining and Bob's share now worth nearly 37% less due to inflation, a 55-45 split is not attractive enough. The combination of severe inflation impact on Bob's share and the imminent deadline should make him more willing to accept a more favorable split for me in the next round. However, I need to be careful not to push too hard as we're getting very close to both walking away with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 75, 
""bob_gain"": 25,
""message"": ""Bob, this is the second-to-last round. I'm softening my previous demand to 75-25 as a final compromise. If you reject this, we'll only have one round left before we both get nothing. Even with inflation, you'll still get real value from this offer. Please consider accepting so we both walk away with something.""}"
