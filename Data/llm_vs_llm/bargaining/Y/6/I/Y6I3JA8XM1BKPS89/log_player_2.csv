"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 4000$ in the first round
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 20% less for me in the next round
3. The inflation rate is much higher for me (20%) than for Alice (5%)
4. If I wait for the next round, my bargaining power will be weaker due to higher inflation impact
5. 40% is a reasonable share, considering Alice has a stronger position due to lower inflation rate

Given these factors, I think it's best to accept this offer. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of losing value through inflation is too high.
