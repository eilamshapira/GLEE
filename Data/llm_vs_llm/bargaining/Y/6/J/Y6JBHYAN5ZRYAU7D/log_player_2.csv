"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. 

Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject, I can make my own offer in the next round. However, I need to consider that inflation will reduce the value of the money by 10% for me and 20% for Alice each round.

If I reject and move to round 2, the $1,000,000 is worth $900,000 to me and $800,000 to Alice. This means Alice is more affected by inflation than I am, which gives me some advantage in later rounds.

Given that we have 12 rounds total and inflation increases with each round, it might be worth making a counter-offer that gives me a better share. Alice's incentive to accept increases as rounds go by due to her higher inflation rate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic offer that accounts for the inflation differences between us. Since Alice faces higher inflation (20% per round vs my 10%), she has a stronger incentive to reach an agreement sooner.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering Alice $450,000 which is 45% of the total. This is still a substantial amount, and considering that inflation affects her more severely than me, accepting this offer now would be better for her than continuing to later rounds where her share would lose more value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider Alice's new offer.

Alice is now offering me $450,000, which is an improvement from her initial $400,000 offer. Due to inflation, this $450,000 is worth 19% less to me than money in round 1, meaning it's effectively worth about $364,500 in round 1 terms.

If I reject and we go to round 4, inflation will increase further (to 27.1% for me and 48.8% for Alice). The inflation difference is growing wider each round, putting more pressure on Alice.

Alice has moved from offering me 40% to offering me 45%. This shows she's willing to negotiate. However, I think I can get a better deal given the inflation asymmetry that benefits my position.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll improve my offer slightly from last time, recognizing that we both have incentives to reach an agreement before inflation erodes too much value, but maintaining my advantageous position in the inflation dynamic.

{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000}

I'm offering Alice $420,000, which is 42% of the total. While this is less than my previous offer, we're now in round 4 where inflation has significantly impacted both of us. Given that Alice faces a higher inflation rate (20% per round vs my 10%), the longer we negotiate, the worse her position becomes. With each passing round, her money loses value faster than mine, making this a reasonable offer considering our current round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's latest offer.

Alice is now offering an even 50-50 split of $500,000 each. Due to inflation in round 5, my $500,000 would be worth approximately $328,050 in round 1 terms (34.39% less). This is less than the effective value of her previous offer of $450,000 in round 3, which was worth about $364,500 in round 1 terms.

However, Alice's position is deteriorating faster than mine due to her higher inflation rate (20% vs. my 10%). Her $500,000 is now worth only about $204,800 in round 1 terms (59.04% less).

If we continue to round 6, inflation would be 40.95% for me and 67.23% for Alice. The gap is widening significantly.

Despite my $500,000 being worth less than her previous offer in real terms, this is a fair 50-50 split of the nominal amount, and further negotiation will erode both our shares considerably.
