"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since this is the first round and I want to make a fair but strategic offer considering the 10% inflation penalty for future rounds, I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because:
1. It's a reasonable balance between fairness and self-interest
2. If Bob rejects, the next round will be worth less to me due to inflation
3. It gives Bob a significant portion to make acceptance attractive"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I will accept this offer. Even with the 10% inflation penalty, I would receive $63 in effective value (70 * 0.9), which is better than my initial offer of $60. If I reject, any future gains would be reduced by at least 20% due to inflation, making it risky to continue negotiating.
