8000.0,2000.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I take $8000 and you get $2000. If you reject, you'll get to propose next round and secure a similar payoff for yourself, while my share will drop 20% in value. With that in mind, accepting now is as good for you as waitingâ€”and it avoids delay. I believe this split fairly reflects our future positions. What do you think?",Alice,1,
