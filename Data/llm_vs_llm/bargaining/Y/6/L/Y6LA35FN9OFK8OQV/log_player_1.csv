"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I take $8,000 and you get $2,000. If you reject, you'll get to propose next round and secure a similar payoff for yourself, while my share will drop 20% in value. With that in mind, accepting now is as good for you as waitingâ€”and it avoids delay. I believe this split fairly reflects our future positions. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since your share drops 20% in value each round, I'm making a more balanced offer. I'll take $6000 and you get $4000. Considering the decreasing value of your share, this might be a good time to accept. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
