"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I take $8000 and you get $2000. If you reject, you'll get to propose next round and secure a similar payoff for yourself, while my share will drop 20% in value. With that in mind, accepting now is as good for you as waitingâ€”and it avoids delay. I believe this split fairly reflects our future positions. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since your share drops 20% in value each round, I'm making a more balanced offer. I'll take $6000 and you get $4000. Considering the decreasing value of your share, this might be a good time to accept.""}"
