8000.0,2000.0,Let's start with a safe division that benefits us both. I propose 80% for me and 20% for you.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,I believe a 50/50 split is fair to start with. We both get $5000 which is substantial. Remember that we both lose if we keep negotiating too long - especially me with the higher inflation rate. This even split respects both our interests.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,accept
