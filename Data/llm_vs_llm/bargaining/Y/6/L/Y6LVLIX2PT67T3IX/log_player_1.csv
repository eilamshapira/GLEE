"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 50/50 split is fair to start with. We both get $5000 which is substantial. Remember that we both lose if we keep negotiating too long - especially me with the higher inflation rate. This even split respects both our interests. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
