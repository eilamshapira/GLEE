"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a safe division that benefits us both. I propose 80% for me and 20% for you. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice proposes that she gets 80% ($8,000) and I get 20% ($2,000) of the total amount.

Given the inflation rates (20% for me and 10% for Alice per round), if I reject this offer, the value of the total amount will decrease for both of us. However, I would get a chance to make a counter-offer in the next round where I could potentially get more than $2,000.

Since this is just the first round and I have the opportunity to propose a more favorable division in the next round, I'll reject this offer. The inflation hasn't had a significant impact yet, so I can still negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a counter-offer that is more advantageous to me while still being reasonable enough for Alice to consider.

Given the different inflation rates (20% for me, 10% for Alice), time works against me more than it does against her. However, I still have leverage to negotiate a better deal than the initial 20/80 split.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I believe a 50/50 split is fair to start with. We both get $5,000 which is substantial. Remember that we both lose if we keep negotiating too long - especially me with the higher inflation rate. This even split respects both our interests.""}"
