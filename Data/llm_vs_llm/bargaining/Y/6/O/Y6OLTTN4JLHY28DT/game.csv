5128.0,4872.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $5128 and you receive $4872. This split reflects the fair outcome in our alternating-offers scenario given that the money loses 5% of its value each round. Accepting now secures your full share without further discounting. Looking forward to your response!",Alice,1,
