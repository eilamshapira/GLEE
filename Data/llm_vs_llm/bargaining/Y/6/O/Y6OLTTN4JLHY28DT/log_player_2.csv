Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $5128 and you receive $4872. This split reflects the fair outcome in our alternating-offers scenario given that the money loses 5% of its value each round. Accepting now secures your full share without further discounting. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 4872 
# Alice gain: 5128
