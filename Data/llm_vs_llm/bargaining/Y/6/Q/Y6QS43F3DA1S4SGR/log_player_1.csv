"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me think strategically about this. Since Bob's money loses 20% value each round, he has an incentive to accept reasonable offers early. However, I don't want to be too generous right away.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I propose this split because while it gives me the larger share, it still offers Bob a meaningful amount that's worth more now than it would be in future rounds due to his 20% depreciation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob offered me $55, which is worth full value to me
2. Bob would get $45, but it's worth 20% less to him due to inflation, so effectively worth $36 to him
3. If I reject, we move to round 3 where I can make an offer, but Bob's value will decrease further
4. I still have a good amount of rounds left, and I might be able to get a better deal
5. Since Bob's money keeps losing value, my bargaining position gets stronger each round

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since we're now in round 3, Bob's money is worth even less to him (40% less than original value). I can use this to my advantage, but I also don't want to be too aggressive and risk further delays.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

This offer gives Bob $30, which due to the 40% depreciation is worth only $18 to him. However, if he rejects this, his next round's money will be worth even less. This should create pressure for him to accept while giving me a good outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 72 
# Bob gain: 28 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
1. Bob is offering me $72, which maintains full value for me
2. This is actually higher than my last offer where I asked for $70
3. Bob would get $28, but it's worth 48.8% less to him due to inflation, so effectively worth about $14.33 to him
4. While I could potentially get more in later rounds due to Bob's increasing inflation, this is already a very good offer for me
5. There's some risk in continuing further, and this offer gives me a clear majority
