"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the effective amount I'm dividing is $80 (100 * 0.8). I'll make an offer based on this.

{""bob_gain"": 45, 
""alice_gain"": 55}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Alice's offer, the $30 I gain is actually worth $30 * 0.64 = $19.2 to me, since the money is worth 36% less.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","The money is worth 20% less for me each round, so after 3 rounds, it's worth 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512 of the original value. 

I'll make an offer based on this. To me, the effective amount is $100 * 0.512 = $51.2. I'll try to get a bit more than half of this effective amount.
