Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 650000

This offer is getting worse for me with each round considering the inflation. I need to push for a better split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000} 

Let's see if Alice is willing to accept a slightly smaller gain to avoid further inflation losses on her end as well."
