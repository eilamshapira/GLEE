5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 55/45 split that favors me slightly since my inflation penalty is much higher (20% vs your 5% per round). This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a good amount without risking further devaluation.",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, considering the inflation penalties, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This reflects the lower penalty I face compared to yours. Let's settle this quickly to minimize losses.",Bob,2,

5300.0,4700.0,"Bob, I understand your position, but your offer was too imbalanced. I'm adjusting my proposal to 53/47 in my favor. This is still fair considering my higher inflation penalty. We've already lost value through two rounds - let's reach an agreement now before we both lose more.",Alice,3,

3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, with each round, your penalty grows significantly more than mine. I'm willing to make a deal, but it needs to account for the fact that my share retains more value over time. Let's settle on this 65/35 split before further inflation erodes our potential gains.",Bob,4,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, your offers are getting more extreme, not more reasonable. The inflation means we both need to compromise quickly. I'm proposing 55/45 in my favor, which accounts for my higher inflation penalty while still being generous to you. If we keep going, we'll both end up with substantially less. This is my best offer - please consider that we need to reach agreement soon.",Alice,5,
