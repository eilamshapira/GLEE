"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering the inflation pressure on both of us but particularly on me.

{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 55/45 split that favors me slightly since my inflation penalty is much higher (20% vs your 5% per round). This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a good amount without risking further devaluation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the inflation penalties, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This reflects the lower penalty I face compared to yours. Let's settle this quickly to minimize losses. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5300,
""bob_gain"": 4700,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but your offer was too imbalanced. I'm adjusting my proposal to 53/47 in my favor. This is still fair considering my higher inflation penalty. We've already lost value through two rounds - let's reach an agreement now before we both lose more.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with each round, your penalty grows significantly more than mine. I'm willing to make a deal, but it needs to account for the fact that my share retains more value over time. Let's settle on this 65/35 split before further inflation erodes our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, your offers are getting more extreme, not more reasonable. The inflation means we both need to compromise quickly. I'm proposing 55/45 in my favor, which accounts for my higher inflation penalty while still being generous to you. If we keep going, we'll both end up with substantially less. This is my best offer - please consider that we need to reach agreement soon.""}"
