"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 55/45 split that favors me slightly since my inflation penalty is much higher (20% vs your 5% per round). This is fair and allows us both to walk away with a good amount without risking further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, considering the inflation penalties, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This reflects the lower penalty I face compared to yours. Let's settle this quickly to minimize losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but your offer was too imbalanced. I'm adjusting my proposal to 53/47 in my favor. This is still fair considering my higher inflation penalty. We've already lost value through two rounds - let's reach an agreement now before we both lose more. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the increasing inflation penalties, I'll adjust my offer to reflect the changing values.

{""bob_gain"": 6500, 
""alice_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Alice, with each round, your penalty grows significantly more than mine. I'm willing to make a deal, but it needs to account for the fact that my share retains more value over time. Let's settle on this 65/35 split before further inflation erodes our potential gains.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offers are getting more extreme, not more reasonable. The inflation means we both need to compromise quickly. I'm proposing 55/45 in my favor, which accounts for my higher inflation penalty while still being generous to you. If we keep going, we'll both end up with substantially less. This is my best offer - please consider that we need to reach agreement soon. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
