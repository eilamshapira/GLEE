"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a proposal for the first round. Given that we're both affected by inflation, it's in our interest to reach an agreement quickly. However, I should also consider the fact that inflation affects Bob more severely (20% per round) than me (10% per round).

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor because we both face diminishing returns if we delay, but you face steeper penalties. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my slight advantage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Let me analyze the situation:

If I accept Bob's offer, I get $45, but it's worth 10% less than it would have been in round 1, so it's effectively worth $40.5 to me.

If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, even if Bob accepts my next offer, the money would be worth another 10% less to me. So if I were to get $60 in round 3, it would be worth $60 × (1-0.1) × (1-0.1) = $48.6 to me. However, there's no guarantee Bob would accept my offer in round 3.

Given that Bob is facing even steeper inflation penalties (20% per round), this offer is reasonable, and continuing the negotiation might lead to diminishing returns for both of us.
