"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I'll try to make a reasonable offer. Considering the initial amount is $1,000,000, after one round, it's worth $800,000 for me.

Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""alice_gain"": 600000}"
