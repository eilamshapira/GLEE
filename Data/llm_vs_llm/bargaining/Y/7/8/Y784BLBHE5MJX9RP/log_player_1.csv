"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's calculate the effective value:

*   **My effective value:** 60 * (1 - 0.05) = 57
*   **Bob's effective value:** 40 * (1 - 0.20) = 32

Now for Bob's offer. 

*   **My effective value:** 50 * (1 - 0.05) * (1 - 0.05) = 45.125

I'm going to compare this to the amount I would have had with the offer. I think I should accept this.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
