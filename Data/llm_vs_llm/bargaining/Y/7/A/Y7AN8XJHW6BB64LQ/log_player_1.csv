"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives me a slight advantage but is still fair enough that Bob might accept it, considering we both face the risk of inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose to take 60$ and give Bob 40$. This is a fair split considering I'm making the first move and we both risk losing value through inflation if we keep negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I'll get $45, but due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $36 to me
- If I reject, we move to round 3 where I can make a new offer, but I'll face 40% inflation on whatever I get
- Bob is offering slightly more to himself (55%) but given the inflation I'm facing, this is actually a reasonable offer
- Waiting for better offers becomes increasingly risky due to compounding inflation on my side

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While it gives Bob a bit more, the inflation penalty makes this a reasonable deal for me, and continuing to negotiate would likely lead to worse outcomes due to increasing inflation."
