"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a fair initial offer to Bob, taking into account that if we don't agree quickly, inflation will reduce the total value.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I suggest we split the money equally. This is a fair division that maximizes our combined gain, and we can avoid the 10% inflation penalty by agreeing now."
