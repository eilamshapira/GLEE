I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a generous offer, but I want to secure a significant portion of the money before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly, aiming for a 60/40 split in my favor. Inflation is starting to affect me more heavily, so I need to secure a larger share to maintain my initial goal."
