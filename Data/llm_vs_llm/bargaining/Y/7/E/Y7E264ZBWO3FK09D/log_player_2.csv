"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer as it's highly unfavorable to me, only giving me 10% of the total amount. Since the inflation penalty is lower for me (5%) compared to Alice's (10%), I can afford to negotiate for a better deal in the next round. I'll make a more balanced proposal next time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a split that gives me a slight majority (55%) while still offering Alice a substantial portion (45%). This is much more balanced than her initial offer. Given that Alice faces a higher inflation penalty (10%) compared to my 5%, she has more incentive to accept this reasonable offer rather than continue negotiating and lose more value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not a 50-50 split, it's a reasonable compromise considering:
1. The money is already worth 9.75% less for me due to inflation
2. If I reject, we'll go to round 4 where my share will be worth even less (14.75% less than initial)
3. Alice has moved significantly from her initial lowball offer of 100k/900k to a more reasonable 400k/600k split
4. Alice's inflation penalty is higher than mine, so this shows she's being more practical

Getting $400,000 (worth about $361,000 after inflation) is much better than risking further rounds of negotiation where both of us would lose more value."
