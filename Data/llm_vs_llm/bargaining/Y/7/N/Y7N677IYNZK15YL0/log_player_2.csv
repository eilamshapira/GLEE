"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I propose 60 for me and 40 for you. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes 60-40 split in her favor
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, any amount I get next round will be worth 10% less
4. If I propose 50-50 next round, my 50 would only be worth 45 due to inflation
5. The current offer of 40 is better than a potentially inflated higher number
