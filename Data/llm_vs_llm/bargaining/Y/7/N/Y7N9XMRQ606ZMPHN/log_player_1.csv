"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'll propose a fair split that considers inflation for me. I suggest we go for this: I take $7,000 and you take $3,000. It's a good way to wrap up quickly before inflation impacts my share negatively. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not comfortable with a 70/30 split. I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me taking 6000 and you taking 4000. This is a fairer division that still accounts for inflation. Let's end this quickly before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5760, ""bob_gain"": 4240, ""message"": ""Thanks for your patience, Bob. Given the inflation impact on my side, I propose 5760 for me and 4240 for you this round. This aligns more closely with how inflation is affecting me, while still improving your share from my last offer. Let's try to settle on this and both come out ahead.""}"
