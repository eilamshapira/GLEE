"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'll propose a fair split that considers inflation for me. I suggest we go for this: I take $7000 and you take $3000. It's a good way to wrap up quickly before inflation impacts my share negatively. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 70/30 split. I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me taking 6000 and you taking 4000. This is a fairer division that still accounts for inflation. Let's end this quickly before the money loses more value.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your patience, Bob. Given the inflation impact on my side, I propose 5760 for me and 4240 for you this round. This aligns more closely with how inflation is affecting me, while still improving your share from my last offer. Let's try to settle on this and both come out ahead. 
# Bob gain: 4240 
# Alice gain: 5760
