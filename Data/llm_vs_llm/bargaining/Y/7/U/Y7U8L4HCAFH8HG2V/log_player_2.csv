"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 4000$ out of 10000$, which means I get 40% while she gets 60%. 

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total amount will be worth 5% less (9500$). However, I'll have the power to propose the split.

Since this is the first round and I have a chance to get a better deal even with the 5% reduction, I'll reject this somewhat unfair offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I should propose a more balanced split, but still slightly in my favor since Alice will face the same dilemma I just faced - accepting my offer or losing 5% value in the next round.

I'll propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which is more equitable than Alice's initial offer while still giving me an advantage.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This offer gives Alice a significant portion ($4500) while being fair enough that she should seriously consider accepting it rather than losing value to inflation in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is now offering me $4500 out of $10000, but it's worth 9.75% less due to inflation
2. Real value of my gain would be approximately $4061 ($4500 * 0.9025)
3. If I reject, we go to round 4 where:
   - I can make an offer
   - But the money will be worth 14.75% less than original value
   - Further negotiation might lead to even more value loss

Alice has improved her offer from the first round (from 4000 to 4500), and considering the inflation penalty, I should probably accept this offer. Continuing the negotiation would mean losing more value to inflation, and we might end up in a worse position.
