This offer is slightly better for Alice than her last one, considering the inflation for me. I'll hold out for a better deal."

This is as good as it's going to get, I think.  The inflation is eating into my share too much, and Alice is unlikely to offer more. Better to take a decent share now than risk getting nothing later."
