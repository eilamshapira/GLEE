6000.0,4000.0,Let's be reasonable and start here. A 60/40 split seems fair.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, waiting hurts my share due to inflation. To avoid further loss on my end, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor: I receive $5500 and you get $4500. I believe this is a fair compromise given the urgency to settle now. What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5700.0,4300.0,"Bob, I understand the time pressure, but your offer wasn't fair considering the initial split I proposed. Let's settle this now with a 57/43 split. It's a win-win before inflation hurts us both further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Alice, the inflation is hitting my share even harder as we delay further. To avoid more losses, I'm proposing a deal a bit more generous than your last: you get $5800, I get $4200. This way you improve on your previous offer and we both settle now before any additional devaluation sets in. What do you say?",Bob,4,
