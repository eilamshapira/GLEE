Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, waiting hurts my share due to inflation. To avoid further loss on my end, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor: I receive $5500 and you get $4500. I believe this is a fair compromise given the urgency to settle now. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand the time pressure, but your offer wasn't fair considering the initial split I proposed. Let's settle this now with a 57/43 split. It's a win-win before inflation hurts us both further.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the inflation is hitting my share even harder as we delay further. To avoid more losses, I'm proposing a deal a bit more generous than your last: you get $5800, I get $4200. This way you improve on your previous offer and we both settle now before any additional devaluation sets in. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This offer is better than my previous offer, even after accounting for the additional round of inflation.  It's important to settle now before inflation erodes the value further. Bob might be more resistant to moving further in my favor in future rounds."
