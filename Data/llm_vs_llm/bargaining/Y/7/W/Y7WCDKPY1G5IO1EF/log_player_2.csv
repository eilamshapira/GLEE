To avoid further loss on my end, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor: I receive $5500 and you get $4500. I believe this is a fair compromise given the urgency to settle now. What do you say?""}"

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the time pressure, but your offer wasn't fair considering the initial split I proposed. Let's settle this now with a 57/43 split. It's a win-win before inflation hurts us both further.

# Alice gain: 5700

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""Alice, the inflation is hitting my share even harder as we delay further. To avoid more losses, I'm proposing a deal a bit more generous than your last: you get $5800, I get $4200. This way you improve on your previous offer and we both settle now before any additional devaluation sets in. What do you say?""}"
