"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I'll take a bit more since I'm making the initial offer. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject and we go to next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me
3. In the next round, I could propose my own split
4. But there's risk in prolonging negotiations due to inflation
5. $400,000 now is better than $450,000 in the next round (which would be worth $405,000 to me due to 10% inflation)

While Alice's offer isn't exactly 50-50, it's reasonable enough considering:
- She made the first move
- The inflation penalty makes immediate acceptance more valuable
- Further negotiation could lead to worse outcomes
