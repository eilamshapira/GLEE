550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that takes into account the different inflation rates. I'll take $550000 and you get $450000. This is actually equitable considering that inflation affects you more (10%) than me (5%). If we go to another round, both of us lose value, so accepting now maximizes our combined benefit.",Alice,1,
