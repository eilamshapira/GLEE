"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that takes into account the different inflation rates. I'll take $550,000 and you get $450,000. This is actually equitable considering that inflation affects you more (10%) than me (5%). If we go to another round, both of us lose value, so accepting now maximizes our combined benefit.""}"
