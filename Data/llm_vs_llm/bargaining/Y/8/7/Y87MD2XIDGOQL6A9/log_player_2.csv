"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that takes into account the different inflation rates. I'll take $550000 and you get $450000. This is actually equitable considering that inflation affects you more (10%) than me (5%). If we go to another round, both of us lose value, so accepting now maximizes our combined benefit. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully, considering our different inflation rates.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the total value decreases by 10% for me and 5% for Alice. That means if I make a counter-offer, I'll be dividing money that's worth less to both of us.

Alice's offer gives me $450,000, which is less than half but accounts for our different inflation rates. If I reject, I'd need to propose a better split for myself in the next round, but the total pie would be smaller due to inflation.

After considering the inflation penalties and the fact that negotiations could reduce the total value further, this offer seems reasonable enough.
