"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer gives us both a good deal. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
- She's offering me $40 and keeping $60 for herself
- While this isn't an even split, it's a reasonable offer
- There's no inflation penalty for me in this round
- Going to future rounds carries some risk and we have a limited number of rounds
- I can make a counter-offer next round, but Alice might be less cooperative if I reject

Since $40 is a decent amount and there's risk in prolonging negotiations, I'll accept.
