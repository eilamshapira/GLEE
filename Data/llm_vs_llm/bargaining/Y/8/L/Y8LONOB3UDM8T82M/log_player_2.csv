"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after each round, I'll make a fair offer. 
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $3500 I would gain is actually worth $5600 in the first round (since 20% less in round 2 and another 20% less of the remaining 80% in round 3, which is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64, so 3500 / 0.64 = 5475, approximately), but still, it seems a bit low. 
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the value of money for me has decreased by 20% twice (round 2 and round 3), which means the money I gain is worth 48% less than in the first round (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). To make a fair offer, I'll take this into account.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $3000 I would gain is actually worth approximately $1232 in the first round (since 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.4096, so 3000 / 0.4096 = 7320, but then considering the 4 rounds of 20% decrease, it's more like 3000 / 0.408 = 7347, and then 7347 * 0.2 * 0.2 * 0.2 * 0.2 = 1178, approximately), but still, it seems too low. 
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the value of money for me has decreased significantly. I'll try to make a reasonable offer, taking into account that I need to get as much value as possible.
{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $2500 I would gain is actually worth very little in the first round, but I need to think about the absolute value. Since the money is worth 73.79% less for me, I would be getting approximately $660 in ""real"" value (considering the decrease). Given the situation, this might be a reasonable offer, but I'll think about it. 
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the value of money for me has decreased drastically. I'll try to make a reasonable offer, taking into account that I need to get as much value as possible. Since the money is almost worthless to me at this point, I'll try to get a larger share.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $2000 I would gain is almost negligible in terms of its real value. However, given that I have only 3 rounds left and the money will continue to devalue rapidly, I should think about accepting a reasonable offer.
