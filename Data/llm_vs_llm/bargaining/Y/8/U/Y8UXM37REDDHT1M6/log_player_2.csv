"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000, which is a 40-60 split. While this isn't an even split, we do have multiple rounds to negotiate, and starting with a rejection might lead to a more favorable outcome. Since this is the first round and I have room to negotiate for a fairer split, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but maintain a cooperative tone.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 50-50 split that benefits us both equally""}"
