"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself since I'm making the first offer, but keep it reasonable to increase chances of acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45 - a fair split considering I'm making the first move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept this offer, I'll get $45, but due to 10% inflation, it's effectively worth $40.50 to me
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less than the original value
- The best I could reasonably hope for in the next round would be around $60, but with 20% inflation that would be worth $48
- There's no guarantee Bob would accept my next offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation

Given these factors, I should accept this offer since the guaranteed $40.50 in effective value is better than the uncertain prospects of future rounds with increasing inflation.
