"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to divide the $100 between Bob and me.

Since we're on the first round, and Bob faces a 5% inflation penalty if we go to the next round, I should take that into account. I want to make an offer that's fair but also advantageous enough for Bob to accept rather than reject and face inflation.
