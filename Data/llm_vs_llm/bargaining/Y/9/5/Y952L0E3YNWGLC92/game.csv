400000.0,600000.0,I propose to split it with me getting $600000 and you getting $400000. This seems like a fair balance considering the inflation factor affecting my side.,Bob,2,

480000.0,520000.0,"Considering the effects of inflation, let's adjust the offer. How about I take $480000 and you take $520000? This way, you get a little extra, and we both move on with a good share.",Alice,3,
