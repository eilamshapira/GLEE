"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's settle this quickly to avoid the effects of inflation on my share. I propose I receive $55 and you get $45â€”a fair division in our first round. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $45
2. If I reject and move to next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * Maximum I could propose would be $100, but worth only $80 to me
   * Alice might reject my proposal, leading to further rounds and more inflation

While $45 is less than half, it's a reasonable first offer. If I reject, even if I propose a better split next round, the 20% inflation means I'd need to get at least $56.25 to match the current $45 value. That's risky as Alice might reject it.

The safe play is to accept this offer now rather than risk further devaluation.
