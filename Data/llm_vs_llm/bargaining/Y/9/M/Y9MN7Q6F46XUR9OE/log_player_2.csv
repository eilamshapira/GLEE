"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split of the $10,000, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to account for the 10% inflation penalty per round.

If I accept now, I get $5,000.
If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, even if I asked for all $10,000 and Alice accepted, I would only get $9,000 due to the 10% inflation.

Since $5,000 now is better than potentially getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds, and the inflation penalty makes delaying costly for me, I'll accept this fair offer.
