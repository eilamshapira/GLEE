"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":80,""bob_gain"":20,""message"":""Let's start with a simple division. I'll take 80% and you can have 20%. It's a fair starting point!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split it closer to the middle. I'll take 60, you take 40. It's still more than half for me, but much fairer than your initial offer. Let's avoid losing value in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
