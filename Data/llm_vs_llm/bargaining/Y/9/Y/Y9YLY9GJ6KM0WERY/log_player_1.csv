"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm Alice, and I want to maximize my earnings while considering the 5% inflation per round. Since this is the first round and I'm making the first offer, I'll aim for a slightly more aggressive split, but still one that Bob might find acceptable to avoid losing value in later rounds due to inflation.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to evaluate this offer carefully. My gain of $4500 is now worth 5% less than it would have been in round 1. That means it's effectively worth $4500 * 0.95 = $4275 in round 1 dollars.

Bob's getting $5500, which is more than I proposed for him originally.

I need to decide if risking another round, where *my* money depreciates further and *he* gets to make the offer, is worth the potential of getting a better deal. Given the information I have, another 5% decrease would be substantial.

Therefore, I will accept this offer.
