"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to consider the decreasing value of the money for me with each round.

Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm proposing a slightly larger share for myself to account for the future inflation that I will suffer. Since it's round 1, the inflation is not significant yet, so I am not being too greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to calculate the real value of this offer for me. $5000 now is worth 5% less than $5000 in the first round, meaning it's worth $5000 * 0.95 = $4750 in round 1 dollars.

Bob is offering a 50/50 split. While it's fair, I need to consider the time value of money for me.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. The money is now worth 10% less for me than in round 1.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

**Explanation:**

I am increasing my share because the inflation is starting to bite. This offer gives me $6000 now, which is worth $6000 * 0.90 = $5400 in round 1 dollars. This is better than Bob's previous offer, and still leaves Bob with a significant amount. I hope he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Alright, let's analyze this. Bob's offering $5200. With the inflation, it's worth $5200 * (1 - 0.1426) = $5200 * 0.8574 = $4458.48 in round 1 dollars.

That's not very good considering I started with $5500 offered to me in round 1.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. The money is now worth 18.55% less for me than in round 1.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500
}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my share again to compensate for the significant inflation.  $6500 now is worth $6500 * (1-0.1855) = $6500 * 0.8145 = $5294.25 in round 1 dollars. I'm trying to get a reasonable amount accounting for the lost value. I understand Bob might be resistant, but I need to prioritize getting a decent share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's see what Bob's offering now. $5300 with a 22.62% loss means it's worth $5300 * (1 - 0.2262) = $5300 * 0.7738 = $4101.14 in round 1 dollars.

That's getting really low. I have to reject this.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, this is getting critical. Inflation is really eating into my potential gains. The money is now worth 26.5% less for me than in round 1.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

**Explanation:**

I know this seems greedy, but I need to make up for the lost value. $7000 now is worth $7000 * (1-0.265) = $7000 * 0.735 = $5145 in round 1 dollars. This is the minimum I can accept to make it worth playing. I risk him rejecting it, but if he does, we're both in trouble."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is offering $5400. With 30.17% inflation, that's worth $5400 * (1 - 0.3017) = $5400 * 0.6983 = $3770.82 in round 1 dollars.

This is unacceptable. We're getting close to the deadline, and his offers are decreasing in real value for me.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","This is getting incredibly tight. The money is now worth 33.66% less for me than in round 1.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500
}
```

**Explanation:**

I know this looks very unfair to Bob, but I'm trying to salvage something here. $7500 now is worth $7500 * (1 - 0.3366) = $7500 * 0.6634 = $4975.50 in round 1 dollars. This is the absolute minimum I can accept given the rounds left and the rate of inflation. If he rejects this, we will likely both end up with nothing. I hope he understands the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","$5500 with 36.98% inflation is worth $5500 * (1 - 0.3698) = $5500 * 0.6302 = $3466.10 in round 1 dollars.

That is terrible! I'm rejecting this. We only have two rounds left.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","We're almost out of time! The money is now worth 40.13% less for me than in round 1.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

**Explanation:**

This is it. My last chance. $8000 now is worth $8000 * (1 - 0.4013) = $8000 * 0.5987 = $4789.60 in round 1 dollars. I'm aware this is heavily skewed, but it's the only way I can get anything close to a reasonable value given the accumulated inflation and the little time remaining. If Bob rejects this, we both get nothing. I really hope he takes it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5600 
# Bob gain: 4400 
Do you accept this offer?","This is it. Last round. Bob is offering $5600. With the inflation of 43.12%, that's worth $5600 * (1 - 0.4312) = $5600 * 0.5688 = $3185.28 in round 1 dollars.

It's an awful offer, but it's better than nothing.
