"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm going to consider this offer carefully. While an even split sounds fair on the surface, I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty that affects only me. If I accept now, I'll get $500,000. If I reject and we continue negotiating, the total value to me decreases by 5% each round, while Alice faces no such penalty.

Given these conditions, accepting this first offer is actually quite reasonable. If I counter-offer in the next round, I'd need to secure more than 500,000/0.95 â‰ˆ $526,316 to come out ahead, which might be difficult to achieve.
