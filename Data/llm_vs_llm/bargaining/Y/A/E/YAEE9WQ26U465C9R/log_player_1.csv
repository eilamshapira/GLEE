"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that seems fair for the first round, considering we have 12 rounds total and I don't know how inflation affects Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally, 50-50. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice Bob is experiencing inflation while I'm not. Since Bob rejected my fair 50-50 split and is trying to get more, I'll make a reasonable counter-offer that accounts for his inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52}

I'm offering you slightly more than half to account for the inflation you're experiencing, while still ensuring I get a fair portion as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 43 
# Bob gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I see that Bob's inflation is increasing with each round - now at 27.1% less value for him. He's asking for increasingly larger shares to compensate. Let me adjust my offer accordingly while still protecting my interests.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm offering you a larger portion (55%) to help offset your increasing inflation rate, which seems fair given our circumstances."
