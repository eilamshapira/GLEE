Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Alice is trying to capitalize on the inflation affecting me, but I still believe I can secure a better deal considering the inflation factor. Let's see how she reacts to my counteroffer.

Send the following to Alice:

{""bob_gain"": 59, ""alice_gain"": 41}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the $59 I proposed last round is now worth approximately $48.

Let's try to find a middle ground:

{""bob_gain"": 57, ""alice_gain"": 43}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Although the $55 is worth approximately $36.14 because of the inflation, I will still accept the offer because getting a diminished amount is better than risking getting nothing at all."
