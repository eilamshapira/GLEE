"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $30 while keeping $70 for herself, which is quite uneven. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me but only 5% less to her.

While $30 is better than nothing, I believe I can get a better deal by negotiating, even accounting for the depreciation. The significant difference in our inflation rates (20% vs 5%) means I should try to reach an agreement relatively soon though.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Given the inflation rates, I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging we need to reach an agreement soon due to my higher depreciation rate.

{""bob_gain"": 45,
""alice_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""Alice, I propose a more balanced split that's fair to both of us. With my higher inflation rate, we should reach an agreement soon, and this offer gives us both a good outcome.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, let's be reasonable. Your money is losing value fast. This offer is a good compromise. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased her offer from $30 to $35
2. Due to 36% inflation for me, the $35 is actually worth about $22.40 in round 1 terms
3. If I reject, my next offer will face even steeper depreciation
4. The gap between our inflation rates (20% vs 5% per round) puts me at an increasing disadvantage
5. Alice is correct that my money is losing value quickly

While I might want a more even split, the high inflation rate affecting me means delaying further could leave me with even less real value. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush, especially with such high inflation.
