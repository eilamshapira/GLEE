"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an initial offer that's reasonable for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split of the $10,000, which gives us each $5,000. This is a fair division that treats us both equally."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more strategic offer considering the inflation effect on Bob's side.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing that I receive $5,500 and Bob receives $4,500. Since Bob faces 20% inflation per round, it's actually in his interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. The $4,500 I'm offering him now is worth more to him than waiting another round when his share would be worth even less due to inflation."
