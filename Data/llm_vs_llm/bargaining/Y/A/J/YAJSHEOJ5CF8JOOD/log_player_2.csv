"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. I'm offering you $45, and I'll take $55. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

In Round 1, there's no inflation effect yet. Alice is offering me $45 while taking $55 for herself.

While it's not exactly a 50-50 split, it's reasonably close. I could reject and make a counter-offer, but:
1. That would trigger 5% inflation, making the total pot worth less
2. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer
3. $45 is a decent amount, and securing it now avoids the risk of ending up with nothing

I'll accept this offer.
