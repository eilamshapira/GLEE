"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to divide the $1,000,000.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging that I have a slight advantage due to inflation affecting him more than me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm compromising from my initial position to move closer to Bob's offer. This is a fair division considering that Bob faces inflation pressure while I don't."
