"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more balanced offer to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal split of the $100, which I believe is fair to both of us. This way we both receive the same amount and can conclude the negotiation without further delay or inflation reducing the value."
