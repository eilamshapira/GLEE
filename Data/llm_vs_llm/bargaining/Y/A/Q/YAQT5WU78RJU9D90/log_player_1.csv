"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a split that accounts for the declining value in future rounds. Since Bob loses more value per round (20% vs my 10%), he has more incentive to accept a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It gives Bob a significant portion ($4000)
2. If Bob rejects, in the next round the total value will be worth less for both of us, especially for him
3. It's a fair compromise that respects both parties' interests"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

In this round, due to inflation:
- My $4000 is worth $3600 (10% less)
- Bob's $6000 is worth $4800 (20% less)

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
- Values will decrease further (my -10%, Bob's -20%)
- The negotiation could drag on, reducing value for both of us
- Bob might reject again, leading to even more losses

Since $3600 is still a substantial amount, and prolonging the negotiation will result in guaranteed losses for both parties, I'll accept this offer.
