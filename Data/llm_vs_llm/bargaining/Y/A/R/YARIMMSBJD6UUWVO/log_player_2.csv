"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we can end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer. Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split, which would give me $5,000. However, with the inflation factor, I need to be aware that if I reject and we go to another round, any money I receive will be worth 10% less to me, while Alice faces no such penalty.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I would need to ask for more than $5,556 to effectively match what $5,000 is worth now. The inflation factor creates pressure for me to accept earlier rather than later.

Given that this is a reasonable first offer and the inflation penalty I face, I'll accept.
