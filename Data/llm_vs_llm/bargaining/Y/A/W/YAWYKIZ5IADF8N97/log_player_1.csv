"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I suggest a fair 50-50 split. This way we both get equal amounts and avoid further inflation reducing our total. With 20% inflation per round, waiting longer hurts us both. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
