"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair deal, 90% for me, 10% for you. It's a good start, and we can work on better terms in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Alice's offer. She proposes that I get 10% ($100,000) while she gets 90% ($900,000).

Given that we have inflation of 20% per round, and this is just the first round, this offer seems quite unbalanced in Alice's favor. If I reject, the total value becomes $800,000 in round 2, and I can make a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced offer that acknowledges the decreasing value due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I suggest a fair 50-50 split. This way we both get equal amounts and avoid further inflation reducing our total. With 20% inflation per round, waiting longer hurts us both.""}"
