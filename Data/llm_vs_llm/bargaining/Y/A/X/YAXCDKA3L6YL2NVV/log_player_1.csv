"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the different inflation rates we face. Since I (Alice) face higher inflation (20%) compared to Bob's 10%, I should propose a slightly higher share for myself to compensate for this disadvantage.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division because it's balanced enough to be likely accepted, while accounting for my higher inflation penalty. If Bob rejects, my share would be worth 20% less in the next round, while his would only be worth 10% less, putting me at a disadvantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
- I get $300,000 at 80% value = $240,000 effective value
- Bob gets $700,000 at 90% value = $630,000 effective value

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
- Any money will be worth another 20% less for me (64% of original value)
- For Bob it will be worth another 10% less (81% of original value)
- This significantly weakens my negotiating position

While Bob's offer is not great, waiting another round would put me at an even bigger disadvantage due to the asymmetric inflation rates. The rapid decay in value (especially on my side) makes it risky to continue negotiating.
