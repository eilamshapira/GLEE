"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering the inflation effect for him.

Since Bob faces a 10% devaluation each round, it's in his interest to agree sooner rather than later. I'll propose a division that's fair but also accounts for this dynamic.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I suggest this split because while an equal 5000/5000 split might seem fairest, Bob needs to consider that if he rejects and we go to another round, his money will be worth 10% less to him. This offer gives him a significant portion while acknowledging the game's structure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer that accounts for the ongoing inflation effect for Bob.

Since we're now in round 3, Bob faces even more pressure from inflation. If he rejects this offer, his money in the next round will be worth about 27% less than in round 1 (10% compound reduction over multiple rounds). I'll make an offer that's better for him than what he'd likely get if we continue, but still fair to me.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split, which is fair on face value. Given the inflation pressure Bob faces, this should be appealing to him as further delays will continue to erode the value of his potential gains."
