"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an equal split of $5,000 each, which seems fair on the surface. However, I should remember that if I reject this offer and we move to the next round, the money's value will decrease by 5% for me due to inflation.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I'll be working with effectively $9,500 in value (for me). Even if I could get a larger share in the next round, I need to weigh that against the guaranteed $5,000 now.

Since the offer is fair and declining would mean working with less total value, I'll accept this offer.
