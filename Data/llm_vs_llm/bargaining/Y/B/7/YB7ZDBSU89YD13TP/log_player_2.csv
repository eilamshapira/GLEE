"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money. This gives us both $500,000, which is a substantial amount. With inflation reducing the value by 5% each round, it makes sense for both of us to reach an agreement soon rather than losing value through prolonged negotiation."
