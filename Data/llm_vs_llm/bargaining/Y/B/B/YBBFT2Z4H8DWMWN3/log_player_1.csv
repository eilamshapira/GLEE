"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a fair offer that splits the money equally, recognizing that inflation will impact my gains in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the money evenly, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a fair division that benefits both of us immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. With 20% inflation affecting my gains, $400,000 now is actually worth the same as $500,000 would have been in the previous round. If I reject and we move to another round, I'll face even greater inflation, so this is a reasonable offer under the circumstances."
