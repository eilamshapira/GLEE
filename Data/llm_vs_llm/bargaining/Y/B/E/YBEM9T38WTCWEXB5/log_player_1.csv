"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to calculate the effective value of the money for me due to inflation.

In Round 1, $6000 was worth its face value. In Round 2, the money is worth 20% less. So $1.00 in Round 1 is now worth $0.80.

Therefore, the offer from Bob is:

*   Alice gets $4500, but it's only worth $4500 * 0.80 = $3600 in terms of Round 1 value.

Considering the limited number of rounds and the decreasing value of money, I have to make a strategic decision. Receiving something is better than receiving nothing.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
