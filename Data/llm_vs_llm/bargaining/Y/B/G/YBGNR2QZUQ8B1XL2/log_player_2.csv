"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to wait! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which would give me $500,000. However, due to inflation, each round reduces the value of my money by 20%. If I reject and make a counter-offer, Alice might reject it too, and we could end up in multiple rounds of negotiations, significantly reducing the value of my final amount.

Let's calculate: If I accept now, I get $500,000. If I reject and we settle in the next round, even if I got more (say $600,000), it would be worth only $480,000 to me after the 20% inflation.

Given the risk of multiple rounds and the fair initial offer, I'll accept.
