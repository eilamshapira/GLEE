16.67,83.33,"Alice, waiting further hurts us both—your money depreciates faster than mine. In light of this, I propose we settle now with an equilibrium split: I receive $83.33 and you receive $16.67. I believe this is the rational, fair outcome given our respective discount factors.",Bob,2,

20.0,80.0,"Alice, further delay only worsens your situation since your money loses 20% per round. Accept this offer: I get $80 and you get $20. This settlement guarantees you an effective value of about $10.24 (20 × 0.512) now rather than risking even steeper losses if we continue. Let's end this quickly for both our sakes.",Bob,4,
