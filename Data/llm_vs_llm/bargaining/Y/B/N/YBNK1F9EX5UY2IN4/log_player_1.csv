Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, waiting further hurts us both—your money depreciates faster than mine. In light of this, I propose we settle now with an equilibrium split: I receive $83.33 and you receive $16.67. I believe this is the rational, fair outcome given our respective discount factors. 
# Alice gain: 16.67 
# Bob gain: 83.33 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, further delay only worsens your situation since your money loses 20% per round. Accept this offer: I get $80 and you get $20. This settlement guarantees you an effective value of about $10.24 (20 × 0.512) now rather than risking even steeper losses if we continue. Let's end this quickly for both our sakes.
