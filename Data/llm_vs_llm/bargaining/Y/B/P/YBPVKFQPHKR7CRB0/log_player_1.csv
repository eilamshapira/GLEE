Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":800000,""bob_gain"":200000,""message"":""Let's have a fair division and settle this quickly. I'll take 80%, but I'm open to negotiation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more equitable split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is much fairer than your initial offer, and we should agree quickly before inflation reduces the value further. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
