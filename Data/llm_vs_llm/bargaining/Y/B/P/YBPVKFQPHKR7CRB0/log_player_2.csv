"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's have a fair division and settle this quickly. I'll take 80%, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is not fair at all. Alice is proposing to take 80% ($800,000) while leaving me with only 20% ($200,000). I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round, even considering the 5% inflation effect. A more equitable distribution would be more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I propose a more equitable split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is much fairer than your initial offer, and we should agree quickly before inflation reduces the value further.""}

The reasoning for this offer: I'm proposing a more balanced split while still trying to get a slight advantage for myself. The 55-45 split is much more reasonable than Alice's initial 80-20 proposal. I'm also reminding Alice about the inflation factor to encourage a quick agreement, as both of us will lose value if we keep negotiating for too long."
