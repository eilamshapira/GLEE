Remember that with each round your share gets discounted by 20% while mine stays the same. I propose you get $10 now—a decent deal compared to a smaller effective amount later—while I take $90.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about the time discount, but $10 was too low. I propose a fair 50-50 split. Even though my share will be worth effectively $40 due to the first round's discount, this is still much more reasonable. We can both walk away with a good outcome without dragging this out further. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to achieve a fair resolution. However, considering that your funds get discounted by 20% each round while mine aren’t, I'm confident that if we move to the next round, I can propose a division that better reflects these dynamics. So, I must reject your 50-50 split proposal for now. Let's continue negotiating.""}"

Round 3

By accepting this offer in Round 3, you secure $2 (worth 2 × 0.64 = $1.28 in effective value) immediately, rather than risking an even poorer deal later when you’re forced into the proposer’s corner with further discounting. I know it might seem small, but given that your future options are extremely limited by the discount, this token offer is actually the best you can expect under these conditions. I hope you agree that locking in a guaranteed (albeit small) sum is better than watching its value erode further. Looking forward to settling this quickly!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer of $2 was even more unfair than your first offer. Yes, I'm affected by the time discount, but that doesn't justify such an extreme split. With the current 48.8% discount (after 3 rounds), my $60 would be worth about $30.72 effectively, while you'd get $40. This is a much more reasonable split considering our situation. Let's not waste more rounds - this offer gives us both a decent outcome. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the continuing discount on your share means that by moving to the next round I can propose a division that better reflects our respective positions. Although your offer gives me $40 now, I can secure an even more favorable split as we move forward. Let's continue to round 5 and work out a deal that recognizes the growing value gap due to the discount.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, we're in round 5 now. As you know, your money’s value is now only 40.96% of its face value—meaning $1 here is worth about 41 cents to you. Looking ahead, if you reject this offer, you'll soon be in the proposer’s seat in round 6, but you'll have to offer me nearly everything since I can secure almost $100 in round 7. In other words, your best alternative to accepting now is practically nothing. With that in mind, I’m proposing that I take $99 and you take $1. I believe this is the best realistic outcome for you given the heavy discount you’re facing. I hope you understand the urgency and accept this offer to avoid even worse results later.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your continued attempts to exploit the time pressure with extremely unfair offers ($1?) are actually costing us both time. Yes, my effective value is reduced to about 32.77% now, meaning my $70 would be worth about $22.94 to me, while you get $30 at full value. This is much more reasonable than your offers of $1-2. If you reject this, we'll both risk losing more in future rounds. Let's be pragmatic and reach a deal that gives us both meaningful value. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, while I understand your perspective regarding the discount in your share, your offer of $30 for me does not reflect the full strategic advantage I hold by waiting for the next round. Given that I remain unaffected by the discount and the fact that in round 7 I’ll be in the proposer’s chair—where I can secure nearly the entire $100 for myself—I must reject this current offer. I believe postponing will only increase the gap in effective value for you, and I’m prepared to make a proposal in round 7 that takes full advantage of that dynamic.""}"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, we’re now in Round 7. As you know, every round that passes reduces the value of any money you receive. Right now, any dollar you get is worth only about 26% of its face value (0.8^6 ≈ 0.262). If you reject this offer, you’ll move to Round 8 as the proposer—but in that round the discount will be even steeper (roughly 0.8^7 ≈ 0.210), and I will be in a much stronger position in subsequent rounds. In fact, by waiting you risk ending up with almost nothing effective at all. With a nominal $1 coming your way now, you’d net roughly 26 cents in effective value, which is likely better than the near-zero outcome waiting on your turn in Round 8. I’m offering you a 99 to 1 split—it's harsh, but given the compounding discount on your share, it’s the best you can expect. I suggest you accept this deal to avoid further devaluation.""}"

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while the discount is severe (79% now), your repeated $1 offers are still mathematically inferior to what I can propose. My $80 share would be worth about $16.80 effectively to me, while you get $20 at full value. This is a much better deal than the $0.26 effective value you offered. We have 4 rounds left - continuing with extreme offers risks both of us getting nothing. This offer gives you a guaranteed $20, which is better than risking further rounds. Let's reach a reasonable agreement now. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $20 in my hands isn’t as attractive as what I can secure in the upcoming round when I propose the division. With your money losing even more value in future rounds, I’ll be in a far stronger position in Round 9 to claim almost the entire $100. For that reason, I must reject this deal and encourage us to move on to the next round.""}"

Round 9

To put things in perspective, any dollar you receive right now is effectively worth about 16.78 cents (since your discount factor is roughly 0.1678). If you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in Round 10, but you'll be forced to offer me nearly everything—because I know that in Round 11, as the proposer, I can claim almost the entire $100 without any discount. In effect, your best alternative after rejecting is to get about $1 nominally (worth roughly 13.42 cents in Round 10), which is worse than what I'm offering now. Therefore, I propose a division of $99 for me and $1 for you. I believe this is the most rational and beneficial outcome for you given the rapidly diminishing value of your share. I hope you'll accept and avoid further erosion of your funds.""}"

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're in the endgame now. With the current 86.58% discount, my $85 would be worth about $11.47 to me, while you get $15 at full value. You're right that you have a strong position in round 11, but consider this: if you reject this offer, we'll only have 2 rounds left. The risk of getting nothing becomes real for both of us. This offer gives you a guaranteed $15 now, which is better than risking deadlock in the final rounds. Let's avoid the risk of mutual destruction and settle now with both of us getting something meaningful. 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement, but $15 on my end is far below what I can secure in the next round. With me unaffected by the discount and set to propose in Round 11, I can guarantee myself nearly the full $100 by offering you a token amount—something you’d hardly be able to improve upon given the deepening discount on your funds. I’m therefore rejecting your offer and look forward to making my proposal in the next round.""}"

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 20, ""bob_gain"": 80, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, we're now at Round 11. Here's how I see it: if you reject, you'll get to propose in Round 12. However, by then the discount on your share will be even steeper—just about 8.59% of its nominal amount. As the proposer in Round 12, you could grab almost the entire $100 nominally, but that only nets you an effective value of roughly $8.59. In contrast, if you accept this offer now, you'll receive $80 nominal, which—given your current discount factor of about 10.74%—yields an effective value of approximately $8.59 as well. Since waiting only exposes us both to further risk, I'm offering you exactly what you'd get if you held out to Round 12. To avoid an even riskier run to the end, I propose a clean division: I take $20 and you receive $80. I believe this is the fair, rational outcome given the situation. I look forward to your acceptance.""}"
