"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's settle this now. Remember that with each round your share gets discounted by 20% while mine stays the same. I propose you get $10 now—a decent deal compared to a smaller effective amount later—while I take $90. I believe you’ll agree that locking in $10 today beats risking further discount. Looking forward to your acceptance! 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is correct that my share will be worth 20% less each round, while hers won't be affected. However, $10 out of $100 is quite a low offer.

Even with the 20% discount per round, if I reject and propose a more equitable split in the next round (like $50-$50), my effective gain would be $40 (after the 20% discount), which is much better than $10.

The risk of rejection exists, but starting with such a low counter-offer gives me room to negotiate down while still getting more than $10.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your point about the time discount, but $10 was too low. I propose a fair 50-50 split. Even though my share will be worth effectively $40 due to the first round's discount, this is still much more reasonable. We can both walk away with a good outcome without dragging this out further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, time is not on your side—each passing round costs you 20% in value. By accepting this offer in Round 3, you secure $2 (worth 2 × 0.64 = $1.28 in effective value) immediately, rather than risking an even poorer deal later when you’re forced into the proposer’s corner with further discounting. I know it might seem small, but given that your future options are extremely limited by the discount, this token offer is actually the best you can expect under these conditions. I hope you agree that locking in a guaranteed (albeit small) sum is better than watching its value erode further. Looking forward to settling this quickly! 
# Bob gain: 2 
# Alice gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","This is an even worse offer than before! Alice is trying to use the time pressure against me, but her reasoning is flawed.

Even with the 36% discount currently in effect, if I make a counter-offer of say $60-$40 in the next round, my effective gain would be $60 × 0.64 = $38.4, which is significantly better than the $1.28 effective value she's offering.

Yes, the discount is a factor, but it doesn't justify accepting such an extremely unfair split. There are still 9 rounds left, and while my position weakens with time, I still have enough leverage to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more moderate offer that acknowledges the time pressure while still maintaining a reasonable position.

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer of $2 was even more unfair than your first offer. Yes, I'm affected by the time discount, but that doesn't justify such an extreme split. With the current 48.8% discount (after 3 rounds), my $60 would be worth about $30.72 effectively, while you'd get $40. This is a much more reasonable split considering our situation. Let's not waste more rounds - this offer gives us both a decent outcome.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, we're in round 5 now. As you know, your money’s value is now only 40.96% of its face value—meaning $1 here is worth about 41 cents to you. Looking ahead, if you reject this offer, you'll soon be in the proposer’s seat in round 6, but you'll have to offer me nearly everything since I can secure almost $100 in round 7. In other words, your best alternative to accepting now is practically nothing. With that in mind, I’m proposing that I take $99 and you take $1. I believe this is the best realistic outcome for you given the heavy discount you’re facing. I hope you understand the urgency and accept this offer to avoid even worse results later. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is trying to exploit the time pressure, but her logic still doesn't hold up completely. 

Let's analyze:
1. Currently, my $1 would be worth $0.41 due to the 59.04% discount
2. If I reject and propose in round 6, with a 67.23% discount, even a $70 share would still be worth about $22.95 effectively
3. Alice claims she can secure almost $100 in round 7, but that assumes I would accept an even worse offer then
4. We still have 7 rounds left, and while my position weakens, accepting $0.41 effective value is still worse than trying for a better deal

Even though time is against me, $0.41 effective value is too low to accept when I can still propose better alternatives.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Alice, your continued attempts to exploit the time pressure with extremely unfair offers ($1?) are actually costing us both time. Yes, my effective value is reduced to about 32.77% now, meaning my $70 would be worth about $22.94 to me, while you get $30 at full value. This is much more reasonable than your offers of $1-2. If you reject this, we'll both risk losing more in future rounds. Let's be pragmatic and reach a deal that gives us both meaningful value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, we’re now in Round 7. As you know, every round that passes reduces the value of any money you receive. Right now, any dollar you get is worth only about 26% of its face value (0.8^6 ≈ 0.262). If you reject this offer, you’ll move to Round 8 as the proposer—but in that round the discount will be even steeper (roughly 0.8^7 ≈ 0.210), and I will be in a much stronger position in subsequent rounds. In fact, by waiting you risk ending up with almost nothing effective at all. With a nominal $1 coming your way now, you’d net roughly 26 cents in effective value, which is likely better than the near-zero outcome waiting on your turn in Round 8. I’m offering you a 99 to 1 split—it's harsh, but given the compounding discount on your share, it’s the best you can expect. I suggest you accept this deal to avoid further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice continues with the same extreme strategy, but let's analyze carefully:

1. Current discount is 73.79%, meaning her $1 offer is worth about $0.26
2. If I reject and propose in round 8, with a 79% discount:
   - Even a $80 share would be worth $16.8 effectively
   - This is still much better than $0.26

While my position continues to weaken, and Alice is correct about the mathematics of the discount, accepting $0.26 in effective value is still worse than making another proposal.

The key is that even with the severe discount, I can still propose splits that would give me more effective value than her current offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 80,
""alice_gain"": 20,
""message"": ""Alice, while the discount is severe (79% now), your repeated $1 offers are still mathematically inferior to what I can propose. My $80 share would be worth about $16.80 effectively to me, while you get $20 at full value. This is a much better deal than the $0.26 effective value you offered. We have 4 rounds left - continuing with extreme offers risks both of us getting nothing. This offer gives you a guaranteed $20, which is better than risking further rounds. Let's reach a reasonable agreement now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, we're now in Round 9. To put things in perspective, any dollar you receive right now is effectively worth about 16.78 cents (since your discount factor is roughly 0.1678). If you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in Round 10, but you'll be forced to offer me nearly everything—because I know that in Round 11, as the proposer, I can claim almost the entire $100 without any discount. In effect, your best alternative after rejecting is to get about $1 nominally (worth roughly 13.42 cents in Round 10), which is worse than what I'm offering now. Therefore, I propose a division of $99 for me and $1 for you. I believe this is the most rational and beneficial outcome for you given the rapidly diminishing value of your share. I hope you'll accept and avoid further erosion of your funds. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's carefully analyze the situation, as we're getting into the final rounds:

1. Current discount is 83.22%, making Alice's $1 offer worth $0.17
2. If I reject and propose in round 10 (86.58% discount):
   * Even an $85 share would be worth $11.47 effectively
   * This is still significantly better than $0.17

However, Alice's point about Round 11 is important - she could indeed propose an even more extreme split then, and my bargaining power would be very weak.

Still, accepting $0.17 in effective value now is worse than making one more attempt at a better deal. Even if she rejects my next offer and comes back with another $1 offer in round 11, I wouldn't be much worse off than accepting $0.17 now.

You're right that you have a strong position in round 11, but consider this: if you reject this offer, we'll only have 2 rounds left. The risk of getting nothing becomes real for both of us. This offer gives you a guaranteed $15 now, which is better than risking deadlock in the final rounds. Let's avoid the risk of mutual destruction and settle now with both of us getting something meaningful.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 89.26% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, we're now at Round 11. Here's how I see it: if you reject, you'll get to propose in Round 12. However, by then the discount on your share will be even steeper—just about 8.59% of its nominal amount. As the proposer in Round 12, you could grab almost the entire $100 nominally, but that only nets you an effective value of roughly $8.59. In contrast, if you accept this offer now, you'll receive $80 nominal, which—given your current discount factor of about 10.74%—yields an effective value of approximately $8.59 as well. Since waiting only exposes us both to further risk, I'm offering you exactly what you'd get if you held out to Round 12. To avoid an even riskier run to the end, I propose a clean division: I take $20 and you receive $80. I believe this is the fair, rational outcome given the situation. I look forward to your acceptance. 
# Bob gain: 80 
# Alice gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a significant shift in Alice's strategy and her reasoning is sound. Let's analyze:

1. Current offer: $80 with 89.26% discount = $8.59 effective value
2. If I reject and propose in round 12 (91.41% discount):
   * Even if I proposed to take the full $100, it would be worth $8.59 effectively
   * And Alice would likely reject such an extreme offer, leading to both of us getting nothing

Alice has finally made a reasonable offer that:
1. Matches the maximum effective value I could get in the final round
2. Eliminates the risk of both of us getting nothing
3. Shows she's willing to take a smaller share ($20) to reach agreement

This is actually the best outcome I could hope for at this point, and the math checks out.
