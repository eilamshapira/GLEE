"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that considers both our interests and the inflation pressure. Since Bob faces higher inflation (10% vs 5%), he might be more inclined to accept a reasonable offer now rather than wait.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this 60-40 split in my favor, as it's better for both of us to reach an agreement sooner rather than later due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate this offer:

1. If I accept now:
   * I get $45, at 95% value = $42.75 effective value
   * Bob gets $55, at 90% value = $49.50 effective value

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * The money will be worth even less (90% and 85% of original value)
   * Even if I propose a better split, Bob might reject again
   * Further delays reduce both our potential gains

While this isn't as good as my initial proposal, it's still a reasonable offer given the inflation pressure. The difference between this and my original proposal (after accounting for inflation) isn't large enough to risk another round of depreciation.
