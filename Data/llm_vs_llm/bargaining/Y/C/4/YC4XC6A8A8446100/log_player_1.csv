"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This round offers you the best chance to secure a significant amount before inflation erodes the value further. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 5% inflation, if I accept the offer, my $4000 would be worth $4000 * 0.95 = $3800.

Since Bob's offer gives me $4000, which is worth $3800 to me, and I think I can get a better deal, I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, and it's already worth 10% less than the original value (5% in Round 1 + 5% in Round 2), I'll try to make a more favorable offer to Bob while still considering my own losses.

In this round, the money I gain is worth 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of its original value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. This offer gives you a bit more, but still allows me to get a significant share before inflation reduces its value further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's important to reach an agreement soon. This offer gives you a reasonable amount considering inflation's impact on future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept the offer, my $3800 would be worth $3800 * 0.8574 = $3257.12 (since 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.8574, which represents the 14.26% reduction in value).

While Bob's offer gives me $3800, which is worth $3257.12 to me, I still think I can negotiate a better deal. Bob's message suggests that he's getting anxious to reach an agreement, which might give me an advantage in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 14.26% less for me in this round, and I've rejected Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a more competitive offer to Bob while still considering my own losses.

In this round, the money I gain is worth 0.8574 of its original value. To calculate the value in the next round, I'll consider that it will be worth 0.8574 * 0.95 = 0.8145 of its original value if we proceed to Round 6.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, 
""bob_gain"": 5800, 
""message"": ""Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. This offer gives you a significant share, but still allows me to get a reasonable amount before inflation reduces its value even further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm holding firm on this offer. Accepting now would still give you a decent amount, but delaying further will only hurt your position. 
# Alice gain: 3700 
# Bob gain: 6300 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept the offer, my $3700 would be worth $3700 * 0.7738 = $2863.66 (since 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.7738, which represents the 22.62% reduction in value).

While Bob's offer gives me $3700, which is worth $2863.66 to me, I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. However, I still think I can try to negotiate a slightly better deal. Bob's message suggests that he's trying to intimidate me into accepting, but I'll try to hold out for one more round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 22.62% less for me in this round, and I've rejected Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a more competitive offer to Bob while still considering my own losses.

In this round, the money I gain is worth 0.7738 of its original value. To calculate the value in the next round, I'll consider that it will be worth 0.7738 * 0.95 = 0.7346 of its original value if we proceed to Round 8.

Here's my offer for Round 7:

{""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Bob. Inflation is eating away at my potential gains. I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need something reasonable to make it worth my while. This is my final compromise offer.""}"
