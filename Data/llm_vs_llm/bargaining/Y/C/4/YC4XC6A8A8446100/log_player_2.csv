# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm holding out for a slightly better offer. While the difference is getting smaller, time is still on my side as the inflation only affects Alice."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6300, ""alice_gain"": 3700, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm holding firm on this offer. Accepting now would still give you a decent amount, but delaying further will only hurt your position.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be realistic, Bob. Inflation is eating away at my potential gains. I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need something reasonable to make it worth my while. This is my final compromise offer. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right, it's time to be realistic.  While I was holding out for a slightly higher amount, accepting a 60/40 split now guarantees a good payout before inflation further erodes Alice's share and forces her to offer even less."
