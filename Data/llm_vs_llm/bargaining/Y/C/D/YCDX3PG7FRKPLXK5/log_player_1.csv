"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more since I'm making the first offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a perfectly fair 50-50 split. This way we both get an equal share, and it's still early enough that inflation shouldn't be a major concern for either of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The 50-50 split is fair, and with only 10% inflation impact so far, accepting $500,000 now (worth $450,000 to me after inflation) is better than risking further rounds where inflation will reduce my gains even more. Additionally, if we keep rejecting offers, we risk getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement."
