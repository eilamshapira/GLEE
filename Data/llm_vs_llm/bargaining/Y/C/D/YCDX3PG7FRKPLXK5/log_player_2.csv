"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair split where I get slightly more since I'm making the first offer. This way we can both walk away with a substantial amount without risking inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:

1. She's offering me $450,000, which is a substantial amount
2. She's taking $550,000, asking for a $100,000 premium for making the first offer
3. I don't know how inflation affects Alice, but I know it doesn't affect me
4. We have 11 more rounds if needed
5. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round

While $450,000 is a good amount, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I can afford to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer since there's still plenty of time to negotiate and inflation doesn't affect me:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I propose a perfectly fair 50-50 split. This way we both get an equal share, and it's still early enough that inflation shouldn't be a major concern for either of us.""}"
