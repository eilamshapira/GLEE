"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. I propose a 60/40 split. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $400,000, Alice gets $600,000
2. If I reject, next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000 effective value for me
   * I could propose a split, but Alice could still reject
   * Further rounds would continue to reduce value for me

Given that:
- This is a decent first offer (40% of the pot)
- The time pressure is only on me due to inflation
- Further negotiations would reduce my potential gains
- Alice has no incentive to accept a better deal later
