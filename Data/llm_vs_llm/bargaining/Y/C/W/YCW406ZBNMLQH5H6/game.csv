5000.0,5000.0,"Let's go for an equal split, 50-50. It's fair for both of us considering the inflation impact on my side.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you than the next round",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Given the inflation, my 4500 is worth less each round. This split is more reasonable considering my losses. Let's settle this before it gets worse for me.",Bob,4,

7000.0,3000.0,"Inflation is taking its toll, this might be the best you'll get",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"With inflation hitting hard, 4000 for me is now worth much less. This is a fair compromise considering the circumstances. Let's end this before it's too late.",Bob,6,

7500.0,2500.0,"You're losing value fast, this is likely your best remaining option",Alice,7,

6500.0,3500.0,"We're running out of time, and my share is losing value rapidly. 3500 is a significant compromise from my side given the inflation. Let's agree before it's too late for both of us.",Bob,8,

8000.0,2000.0,"Inflation is crippling your share, this is likely the last decent offer you'll get",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
7000.0,3000.0,We're down to the wire. My 3000 now is worth a fraction of what it was. This is a last-ditch effort to find a middle ground before we both end up with nothing.,Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
8500.0,1500.0,"This is likely your last chance, inflation has decimated your share, take what's left",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
7500.0,2500.0,This is our last chance. My 2500 is now worth almost nothing due to inflation. Let's agree on this before we both walk away with nothing.,Bob,12,
