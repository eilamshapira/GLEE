"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 9900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor. While it's getting late in the game, accepting such a low offer would set a bad precedent and likely lead to even worse offers from Alice in the future.  I'm hoping she'll be more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500} 

I am lowering my ask slightly, but still aiming for a slightly greater share given the increasing impact of inflation on my end."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5905 
# Alice gain: 4095 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While not ideal, this offer is now within a reasonable range given the inflation working against me. Accepting now avoids the risk of walking away with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
