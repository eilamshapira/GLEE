"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, no need to wait 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer of an even 50-50 split is fair and straightforward. While I could reject and make my own offer next round, the 10% inflation penalty means we'd only be dividing 90$ instead of 100$ in the next round. Even if I got a larger percentage then, the absolute amount might be less than the 50$ being offered now.
