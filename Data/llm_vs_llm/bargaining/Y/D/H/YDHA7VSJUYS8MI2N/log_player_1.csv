"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, how about an even 50/50 split? This ensures we both get an equal share, and we avoid further losses from inflation. Let's agree on this and wrap it up swiftly! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
