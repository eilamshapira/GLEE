"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, let's go 55/45. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer is worth 10% less to him in each round, and this is the third round, the money he receives will be worth 10% less than in the second round, which was already 10% less than in the first round. So, the total decrease in value for Bob is 19% (10% in the first decrease and 9% of the remaining 90% in the second decrease).

Considering this, I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Time is money, let's end this""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
