550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, to beat the inflation penalty and secure our shares early, I propose that I receive $550000 while you get $450000. I believe this offers a fair balance given that delaying further will reduce our eventual value. Looking forward to your response.",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe a 50-50 split is fairer considering the inflation rates affecting us both. This way, we can both secure a significant amount before the value drops further. What do you think?",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. Considering the steep discount I'll face if we delay further (my share dropping 20% per round), your current proposal of a 50-50 split gives me an effective value of $400000 in today’s terms. That’s more favorable than the likely outcomes if we prolong negotiations. I accept your offer.",Alice,2,accept
