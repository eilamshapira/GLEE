"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to beat the inflation penalty and secure our shares early, I propose that I receive $550,000 while you get $450,000. I believe this offers a fair balance given that delaying further will reduce our eventual value. Looking forward to your response.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe a 50-50 split is fairer considering the inflation rates affecting us both. This way, we can both secure a significant amount before the value drops further. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. Considering the steep discount I'll face if we delay further (my share dropping 20% per round), your current proposal of a 50-50 split gives me an effective value of $400,000 in today’s terms. That’s more favorable than the likely outcomes if we prolong negotiations. I accept your offer.""}"
