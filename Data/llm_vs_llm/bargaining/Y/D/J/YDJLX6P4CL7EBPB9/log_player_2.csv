"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to beat the inflation penalty and secure our shares early, I propose that I receive $550000 while you get $450000. I believe this offers a fair balance given that delaying further will reduce our eventual value. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
