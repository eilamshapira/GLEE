"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a relatively fair offer, but keeping a bit more for myself since I'm making the first move.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this division because it's close to equal while giving me a slight advantage. It's a reasonable starting point that respects both parties."
