"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to consider the declining value of the money for me while Bob's value remains constant. To maximize my potential gain while also making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept, I will start with a relatively generous offer to ensure a higher chance of acceptance early on.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is 5000 for me and 5000 for him. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, the 5000 is effectively worth 4500 to me compared to round 1. My previous offer would have given me 6000 in round 1 money.

Accepting this offer gives me 5000 * 0.9 = 4500 in round 1 money. Rejecting it means I risk further inflation and potentially getting less in future rounds. However, I think I can get a better deal.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, the money is now worth 20% less to me than in Round 1. Bob rejected my initial offer and I rejected his, so we both are risking losing value. Given this, I need to be more strategic but also more aggressive. I will offer him a slightly better deal than before, but still prioritize maximizing my own gain, considering the decreased value to me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is 4500 for me and 5500 for him. My money is now worth 27.1% less than in round 1. This means that 4500 is effectively worth 4500 * (1-0.271) = 4500 * 0.729 = 3280.5 in round 1 money. This is a very bad offer for me.
```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Alright, things are getting tight. My money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, and Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of that. I need to make a more appealing offer to him while still accounting for the increasing inflation for me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is 4200 for me and 5800 for him. My money is now worth 40.95% less. This means that 4200 is effectively worth 4200 * (1 - 0.4095) = 4200 * 0.5905 = 2480.1 in round 1 money. That's terrible. I have to believe I can still negotiate a slightly better deal given that we're nearing the halfway point.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, this is getting serious. My money is worth 40.95% less now. I need to make a more compelling offer, but I'm also getting desperate.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5300,
  ""bob_gain"": 4700
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to squeeze me dry. My money is now worth 52.17% less. His offer of 4000 is effectively worth 4000 * (1 - 0.5217) = 4000 * 0.4783 = 1913.2 in round 1 money. I'm losing badly here. Still, accepting this is better than nothing.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, things are dire. My money is worth 52.17% less. I need to make a deal before it's too late. I have to be realistic, but I also need to try and get as much as I can.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5100,
  ""bob_gain"": 4900
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer of 3800 is now worth only 3800 * (1 - 0.6126) = 3800 * 0.3874 = 1472.12 in round 1 money. This is an awful offer, but I'm running out of time. I have to try one more time to get something better.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, this is it. I'm almost out of time, and my money is worth 61.26% less. I have to make an offer that Bob can't refuse, even if it means getting significantly less than I initially hoped for.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```"
