"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me $4,000, it's not an equal split of the $10,000. Given that Alice faces a 10% decrease in value each round while I don't face any inflation penalty, I can afford to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split that acknowledges the inflation factor affecting Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of the total amount. This is fair and gives each of us $5,000. Since you're affected by 10% inflation per round, it's in your interest to reach an agreement soon rather than continuing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has improved her offer slightly, giving me $4,200 instead of $4,000. However, this still isn't a fair split of the $10,000. Since I don't face any inflation penalty while Alice's value decreases by 10% each round, I can continue negotiating for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing that I receive $5,500 and you receive $4,500. This is a reasonable compromise considering the inflation factor affecting you. With each round, your portion loses 10% value, so reaching an agreement now means you'll still get good value from your share. This offer is better than continuing negotiations for several more rounds where your potential gains would be worth significantly less to you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me to $4,500, which shows we're moving closer together in our negotiations. However, I still believe we can reach a more favorable agreement given that I don't face any inflation penalty while Alice's value continues to decrease with each round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200}

I'm proposing I receive $5,800 and you receive $4,200. At this point, due to the inflation affecting you, the longer we negotiate, the less value you'll receive from any amount. We're now in round 6, and your money has already lost over 34% of its value. This offer gives you a substantial portion while recognizing the time pressure you face. A quick agreement now ensures you get more value than waiting for future rounds where your gains would be worth even less to you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to $4,700, which shows continued progress in our negotiations. However, given that I don't face any inflation penalty while Alice is now losing nearly 47% of her value due to inflation, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I'm proposing I receive $6,000 and you receive $4,000. At this point, with us now in round 8, your portion has lost nearly 47% of its value due to inflation, and that will continue to worsen. This offer of $4,000 to you, while less than what you've been asking for, is actually more valuable than a larger amount several rounds from now would be. Given that we only have 4 rounds left and your money loses 10% value each round, accepting a deal now is becoming increasingly urgent for you. This offer reflects the significant advantage I have by not facing inflation penalties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to $4,900, which is very close to a 50-50 split. Considering we're now in round 9 and the money has lost nearly 57% of its value for Alice while maintaining full value for me, this is becoming a more reasonable offer. However, given my advantageous position in these negotiations, I'll continue to push for a slightly better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6200, ""alice_gain"": 3800}

I'm proposing I receive $6,200 and you receive $3,800. We're now in round 10 of 12, and your money has lost nearly 57% of its value due to inflation. With only two rounds remaining after this one, the time pressure is significant. This offer of $3,800 to you now is worth more than a larger amount in the final rounds would be due to the continuing 10% inflation per round. Given my position of not facing any inflation penalty, this is a reasonable offer that acknowledges the reality of our situation. A quick resolution now would be beneficial for you before further value is lost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has offered an even 50-50 split of $5,000 each. Given that we're now in round 11 of 12 (the second-to-last round), and Alice's money has lost over 65% of its value while mine maintains full value, this is a reasonable offer. If I reject and we go to the final round, there's a risk we won't reach an agreement and both get nothing. Considering the circumstances and the limited negotiation time remaining, I'll accept this offer.
