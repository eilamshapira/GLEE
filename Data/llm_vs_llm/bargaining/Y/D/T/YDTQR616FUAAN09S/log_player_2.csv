"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's divide it 60/40. I think this is fair as I'm making the first offer. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice is offering me 40% ($400,000) of the $1,000,000, while she keeps 60% ($600,000).

If I reject and move to the next round:
- The money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation
- $1,000,000 × 0.8 = $800,000 would be the effective total value to me
- But I would get to make the counter-offer

While 40% isn't ideal, if I reject, even if I proposed a 50/50 split in the next round (which Alice might reject anyway), my maximum potential would be $500,000 × 0.8 = $400,000.

Given the inflation effect and the uncertain nature of further negotiations, accepting $400,000 now seems more rational than risking a potentially worse outcome later.
