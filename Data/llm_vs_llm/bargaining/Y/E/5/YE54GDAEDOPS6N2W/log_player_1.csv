"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose this split because it's reasonably fair while giving me a small advantage as the first mover. If Bob rejects this, we'll both lose value due to the 5% inflation, so it's in his interest to accept a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer because it's essentially the reverse of my initial offer, but now with a 5% penalty. With inflation reducing the value each round, I'll make a new proposal in the next round, but we should try to reach an agreement soon to avoid losing too much value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that we're now in round 3 and the money is worth about 10% less than initially, I'll make a more balanced offer to encourage agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose an equal split because continuing to negotiate will only reduce the value further for both of us. This is a perfectly fair division that should be acceptable to both parties, and it's better to agree now than to lose more value to inflation."
