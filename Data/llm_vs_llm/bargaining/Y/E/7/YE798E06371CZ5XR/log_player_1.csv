"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I understand I'm playing as Alice in a sequential bargaining game. Given that:
1. Time pressure affects both players (5% depreciation for me, 10% for Bob)
2. Bob's money depreciates faster than mine
3. We both get nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

I'll make a somewhat aggressive but reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a 60-40 split in my favor, which:
- Gives Bob a substantial portion
- Accounts for my stronger negotiating position (money devalues slower for me)
- Leaves room for negotiation if Bob refuses"
