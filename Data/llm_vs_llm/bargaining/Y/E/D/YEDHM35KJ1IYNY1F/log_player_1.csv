"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55.56, ""bob_gain"": 44.44, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $55.56 and you receive $44.44. This split reflects our future bargaining power given the 20% discount each round. Accepting now ensures you get $44.44 rather than a discounted amount later. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering the 20% inflation per round, I propose a split where I get $55 and you get $45. This round, the total value has decreased, so it's important we agree soon. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
