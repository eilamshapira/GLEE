"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $55.56 and you receive $44.44. This split reflects our future bargaining power given the 20% discount each round. Accepting now ensures you get $44.44 rather than a discounted amount later. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 44.44 
# Alice gain: 55.56
