Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I propose a slightly better split for me to account for potential inflation over time, but still leaving you with a substantial amount.

# Bob gain: 5500

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, inflation is a real concern for me. My previous offer was closer to fair considering it. I am increasing my share slightly to compensate for the risk I am taking by playing along. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough decision, and ideally, I'd hold out for a slightly better offer. However, several factors push me to accept:

* **Severe Inflation:** With each round, the value of my potential winnings plummets. Accepting $4,000 now is significantly better than risking another round and potentially getting an even worse offer.
* **Bob's Stance:** His language (""final offer"") suggests he's unlikely to budge further.  
* **Unknown Factor:** I don't know how inflation affects Bob. If he's also experiencing devaluation, his offer might be more reasonable from his perspective. 

While not ideal, accepting minimizes my losses at this point."
