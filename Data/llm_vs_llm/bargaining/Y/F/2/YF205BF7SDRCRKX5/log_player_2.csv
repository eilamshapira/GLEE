"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 9500 
# Alice gain: 500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The offer is very favorable to me (95% of the total amount), and with the 5% inflation penalty per round, it's best to accept a good offer early. This division gives me $9,500 which is much more than what would typically be considered fair (50-50 split). There's no reason to risk losing value to inflation or potential worse offers by rejecting this generous proposal."
