"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me propose a fair split that considers the inflation factor. Since Bob faces higher inflation (10% per round) compared to my 5%, he might be more inclined to accept a reasonable first offer rather than wait.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It's a moderate advantage for me while still giving Bob a significant portion
2. If Bob rejects, his next round money will be worth 10% less, while mine only 5% less
3. This gives Bob a clear incentive to accept now rather than delay"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Due to inflation, if I accept this offer:
   * My $45 is worth $42.75 (95% of original value)
   * Bob's $55 is worth $49.50 (90% of original value)

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * Further inflation will apply (10% more for Bob, 5% more for me)
   * I could propose a different split, but Bob might reject again

3. This offer, even with inflation, still gives me a significant portion ($42.75)

4. The risk of further negotiations might lead to more value loss for both parties

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer because the current value is reasonable, and further negotiation rounds would decrease the total value for both of us due to inflation."
