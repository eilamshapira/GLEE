Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, the effective amount is $100 * 0.9 = $90. For Alice, it's $100 * 0.95 = $95. 

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the original $100 and split it in a way that seems reasonable, given that I've already rejected Alice's offer.
