"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 100, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, given that any delay reduces what I receive while you face no discount, I propose you take the full $100 now. I believe this is fair, as your alternative when you get to propose later is effectively the same outcome.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest way to start, considering the inflation factor that affects you more than me. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your fair offer. Given that any delay further reduces my share's value, I appreciate that splitting evenly now avoids additional loss. I accept your offer of $50 for me and $50 for you.""}"
