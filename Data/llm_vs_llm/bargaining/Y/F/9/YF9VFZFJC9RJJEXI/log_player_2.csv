"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given that any delay reduces what I receive while you face no discount, I propose you take the full $100 now. I believe this is fair, as your alternative when you get to propose later is effectively the same outcome. 
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
