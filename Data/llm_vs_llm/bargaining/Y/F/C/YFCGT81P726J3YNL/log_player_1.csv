"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis that takes into account the 20% discount to the total “pot” in every round, a (roughly) equilibrium division in round 1 is as follows. In round 1 the full amount is $100. If Bob were to reject, he would become the proposer in round 2—when only $80 is available—and his best reply in the subsequent rounds would eventually lead him (as responder in round 1) to expect roughly $48.26. Therefore, to make Bob indifferent (and to “buy” his acceptance), my offer gives him about $48.26 while I keep about $51.74.

Here is my offer in the required JSON format:

{""alice_gain"": 51.74, ""bob_gain"": 48.26}"
