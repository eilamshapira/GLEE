"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game and the deflation aspect for me. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob $4000, which is a significant amount. Since it's the first round and the deflation is not yet significant, I'm trying to secure a larger portion for myself while still making it an attractive offer for Bob to accept immediately. This gives me a larger initial gain before deflation hits me in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob's offer is $4000 for me and $6000 for him. Considering the 20% deflation for me, $4000 now is worth $3200 in round 1 dollars.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is not good enough. I need to account for future rounds of deflation if I keep rejecting, and I believe I can get a better offer, or at least propose a better one myself next round. $3200 is too low for me to accept at this point."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to propose again. My money is now worth 40% less than in round 1. Taking that into consideration, I need to ensure I get a higher amount to compensate for the loss of value.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm proposing $7000 for myself and $3000 for Bob. While it may seem like I'm being greedy, the $7000 is only worth $4200 in round 1 dollars (7000 * 0.6). I need to secure a larger portion to make up for the increasing deflation. Offering Bob $3000 is still a considerable amount, and I hope he sees the logic behind my proposal considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offering me $3500, while he gets $6500. Let's calculate the value of his offer in Round 1 dollars: $3500 * (1 - 0.488) = $3500 * 0.512 = $1792.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

$1792 is far too low for me to accept. The deflation is really starting to hurt, and I'm confident I can get a better deal, even if it means pushing it to another round. I'm hoping that Bob starts realizing the impact of deflation on my side and adjusts his offers accordingly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. The money I gain is now worth 59.04% less than in the first round. This is getting very serious.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm proposing a split of $8000 for me and $2000 for Bob. This might seem extreme, but let's calculate the value of my gain in Round 1 dollars: $8000 * (1 - 0.5904) = $8000 * 0.4096 = $3276.8. So, I'm effectively only getting about $3277 in Round 1 terms.

I'm offering Bob $2000, which is still a decent amount. I'm hoping he understands the severity of the deflation for me and accepts this, as I might have to offer him even less in the future to make it worthwhile for myself. I'm playing to win, and I can't let all the money evaporate due to the deflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is offering me $3000 and taking $7000 for himself. Let's calculate what that $3000 is worth in Round 1 dollars: $3000 * (1 - 0.6723) = $3000 * 0.3277 = $983.10.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

$983.10 in Round 1 dollars is absolutely unacceptable. The deflation is crippling me, and Bob's offer is completely ignoring the reality of the situation. I'm rejecting this offer and hoping that I can still salvage something from this game. I have to assume Bob is trying to get as much as he can for himself, and he's not considering the very real value loss I am experiencing. I'm going to have to make him a very difficult offer next round to get him to agree."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. The deflation is brutal. My money is now worth 73.78% less than in Round 1.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm proposing a very skewed split: $9000 for me and $1000 for Bob. Let's calculate the real value of my share: $9000 * (1 - 0.7378) = $9000 * 0.2622 = $2359.80. So, I'm really only getting around $2360 in Round 1 dollars.

While $1000 for Bob may seem low, it's either that or risk both of us getting nothing. I'm hoping he understands that this is the only way for me to get any reasonable amount considering the heavy deflation. I am not sure if he will accept but it is my only bet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is $2500 for me and $7500 for him. Let's calculate the real value of his offer to me: $2500 * (1 - 0.7903) = $2500 * 0.2097 = $524.25.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

$524.25 in Round 1 dollars is insulting. At this point, I'm practically giving away money. Bob is clearly not taking the deflation into account and trying to take advantage of the situation. It's a gamble, but I believe I have to reject this offer. If I don't get more, I might as well get nothing. I'm running out of rounds, but I'm hoping I can make him see reason soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","This is getting desperate. My money is now worth 83.22% less than in Round 1. I need to make a drastic offer.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9500,
  ""bob_gain"": 500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm proposing $9500 for me and only $500 for Bob. Let's see what that $9500 is really worth: $9500 * (1 - 0.8322) = $9500 * 0.1678 = $1594.10.

I'm only effectively getting about $1594 in Round 1 dollars. This is the lowest I can go and still make it worthwhile. Bob might reject this, but I have to try. Maybe he'll take the $500 rather than risk getting nothing. This is the only play I have left, really. Time is running out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is offering me $2000, while he gets $8000. Let's calculate what that $2000 is worth in Round 1 dollars: $2000 * (1 - 0.8658) = $2000 * 0.1342 = $268.40.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

$268.40 in Round 1 dollars is a complete joke. It is obvious Bob is trying to take everything, and is not considering the deflation. I'm rejecting this with the expectation that we will get nothing at the end of the game. I'm only rejecting in protest."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, one round before the end. My money is now worth 89.26% less than in Round 1. This is a last-ditch effort.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9999,
  ""bob_gain"": 1
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $9999 for me and $1 for Bob. This is utterly ridiculous, I know. Let's see what that $9999 is worth: $9999 * (1 - 0.8926) = $9999 * 0.1074 = $1073.89.

So, I'm getting effectively about $1074 in Round 1 dollars. This is the absolute minimum I am willing to accept, and Bob has to see that. It is likely he will reject this offer, but at least I tried to salvage something in the face of such heavy loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1500 
# Bob gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, it's the last round. Bob's offering me $1500, while he gets $8500. Let's calculate what that $1500 is worth in Round 1 dollars: $1500 * (1 - 0.9141) = $1500 * 0.0859 = $128.85.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

$128.85 is an absolutely pathetic amount. At this stage, it is an insult. Since this is the last round, if I reject this offer we both get nothing. But, since I am getting next to nothing either way, I would rather we both get nothing. I refuse to accept that amount."
