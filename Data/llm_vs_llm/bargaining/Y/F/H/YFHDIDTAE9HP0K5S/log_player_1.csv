Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a proposal for Round 1.

I'm offering Bob $450,000 which is a substantial amount, while I take $550,000. This is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us significant value. Since I face 5% inflation per round, it makes sense for us to reach an agreement quickly rather than extending negotiations."
