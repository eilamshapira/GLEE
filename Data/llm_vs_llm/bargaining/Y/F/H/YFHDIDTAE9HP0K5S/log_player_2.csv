"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider Alice's offer:

Bob's gain: $450,000
Alice's gain: $550,000

This is close to a 45%-55% split. While not exactly even, it's a reasonable first offer. I need to consider:

1. I'd get a substantial amount ($450,000)
2. There's no inflation for me, so delaying doesn't increase my potential share
3. If I reject, I make the next offer, but Alice might reject too
4. Without knowing Alice's inflation rate, it's hard to predict her future decisions

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer. $450,000 is a significant amount and the split is reasonably fair.
