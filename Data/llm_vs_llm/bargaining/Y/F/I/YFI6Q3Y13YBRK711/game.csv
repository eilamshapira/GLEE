600000.0,400000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm proposing a more balanced split. Since inflation affects me at 20% per round versus your 5%, time is more costly for me. This 40/60 split is fair considering our different positions. We both benefit from an early agreement.",Bob,2,

850000.0,150000.0,"Okay, I understand your perspective. Let's split the difference from the last round. I'm willing to give you more, but I need a bigger share to make it worthwhile for me.",Alice,3,

650000.0,350000.0,"Alice, I appreciate you moving in my direction, but the offer is still too unbalanced given our different inflation rates. My money is already worth 48.8% less than round 1, while yours is only 14.3% less. This 35/65 split acknowledges you get the larger share while being fair to both of us. Let's avoid further inflation losses by agreeing now.",Bob,4,

800000.0,200000.0,"I'm still trying to be fair here, Bob. Inflation is hurting you more, but it's also hurting me. Let's make a reasonable compromise, or we're both going to end up with nothing.",Alice,5,

700000.0,300000.0,"Alice, I see we're making progress, but we need to reach a compromise faster. My inflation rate is quickly eroding my position (67.2% less value for me now vs. only 22.6% for you). This 30/70 split acknowledges the asymmetric inflation while giving you the larger share. If we don't agree soon, my effective gain will be minimal regardless of percentage, making any deal unattractive to me. Let's finalize this now.",Bob,6,
