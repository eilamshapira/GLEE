Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm proposing a more balanced split. Since inflation affects me at 20% per round versus your 5%, time is more costly for me. This 40/60 split is fair considering our different positions. We both benefit from an early agreement. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving in my direction, but the offer is still too unbalanced given our different inflation rates. My money is already worth 48.8% less than round 1, while yours is only 14.3% less. This 35/65 split acknowledges you get the larger share while being fair to both of us. Let's avoid further inflation losses by agreeing now.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're making progress, but we need to reach a compromise faster. My inflation rate is quickly eroding my position (67.2% less value for me now vs. only 22.6% for you). This 30/70 split acknowledges the asymmetric inflation while giving you the larger share. If we don't agree soon, my effective gain will be minimal regardless of percentage, making any deal unattractive to me. Let's finalize this now. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000
