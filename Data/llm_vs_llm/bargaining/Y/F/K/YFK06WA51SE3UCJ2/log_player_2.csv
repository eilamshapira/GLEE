"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Since inflation affects Alice's value by 10% each round but doesn't affect my value:
- Current offer for me: $450,000
- Current offer for Alice: $550,000

If I reject and we go to next round:
- Alice will only value any amount at 90% of current value
- I can potentially negotiate a better deal since time pressure affects her more
- I maintain full value of any amount

Given I have this advantage, I should reject this offer and propose a split more in my favor next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's value of money decreases by 10% each round, I can use this to negotiate a better deal for myself. In this round, Alice will value any amount at 90% of its original value.

I'll propose a split that gives me more, but still makes it rational for Alice to accept rather than risk another 10% decrease:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

This means:
- I get $600,000 (full value for me)
- Alice gets $400,000 (worth $360,000 to her due to 10% inflation)

If Alice rejects this, her next offer would need to give her significantly more to make up for the additional 10% loss in value. This makes my offer more likely to be accepted."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

For me:
- Offered $500,000 at full value
- I'm not affected by inflation

For Alice:
- Offered $500,000 but it's worth only 81% of original value to her (about $405,000 in round 1 terms)
- If I reject, next round her value will decrease by another 10%
- She's already showing willingness to compromise from her initial position

While this is better than her first offer, I still have a strong negotiating position because:
1. I'm not affected by inflation
2. Each round makes Alice's position weaker
3. She's already moved from 450k to 500k for my share

I believe I can get an even better deal in the next round as Alice's time pressure increases.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Alice has now faced three rounds of inflation (money is worth 27.1% less to her), and she's shown willingness to move to a 50-50 split, I'll push for a stronger position but not so extreme that she'll definitely reject:

{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}

My reasoning:
1. For me, I get $650,000 at full value
2. For Alice, she gets $350,000, but due to 27.1% inflation, it's worth about $255,150 to her
3. If she rejects, she'll face another 10% loss in value next round
4. My offer is still better than what she might get after another round of inflation
5. The fact that she offered 50-50 last round shows she's becoming more willing to compromise

This offer balances between maximizing my gain while still giving Alice enough incentive to accept rather than risk further devaluation of her share."
