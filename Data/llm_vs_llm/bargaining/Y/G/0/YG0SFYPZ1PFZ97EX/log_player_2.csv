"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split of the $10000. This gives us both $5000, which seems equitable. Since inflation affects me by 20% each round, delaying would reduce the value of my share. Let's make a fair deal now and both walk away with equal amounts. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, while your 50/50 split sounds fair, I'm facing some pressure from inflation on my end. Would you be open to a 55/45 split, giving me $5500 and you $4500? This way, I'm slightly cushioned from the inflation impact, and we both still walk away with a good deal.""
