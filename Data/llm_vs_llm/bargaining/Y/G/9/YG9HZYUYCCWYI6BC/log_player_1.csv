"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a split that acknowledges both the time pressure and inflation affecting me. Since each round decreases the value by 10% for me, I should aim for a fair but decisive first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split because while it gives me a larger share, it still offers Bob a substantial amount that should be appealing enough to accept. The slightly higher portion for me accounts for the inflation risk I face if negotiations drag on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this carefully:
1. Due to 10% inflation for me, if I accept this 500k-500k split now:
   * My 500k is actually worth 450k to me (90% of original value)
   * Bob's 500k is still worth 500k to him
2. If I reject, I can make another offer next round, but my money will be worth even less (80% of original value)
3. There's no guarantee Bob will accept a better offer from me, and we're losing value with each round
4. A 450k-500k effective split isn't terrible, considering we need to reach agreement within 12 rounds

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not as good as my initial proposal, the inflation penalty makes it reasonable to accept now rather than risk further value loss in subsequent rounds."
