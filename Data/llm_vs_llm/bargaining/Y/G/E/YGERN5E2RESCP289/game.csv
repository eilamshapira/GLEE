60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose a 60/40 split. Given the inflation and limited rounds, this is a reasonable starting point to ensure we both get something. Let me know what you think!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but 60/40 is too skewed at the beginning. Let's aim for a more equitable 55/45 split. This is still a good deal for you considering the circumstances. What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
57.0,43.0,"Bob, I've considered your counteroffer, and while I appreciate you moving closer to my initial proposal, I'm still feeling the pressure of inflation. I can offer 57 for me and 43 for you. This considers the declining value of the money for me each round. What do you think?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Alice, I am also affected by inflation! I understand your position, but 57/43 is still unfair to me. How about we compromise at 52/48? This gives you a little more, acknowledging your concerns, but also ensures I get a fair share considering the dwindling rounds. This is a better deal for both of us, considering time is running out.",Bob,4,
