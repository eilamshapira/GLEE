"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but 60/40 is too skewed at the beginning. Let's aim for a more equitable 55/45 split. This is still a good deal for you considering the circumstances. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I am also affected by inflation! I understand your position, but 57/43 is still unfair to me. How about we compromise at 52/48? This gives you a little more, acknowledging your concerns, but also ensures I get a fair share considering the dwindling rounds. This is a better deal for both of us, considering time is running out.
