"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose a 60/40 split. Given the inflation and limited rounds, this is a reasonable starting point to ensure we both get something. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation, but 60/40 is too skewed at the beginning. Let's aim for a more equitable 55/45 split. This is still a good deal for you considering the circumstances. What do you say?""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've considered your counteroffer, and while I appreciate you moving closer to my initial proposal, I'm still feeling the pressure of inflation. I can offer 57 for me and 43 for you. This considers the declining value of the money for me each round. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 52,
""alice_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Alice, I am also affected by inflation! I understand your position, but 57/43 is still unfair to me. How about we compromise at 52/48? This gives you a little more, acknowledging your concerns, but also ensures I get a fair share considering the dwindling rounds. This is a better deal for both of us, considering time is running out.""
