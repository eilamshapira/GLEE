55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing an immediate split: I receive $55 and you get $45. This deal secures our portions before any devaluation occurs due to inflation. I believe it's a fair offer given the risks of waiting. Let's make sure we both benefit by agreeing now!",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Hi Alice, I think we can do better than that.  I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This takes into account the possibility of inflation, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's make a deal!",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for your proposal. However, I'm not satisfied with receiving $40. Considering the fact that my share doesn't depreciate while the value of your share does, I believe we can structure a division that reflects the future devaluations better. Let's continue to negotiate in the next round!",Alice,2,reject
90.0,10.0,"Hi Bob, here's my offer for this round: I take $90 and you get $10. Since your share’s value is reduced by 20% in this round, your effective amount is $8—and if we delay further, the inflation penalty will only worsen your outcome. I believe this deal improves your position compared to waiting. Let’s settle now and avoid further losses!",Alice,3,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable here. Inflation is hitting us both, and I'm not going to accept another lopsided deal. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is fair considering the circumstances, and we can both walk away with something.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob, a 50/50 split is indeed a fair proposition in these circumstances. I'll accept your offer – this way, we both secure a deal without risking further losses due to inflation. Let's finalize the agreement!",Alice,4,accept
