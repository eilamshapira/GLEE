"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing an immediate split: I receive $55 and you get $45. This deal secures our portions before any devaluation occurs due to inflation. I believe it's a fair offer given the risks of waiting. Let's make sure we both benefit by agreeing now!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think we can do better than that.  I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This takes into account the possibility of inflation, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your proposal. However, I'm not satisfied with receiving $40. Considering the fact that my share doesn't depreciate while the value of your share does, I believe we can structure a division that reflects the future devaluations better. Let's continue to negotiate in the next round!""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my offer for this round: I take $90 and you get $10. Since your share’s value is reduced by 20% in this round, your effective amount is $8—and if we delay further, the inflation penalty will only worsen your outcome. I believe this deal improves your position compared to waiting. Let’s settle now and avoid further losses!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable here. Inflation is hitting us both, and I'm not going to accept another lopsided deal. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is fair considering the circumstances, and we can both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, a 50/50 split is indeed a fair proposition in these circumstances. I'll accept your offer – this way, we both secure a deal without risking further losses due to inflation. Let's finalize the agreement!""}"
