"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing an immediate split: I receive $55 and you get $45. This deal secures our portions before any devaluation occurs due to inflation. I believe it's a fair offer given the risks of waiting. Let's make sure we both benefit by agreeing now! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think we can do better than that.  I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This takes into account the possibility of inflation, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's make a deal!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my offer for this round: I take $90 and you get $10. Since your share’s value is reduced by 20% in this round, your effective amount is $8—and if we delay further, the inflation penalty will only worsen your outcome. I believe this deal improves your position compared to waiting. Let’s settle now and avoid further losses! 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable here. Inflation is hitting us both, and I'm not going to accept another lopsided deal. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is fair considering the circumstances, and we can both walk away with something.""}
