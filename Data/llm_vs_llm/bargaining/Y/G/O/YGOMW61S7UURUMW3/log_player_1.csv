"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that considers the inflation penalty I face.

{""alice_gain"": 5300, ""bob_gain"": 4700}

I suggest this division because I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face in future rounds. A fair split would ideally be 50/50, but if we delay to the next round, the total value decreases for me while remaining the same for Bob. This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while protecting me from the inflation risk."
