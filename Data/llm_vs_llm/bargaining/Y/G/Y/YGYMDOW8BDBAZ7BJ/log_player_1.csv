"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think a fair 50-50 split makes the most sense. We both walk away with half a million dollars. This is much more equitable than your initial offer, and if we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose value due to my 5% inflation penalty. Let's be reasonable and split it fairly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
