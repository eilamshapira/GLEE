"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. You get a small amount to show I'm not greedy, but I'll take the lion's share. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer gives me only $1,000 out of $1,000,000, which is just 0.1% of the total sum. While I need to be mindful of the 5% inflation per round, this offer is extremely unbalanced.

Since this is the first round and I have several more opportunities to negotiate a fairer split, I should reject this highly unfavorable offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to propose a more balanced split while accounting for the 5% inflation per round. Since we're now in round 2, I should acknowledge the inflation factor but also aim for fairness.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I think a fair 50-50 split makes the most sense. We both walk away with half a million dollars. This is much more equitable than your initial offer, and if we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose value due to my 5% inflation penalty. Let's be reasonable and split it fairly.""}"
