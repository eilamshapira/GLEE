"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 51,
  ""bob_gain"": 49
}
```

This offer gives me a slight advantage, but is hopefully attractive enough for Bob to accept it and avoid further rounds and the risk of getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a fair offer. To avoid prolonged negotiation and the risk of getting nothing, I will accept.

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
