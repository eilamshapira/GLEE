"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering that time pressure affects me more than Bob (10% vs 5% loss per round). Since we both want to maximize our gains and avoid going into further rounds where the total value diminishes, I'll offer a slightly higher amount to Bob to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I propose this split because:
1. It's a reasonable division that gives Bob a slight advantage
2. If Bob rejects and we go to next round, the money will be worth less for both of us
3. It incentivizes Bob to accept now rather than risk a worse outcome in future rounds"
