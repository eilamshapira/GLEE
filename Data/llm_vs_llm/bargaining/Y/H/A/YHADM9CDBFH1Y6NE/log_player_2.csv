"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I receive $550,000 while she gets $450,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will decrease by 5% for me and 10% for Alice. This means the $1,000,000 will be worth $950,000 to me and $900,000 to Alice in the next round.

Given that I can make an offer next round and Alice has a higher discount rate (10% vs my 5%), I could potentially get a better deal. However, Alice's initial offer already gives me more than half of the money.

After careful consideration:
