"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer as it's highly unfavorable to me, only giving me 10% of the total amount. While there is 5% inflation per round, I can afford to make a counter-offer in the next round that would be more equitable. Since I'll be making the next proposal, I can suggest a more balanced distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money. This offer is reasonable and equitable for both parties, giving each of us $500,000. Given that there's inflation affecting my gains in future rounds, this is a sensible offer that Alice should consider accepting, as it treats both parties equally and avoids further devaluation of the total amount."
