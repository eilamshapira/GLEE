"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly! I'll take the lion's share, but you'll still get a good chunk. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $2000 for me, $8000 for Alice
2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less for me
   * It will be worth 10% less for Alice
   * I'll get to make the next offer

This is a very uneven split (80/20). If I reject, I can propose a better split next round, though my money will be worth less. Even with the 20% depreciation, I could potentially get more value by making a counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

Since Alice is experiencing less depreciation per round (10% vs my 20%), she might be more willing to wait. However, she's still losing value, so I should propose a reasonable split that she'd want to accept.

The initial 80/20 split was too unfair. I'll propose a more balanced 60/40 split, which is still advantageous to her but much more reasonable for me.
