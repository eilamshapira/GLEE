"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start off with a fair division. I believe this is a solid offer for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $200,000 out of $1,000,000 (20%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, inflation will reduce the value by 5% each round
4. If I reject, the $1M pool will be worth $950,000 next round
5. This first offer seems quite low - a fair split would be closer to 50/50

Given that I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer next round, and the inflation penalty isn't too severe for just one round, I'll reject this uneven split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while acknowledging the time pressure we both face:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both walk away with a significant amount, and we avoid losing value to inflation in future rounds.""}

This is a reasonable proposal because:
1. It's an equal split which is traditionally considered fair
2. It's a significant improvement for me compared to the previous offer
3. Alice still gets a substantial amount
4. The message emphasizes our mutual interest in avoiding inflation losses
5. It sets a cooperative tone while being firm about fairness"
