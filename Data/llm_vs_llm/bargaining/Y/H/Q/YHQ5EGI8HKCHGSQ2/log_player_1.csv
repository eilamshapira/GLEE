"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I'm playing as Alice, trying to maximize my gain while considering the inflation risk. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the new offer and the inflation impact. Let's analyze:

*   **My potential gain:** 550,000
*   **Inflation impact on my gain:** 5% less than the original value. So it is equal to 550000*(1-0.05) = 522500

Now, the critical question is whether the potential gain in this round (accounting for inflation) is better than the *expected* gain if I reject and make an offer in the next round, considering that the money will be worth even less. It's difficult to predict Bob's behavior, but I can assume he will offer me a smaller portion in the next round due to further inflation. I'll also have to give up some of the money!
522,500 is high enough to stop playing and accept the money!
