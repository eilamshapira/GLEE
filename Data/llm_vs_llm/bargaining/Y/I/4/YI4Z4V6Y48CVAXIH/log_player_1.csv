"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the $1,000,000.

Considering the 10% inflation penalty per round for me but not for Bob, I should aim for a fair division that accounts for this asymmetry.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing I receive $550,000 and Bob receives $450,000. This slightly favors me now, but if Bob rejects and we go to another round, the total value to me will decrease by 10%, making waiting costly for me. This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while acknowledging my time pressure."
