7000.0,3000.0,Let's start with a fair division. I get 70% and you get 30%.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
2710.0,7290.0,"Alice, if you wait until round 3 you’ll be in the proposer’s seat, but your optimal outcome there would be to secure about $2710 for yourself (after giving Bob just enough so he prefers accepting over waiting). To avoid further delay (and further discounting my share), I suggest we agree now on this division: you get $2710 and I get $7290. I believe this is fair given the circumstances—please accept.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,Let's be more reasonable this time. I propose 60% for me and 40% for you. This way we both get a decent share.,Alice,3,
,,"Alice, I'm afraid I must pass on this offer. Given the discounting on my side, I still have a better prospect by taking the proposer’s seat in the next round. Your 40% share for me today results in an effective value of about $3240 for me, which is less than what I stand to secure if I get to propose in Round 4. I hope you understand my position.",Bob,3,reject
3439.0,6561.0,"Alice, if you reject my proposal, you’ll become the proposer in Round 5 and can secure $3439 for yourself. Bearing in mind that every round further reduces the value of my potential gains by 10% (compounded, so in Round 4 my money is worth only 73% of its original value), this division is the best rational compromise available. I’m offering you $3439 undiscounted—which is exactly what you’d get if we continued—so please accept this offer and let’s resolve this today.",Bob,4,
