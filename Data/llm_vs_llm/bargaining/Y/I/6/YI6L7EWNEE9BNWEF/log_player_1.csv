"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if you wait until round 3 you’ll be in the proposer’s seat, but your optimal outcome there would be to secure about $2710 for yourself (after giving Bob just enough so he prefers accepting over waiting). To avoid further delay (and further discounting my share), I suggest we agree now on this division: you get $2710 and I get $7290. I believe this is fair given the circumstances—please accept. 
# Alice gain: 2710 
# Bob gain: 7290 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if you reject my proposal, you’ll become the proposer in Round 5 and can secure $3439 for yourself. Bearing in mind that every round further reduces the value of my potential gains by 10% (compounded, so in Round 4 my money is worth only 73% of its original value), this division is the best rational compromise available. I’m offering you $3439 undiscounted—which is exactly what you’d get if we continued—so please accept this offer and let’s resolve this today. 
# Alice gain: 3439 
# Bob gain: 6561
