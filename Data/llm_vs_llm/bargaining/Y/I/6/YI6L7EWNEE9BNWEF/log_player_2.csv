"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I get 70% and you get 30%. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7290, ""alice_gain"": 2710, ""message"": ""Alice, if you wait until round 3 you’ll be in the proposer’s seat, but your optimal outcome there would be to secure about $2710 for yourself (after giving Bob just enough so he prefers accepting over waiting). To avoid further delay (and further discounting my share), I suggest we agree now on this division: you get $2710 and I get $7290. I believe this is fair given the circumstances—please accept.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be more reasonable this time. I propose 60% for me and 40% for you. This way we both get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm afraid I must pass on this offer. Given the discounting on my side, I still have a better prospect by taking the proposer’s seat in the next round. Your 40% share for me today results in an effective value of about $3,240 for me, which is less than what I stand to secure if I get to propose in Round 4. I hope you understand my position.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6561, ""alice_gain"": 3439, ""message"": ""Alice, if you reject my proposal, you’ll become the proposer in Round 5 and can secure $3439 for yourself. Bearing in mind that every round further reduces the value of my potential gains by 10% (compounded, so in Round 4 my money is worth only 73% of its original value), this division is the best rational compromise available. I’m offering you $3439 undiscounted—which is exactly what you’d get if we continued—so please accept this offer and let’s resolve this today.""}"
