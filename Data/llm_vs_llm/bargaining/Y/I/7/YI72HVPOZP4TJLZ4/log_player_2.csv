"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer gives me $4000 out of the $10,000, which is less than half. Since Alice's money decreases in value by 10% each round (while mine doesn't decrease), I have some negotiating leverage. I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, considering that Alice faces a 10% inflation penalty per round while I don't.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a more equitable split where I get $5500 and Alice gets $4500. This is fair because if Alice rejects and we go to round 3, her share will be worth 10% less to her, so she has incentive to accept a reasonable offer now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me from $4000 to $4600, which shows some movement in my direction. However, I still believe I can get a better deal. Since Alice is facing increasing inflation penalties (now at 19%) while I face no inflation, I have strategic leverage. Her $5400 is actually worth less to her now than in the first round. I'll reject this offer to see if I can get a more favorable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer since Alice is now facing a 27.1% inflation penalty if we go to the next round.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I'm proposing I get $6000 and Alice gets $4000. This is reasonable considering the inflation Alice faces. If she rejects and we go to another round, her money will be worth even less to her, so accepting $4000 now is better than potentially getting less value later."
