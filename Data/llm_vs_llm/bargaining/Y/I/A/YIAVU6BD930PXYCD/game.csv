550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a reasonable 55-45 split in my favor. Since we both face inflation penalties but mine is higher (10% vs 5%), this split accounts for that difference while still being fair to both of us. Let's avoid lengthy negotiations that will reduce the money's value.",Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage, and we can both walk away with a decent amount. A prolonged negotiation will only reduce our gains due to inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, let's be practical. Due to the different inflation rates (10% for me, 5% for you), an equal nominal split actually favors you. This 52.5-47.5 split better reflects our different inflation rates while still being quite fair. Further delays will hurt us both - let's conclude this now.",Alice,3,

475000.0,525000.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, your proposal still favors you more. Let's meet in the middle with this split. This way, we both get a fair share, and we can avoid further devaluation due to inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
515000.0,485000.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. I've reduced my requested share to 51.5%. Given that my inflation rate (10%) is double yours (5%), this split is actually very fair in real terms. We're already losing significant value - I've lost 27.1% and you've lost 14.26%. Let's not waste more rounds.",Alice,5,
