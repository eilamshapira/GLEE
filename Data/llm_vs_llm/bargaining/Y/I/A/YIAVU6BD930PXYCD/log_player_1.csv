"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Let me make a fair initial offer while considering the inflation pressure on both of us.

{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a reasonable 55-45 split in my favor. Since we both face inflation penalties but mine is higher (10% vs 5%), this split accounts for that difference while still being fair to both of us. Let's avoid lengthy negotiations that will reduce the money's value.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage, and we can both walk away with a decent amount. A prolonged negotiation will only reduce our gains due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The equal split doesn't account for the asymmetric inflation rates we face. Since my inflation rate (10%) is higher than Bob's (5%), I need a higher nominal amount to achieve fair effective value. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that better reflects this reality."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. Due to the different inflation rates (10% for me, 5% for you), an equal nominal split actually favors you. This 52.5-47.5 split better reflects our different inflation rates while still being quite fair. Further delays will hurt us both - let's conclude this now.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, your proposal still favors you more. Let's meet in the middle with this split. This way, we both get a fair share, and we can avoid further devaluation due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer now favors him more than me, and with my higher inflation rate (10% vs 5%), this disparity becomes even more significant. The difference in our inflation rates means I need a higher nominal amount to achieve fair effective value. I'll make a more balanced counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
""alice_gain"": 515000,
""bob_gain"": 485000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable. I've reduced my requested share to 51.5%. Given that my inflation rate (10%) is double yours (5%), this split is actually very fair in real terms. We're already losing significant value - I've lost 27.1% and you've lost 14.26%. Let's not waste more rounds.""
