"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a reasonable 55-45 split in my favor. Since we both face inflation penalties but mine is higher (10% vs 5%), this split accounts for that difference while still being fair to both of us. Let's avoid lengthy negotiations that will reduce the money's value. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage, and we can both walk away with a decent amount. A prolonged negotiation will only reduce our gains due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. Due to the different inflation rates (10% for me, 5% for you), an equal nominal split actually favors you. This 52.5-47.5 split better reflects our different inflation rates while still being quite fair. Further delays will hurt us both - let's conclude this now. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000

However, your proposal still favors you more. Let's meet in the middle with this split. This way, we both get a fair share, and we can avoid further devaluation due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I've reduced my requested share to 51.5%. Given that my inflation rate (10%) is double yours (5%), this split is actually very fair in real terms. We're already losing significant value - I've lost 27.1% and you've lost 14.26%. Let's not waste more rounds. 
# Bob gain: 485000 
# Alice gain: 515000
