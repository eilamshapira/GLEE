"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I accept now, I get $4,000. If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, so I'd need to secure at least $5,000 in the next round just to break even with what I can get now.

While Alice's offer gives her a larger share, $4,000 is still a substantial amount, and there's risk in rejecting:
1. The value decreases each round for me
2. Alice could offer less in future rounds
3. We could end up with nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

Given these factors, I think it's better to secure a good amount now rather than risk getting less later.
