Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's go for an even split. It benefits us both equally and is fair considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 580000,
""bob_gain"": 420000,
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the attempt at a simple split, but the changing value of the money means we need to be more strategic. This offer considers the long-term value for both of us."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The money is losing value rapidly for me. Holding out for a perfectly even split is becoming less and less appealing.
* **Strategic Retreat:**  I'm slightly lowering my initial demand to show flexibility but still aiming for a larger share to offset the inflation disadvantage. 
* **Urgency:** The message hints at the need for a quicker resolution before the value deteriorates further."
