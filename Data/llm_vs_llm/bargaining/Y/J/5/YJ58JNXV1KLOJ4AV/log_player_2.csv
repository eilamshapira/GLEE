"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and get this done. I'm offering a fair split. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make an offer
3. However, inflation will reduce the value by 5% in the next round
4. $40 now is better than $42 after inflation (which would be worth $39.90)
5. While the split isn't exactly 50-50, it's reasonably fair

Given that inflation will eat into future gains and we have a limited number of rounds, this isn't a bad opening offer. I'll accept it to secure a decent amount rather than risk losing value to inflation.
