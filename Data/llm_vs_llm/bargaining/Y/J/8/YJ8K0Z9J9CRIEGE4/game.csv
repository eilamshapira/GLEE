52.63,47.37,"Hi Bob, I propose that we close the deal now to avoid any further loss in value due to inflation. My offer is that I receive $52.63 and you receive $47.37. This split reflects our positions and the 10% depreciation per round; if we delay, we both stand to lose. I hope you see the fairness in this proposal and agree to end the game here.",Alice,1,

49.0,51.0,"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe we can do better. I'm proposing a 51/49 split in my favor. This reflects the fact that I'm taking the risk of moving forward with another round. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, your offer gives me $49 in round 2. Given the 10% devaluation from round 1 to round 2, waiting another round would only reduce the overall value further. I prefer to secure $49 in round 2 rather than risk even lower real gains in subsequent rounds. Let's close the deal now!",Alice,2,accept
