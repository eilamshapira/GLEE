"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52.63, ""bob_gain"": 47.37, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that we close the deal now to avoid any further loss in value due to inflation. My offer is that I receive $52.63 and you receive $47.37. This split reflects our positions and the 10% depreciation per round; if we delay, we both stand to lose. I hope you see the fairness in this proposal and agree to end the game here.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe we can do better. I'm proposing a 51/49 split in my favor. This reflects the fact that I'm taking the risk of moving forward with another round. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, your offer gives me $49 in round 2. Given the 10% devaluation from round 1 to round 2, waiting another round would only reduce the overall value further. I prefer to secure $49 in round 2 rather than risk even lower real gains in subsequent rounds. Let's close the deal now!""}"
