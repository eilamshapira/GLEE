"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that we close the deal now to avoid any further loss in value due to inflation. My offer is that I receive $52.63 and you receive $47.37. This split reflects our positions and the 10% depreciation per round; if we delay, we both stand to lose. I hope you see the fairness in this proposal and agree to end the game here. 
# Bob gain: 47.37 
# Alice gain: 52.63 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
