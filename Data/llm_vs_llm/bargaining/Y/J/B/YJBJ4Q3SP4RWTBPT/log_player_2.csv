Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Before making my offer, I want to strategize. Alice seems to be asking for a larger share, but with each round, the value of the money decreases more for her than for me. I should consider this in my offer.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

This offer gives me a larger share but still provides Alice with a substantial amount, considering the inflation impact on her."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is still asking for a larger share, but with each round, the value of the money decreases more significantly for her. I should hold out for a better offer in the next rounds, as the impact of inflation on Alice's share becomes more pronounced."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

This offer gives me an even larger share, but still provides Alice with a reasonable amount, considering the inflation impact on her. As rounds progress, Alice's share will be worth significantly less due to the higher inflation rate she faces."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is still not favorable to me, and with each round, the value of the money decreases more significantly for her. I should continue to hold out for a better offer in the next rounds. With only a few rounds left, the pressure on Alice to accept a more even split increases."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}

Given that the value of the money is decreasing more rapidly for Alice, I can offer her a smaller share while still considering that the actual value she receives is even less due to inflation. With only a few rounds left, Alice might be more inclined to accept this offer to secure some value before it diminishes further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

With only a few rounds left and the value of the money decreasing rapidly, it's better to secure an equal share now. Further rounds might not yield a better offer, and there's a risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement."
