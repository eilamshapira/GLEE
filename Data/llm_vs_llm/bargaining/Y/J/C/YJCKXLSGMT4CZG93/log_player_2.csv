"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with me getting 5500 and you getting 4500. This is a fair split considering the inflation risk for me. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing that she gets $5,500 and I get $4,500. If I reject, we go to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the total money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject and we move to round 2, the $10,000 would effectively be worth $8,000 to me due to the 20% inflation. That means even if I managed to get a larger percentage in the next round, the actual value might be less than the $4,500 I'm offered now.

Given that I don't know how inflation affects Alice, and considering that the current offer gives me a substantial amount rather than risking greater devaluation, I'll accept this offer.
