"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer to divide the $100 with Bob.

Given the inflation rates (5% for me, 20% for Bob), I should consider that Bob has a stronger incentive to accept earlier rather than delay.

{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives Bob a reasonable share while acknowledging that waiting would be more costly for him due to his higher inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more balanced offer considering our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a 55-45 split. Since we're now in round 3, both of us are facing increasing inflation penalties. For Bob, the 20% inflation per round makes delaying very costly, so this improved offer gives him a larger share while still recognizing my advantage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I notice we're getting closer in our offers, but we're now in round 5 and Bob's inflation penalty is becoming quite severe at nearly 50% less value already.

{""alice_gain"": 52, 
""bob_gain"": 48}

I propose a 52-48 split. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the mounting inflation pressures on both of us, especially Bob. At this point, delaying further would significantly hurt Bob's potential gains, so this improved offer gives him a larger share while still maintaining a slight advantage for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52
