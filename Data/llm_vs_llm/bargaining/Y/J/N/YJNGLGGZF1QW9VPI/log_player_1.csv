"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 1000000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the entire $1,000,000 right now. Given that any delay only devalues my share by 5% per round while your share remains full, I know you'll be able to secure the full amount by waiting. To keep things efficient and avoid needless discounting on my side, please accept this offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. I appreciate the opening gambit, but we both know that's not a sustainable deal. I'm proposing a strong majority for me to reflect the risk I'm taking by letting the clock run. This offer gets us both something. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and while the split may seem lopsided, the timing discount on my side makes this deal the best option for me right now. Let's finalize the agreement.""}"
