"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the entire $1000000 right now. Given that any delay only devalues my share by 5% per round while your share remains full, I know you'll be able to secure the full amount by waiting. To keep things efficient and avoid needless discounting on my side, please accept this offer. 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer seems generous on the surface, it leaves me with all the risk.  It's highly unlikely she'd be willing to accept $0 after multiple rounds. I need to signal I'm serious about getting a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 950000,
""alice_gain"": 50000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I appreciate the opening gambit, but we both know that's not a sustainable deal. I'm proposing a strong majority for me to reflect the risk I'm taking by letting the clock run. This offer gets us both something.""}"
