"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer gives me $4,000 while she would get $6,000. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but inflation will reduce the value of money by 5% for me.

If I reject, the total $10,000 would be worth only $9,500 to me in the next round. Even if I proposed taking the entire amount, the maximum I could get would be $9,500 in present value, and Alice would likely reject such an unfair offer anyway.

$4,000 now is better than potentially getting a bit more in future rounds but losing value to inflation. The offer isn't perfectly fair, but it's reasonable enough considering the inflation penalty.
