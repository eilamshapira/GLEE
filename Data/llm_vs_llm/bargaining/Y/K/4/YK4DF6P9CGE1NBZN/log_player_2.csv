"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. It's a fair deal that gives us both a good share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing a 60/40 split in her favor, giving me $40. However, I need to account for the 20% inflation that will affect my gain in each round. If I reject and make a counter-offer, we'll move to round 2 where any money I receive would be worth 20% less to me.

Current offer value to me: $40
If I reject and get $50 next round: $50 Ã— 0.8 = $40

Even if I could negotiate for more in the next round, the inflation would reduce its value. The 40/60 split isn't perfectly even, but it's reasonable given the inflation pressure I'm facing.
