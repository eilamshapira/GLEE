50.0,50.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair 50/50 split. Since my inflation rate (20%) is higher than yours (10%), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, your 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, but with the inflation we're facing, it's not really equal. I need to take a bit more to offset my losses over time. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but I actually face higher inflation than you do (20% vs 10%). This means I lose more value with each passing round. A 55/45 split in my favor helps balance this disadvantage while still giving you a substantial portion.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"Alice, I acknowledge that your inflation rate is higher, and I'm willing to adjust my initial proposal.  How about a 58/42 split?  It bridges the gap between our positions and provides a more equitable outcome given the circumstances.",Bob,4,

52.0,48.0,"Bob, we're now halfway through our rounds, and inflation is seriously eroding both our potentials. I'm moving closer to your position with a 52/48 split. This is a fair compromise considering our different inflation rates. Let's reach an agreement now before further rounds diminish what we both get.",Alice,5,
