"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair initial offer to Bob, considering the different inflation rates we both face.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair 50/50 split. Since my inflation rate (20%) is higher than yours (10%), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, but with the inflation we're facing, it's not really equal. I need to take a bit more to offset my losses over time. How about a 60/40 split in my favor? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but I actually face higher inflation than you do (20% vs 10%). This means I lose more value with each passing round. A 55/45 split in my favor helps balance this disadvantage while still giving you a substantial portion.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I acknowledge that your inflation rate is higher, and I'm willing to adjust my initial proposal.  How about a 58/42 split?  It bridges the gap between our positions and provides a more equitable outcome given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Bob, we're now halfway through our rounds, and inflation is seriously eroding both our potentials. I'm moving closer to your position with a 52/48 split. This is a fair compromise considering our different inflation rates. Let's reach an agreement now before further rounds diminish what we both get.""
