"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair 50/50 split. Since my inflation rate (20%) is higher than yours (10%), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, your 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, but with the inflation we're facing, it's not really equal. I need to take a bit more to offset my losses over time. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but I actually face higher inflation than you do (20% vs 10%). This means I lose more value with each passing round. A 55/45 split in my favor helps balance this disadvantage while still giving you a substantial portion. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
 
Alice is correct that her losses are greater than mine each round, but I'm still not convinced a 55/45 split is fair. I'll try to bring her closer to a more agreeable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 58,
""alice_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""Alice, I acknowledge that your inflation rate is higher, and I'm willing to adjust my initial proposal.  How about a 58/42 split?  It bridges the gap between our positions and provides a more equitable outcome given the circumstances."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're now halfway through our rounds, and inflation is seriously eroding both our potentials. I'm moving closer to your position with a 52/48 split. This is a fair compromise considering our different inflation rates. Let's reach an agreement now before further rounds diminish what we both get. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

While I think I could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher share in the next round or two, Alice is right about the impact of inflation.  Accepting this offer now guarantees a reasonable amount, and it's better to secure that than risk getting nothing if we fail to agree."
