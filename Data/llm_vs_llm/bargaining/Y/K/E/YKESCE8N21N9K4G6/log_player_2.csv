"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, keeping $60 for herself. However, with inflation, each passing round reduces the value of my money by 20%.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the $100 would only be worth $80 to me (due to 20% inflation), so a perfect split would be $50 for me (worth $40 after inflation) and $50 for Alice.

Given that inflation only affects me, delaying doesn't work in my favor. If we go several rounds, the total value keeps decreasing for me but not for Alice. The offered $40 now is better than potentially getting something worth less later.
