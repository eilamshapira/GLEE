"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 38.52 
# Alice gain: 61.48 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $38.52, Alice gets $61.48
2. If I reject and we go to next round:
   - Money is worth 20% less for me
   - Money is worth 10% less for Alice
   - But I get to make the next offer

While $38.52 is less than half, waiting would mean the total value decreases significantly for both of us. Also, this isn't a terrible first offer - I get more than a third of the total.

However, since the devaluation is higher for me than for Alice (20% vs 10%), I should try to get a better deal early. I can make a counter-offer in the next round where the total pot is still worth more.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I should propose something that's better for me while still being reasonable enough for Alice to accept. Given that:

1. Alice proposed a 38.52/61.48 split initially, showing some willingness to negotiate
2. The money devalues faster for me (20%) than for Alice (10%)
3. We both lose everything if we don't agree within 12 rounds
4. Alice will be more likely to accept if she still gets a decent portion

I'll propose a split that's more in my favor but not extremely aggressive:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose a 55/45 split, which gives me a majority but still leaves Alice with a significant portion. This is better than my alternative of waiting another round where my money would be worth 20% less."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42.45 
# Alice gain: 57.55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Current offer: I get $42.45, but it's worth 36% less than round 1, so effectively about $27.17
2. If I reject:
   - Next round money will be worth 48.8% less for me (1 - 0.8^4)
   - I get to make the offer again
   - But Alice's devaluation is slower, strengthening her position

Alice has increased her offer to me (from 38.52 to 42.45), showing willingness to negotiate. Given that:
- The money is devaluing much faster for me than for Alice
- We're already in round 3
- Alice has shown movement in my direction
- Further delays significantly hurt my position more than hers
- This is better than her first offer

I should accept this offer before the money devalues further.
