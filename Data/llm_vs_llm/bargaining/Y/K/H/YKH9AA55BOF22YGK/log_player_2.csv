"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, 50-50. It's fair and we both benefit equally. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer. Alice is proposing a perfectly even split of $50 for each of us. This is a fair division that gives us equal gains. While I could reject and counter-offer to try getting more for myself, an even split is objectively fair, and accepting now guarantees me $50 rather than risking potential complications in further rounds.
