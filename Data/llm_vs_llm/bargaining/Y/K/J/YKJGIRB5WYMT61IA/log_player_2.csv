"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll carefully consider Alice's proposal in Round 1. She's offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40% of the total amount, while she takes $600,000 (60%).

I need to factor in the 5% inflation penalty per round. If I reject now, I'll make a counteroffer in Round 2, but any amount would be worth 5% less to me. If we went all the way to Round 12, the money would be significantly devalued for me.

While Alice's offer gives her more than me, $400,000 is still substantial, and accepting now avoids any inflation penalty. Making a better deal later might not compensate for the inflation loss.
