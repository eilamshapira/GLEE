"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair start. Let's get this done quickly! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
* She's offering me $40 out of $100
* If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
* However, there will be 5% inflation, so the total value will be $95
* While 40/60 isn't completely equal, it's a reasonable starting offer
* Getting it done quickly does have value due to inflation

However, I think I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round, even with the inflation penalty.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering the 5% inflation that has already occurred (total value now $95):

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it equally. This way we both benefit the same amount, and we can finish before more value is lost to inflation.""}"
