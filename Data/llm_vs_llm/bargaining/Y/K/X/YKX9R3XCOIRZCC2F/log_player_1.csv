"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the 5% depreciation per round that affects my gains. Since Bob doesn't face depreciation, he might be more patient, but I'll try to make a compelling first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this split because it's favorable enough to me while still giving Bob a substantial portion that he might accept rather than risk further negotiations. If we go to the next round, my potential gains would be worth 5% less, so I'm motivated to reach an agreement quickly."
