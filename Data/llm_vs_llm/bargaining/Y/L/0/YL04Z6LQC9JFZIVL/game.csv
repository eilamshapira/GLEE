600000.0,400000.0,Let's split it fairly to start! This is a good deal for both of us.,Alice,1,

1.0,999999.0,"Alice, every round you wait further reduces the real value of your share. In round 3 you would have to offer almost everything to Bob just to get you to agree, leaving you nearly nothing. For your benefit, I’m offering you a minimal share now—it's more than you'll get by waiting. Please accept.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
10000.0,990000.0,"I understand the situation. Take this deal, it's better than what you'll get if we keep going, as the value of my share continues to diminish.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
1.0,999999.0,"Alice, every minute counts. In round 4, your dollars are worth only about 51.2% of their original value. If you reject, you'll be forced into a situation where your bargaining power dwindles even further—leaving you almost nothing. I’m offering you a token amount now, which, while tiny, beats the alternative. Accept this deal.",Bob,4,

500.0,999500.0,This is the last offer. Take it or you get nothing. The value of the money I receive is tiny at this point. Let's end this.,Alice,5,
