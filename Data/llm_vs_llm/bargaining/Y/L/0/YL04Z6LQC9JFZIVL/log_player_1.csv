Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round you wait further reduces the real value of your share. In round 3 you would have to offer almost everything to Bob just to get you to agree, leaving you nearly nothing. For your benefit, I’m offering you a minimal share now—it's more than you'll get by waiting. Please accept.

# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every minute counts. In round 4, your dollars are worth only about 51.2% of their original value. If you reject, you'll be forced into a situation where your bargaining power dwindles even further—leaving you almost nothing. I’m offering you a token amount now, which, while tiny, beats the alternative. Accept this deal.
