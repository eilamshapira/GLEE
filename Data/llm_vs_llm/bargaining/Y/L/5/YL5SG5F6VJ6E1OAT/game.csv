4500.0,5500.0,"Given the 10% depreciation you face vs my 5%, this split is actually better for you than your previous offer would be after depreciation. Let's be fair and avoid further losses.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"My offer remains. Given depreciation, this is more fair to you than my initial offer. Accept now or lose even more.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Let's be practical. Due to severe depreciation (29% for you, 15% for me), this split gives us both more value than continuing. Your 4200$ now is worth more than 6500$ at 29% depreciation (4615$). Let's end this efficiently.",Bob,4,
