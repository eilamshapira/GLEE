"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alice offers a 60/40 split. Accept this fair offer or we both lose money next round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me 4000$ while taking 6000$ for herself
2. If I reject:
   * Money will be worth 5% less for me next round (I'll only have 9500$ worth to split)
   * It will be worth 10% less for Alice
   * I'll get to make the next proposal

Given that:
- The depreciation is worse for Alice (10% vs my 5%)
- The current split is notably in Alice's favor (60/40)
- I'll have the power to make the next proposal
- Even with 5% depreciation, I could still propose a better split for myself

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Given the 10% depreciation you face vs my 5%, this split is actually better for you than your previous offer would be after depreciation. Let's be fair and avoid further losses.""}

Reasoning:
1. For Alice, $4500 now is better than $6000 worth 10% less ($5400)
2. For me, $5500 now is better than $4000 worth 5% less ($3800)
3. The split is more equitable than the initial 60/40
4. I emphasize the mutual benefit of accepting now due to depreciation
5. The message tone is cooperative while highlighting the economic logic"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: My offer remains. Given depreciation, this is more fair to you than my initial offer. Accept now or lose even more. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is now offering me even less than before (3500$ vs initial 4000$)
2. Due to depreciation:
   * My 3500$ is worth only 3161.25$ (9.75% less)
   * Alice's 6500$ is worth only 5265$ (19% less)
3. If I reject:
   * Next round money will be worth about 15% less for me
   * And about 29% less for Alice
   * I get to make the proposal

This is actually a worse offer than the first one, and Alice seems to be playing aggressively rather than cooperatively. Given the steep depreciation Alice faces (19% vs my 9.75%), I can make a better offer next round that would still be more attractive to both of us.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800,
""alice_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Let's be practical. Due to severe depreciation (29% for you, 15% for me), this split gives us both more value than continuing. Your 4200$ now is worth more than 6500$ at 29% depreciation (4615$). Let's end this efficiently.""}

Reasoning:
1. Alice's aggressive strategy is actually hurting her more due to higher depreciation rate
2. For Alice: $4200 now > $6500 at 29% depreciation ($4615)
3. For me: $5800 now > $3500 at 15% depreciation ($2975)
4. The message focuses on the mathematical reality of depreciation
5. I'm taking a slightly harder stance than my previous offer because Alice's last move was more aggressive
6. This offer still leaves both of us better off than continuing the game"
