"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob â€” I know that every extra round hurts my share by 5%, while yours remains undiminished. To avoid any delays and secure a sure outcome for both of us, I'm offering you the full $100 today. Please accept this offer, and let's conclude the game now. 
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is correct that her position weakens by 5% each round due to inflation
2. My position remains strong as I don't face inflation penalties
3. This offer gives me the maximum possible amount ($100)
4. Even if I reject, I cannot possibly get more than $100 in future rounds
5. There's no strategic advantage in rejecting this offer

Given these factors, it's clearly optimal to accept this offer. I get the maximum possible payout, and there's no way to improve my position by continuing.
