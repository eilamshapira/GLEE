Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. We both get a decent amount, and we don't risk losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Taking the deal at this point is the safest option. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round. Holding out for a better deal is becoming increasingly risky. 
* **Bob's Pattern:** Bob seems to be aiming for a more favorable split for himself, but his offer is getting closer to even. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting guarantees a relatively decent share, whereas rejecting risks getting nothing if we can't agree in the remaining rounds."
