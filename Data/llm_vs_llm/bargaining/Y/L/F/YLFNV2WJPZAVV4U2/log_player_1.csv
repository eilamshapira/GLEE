"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my offer to divide $1,000,000 in this first round. Since I'm playing as Alice and I know that with each passing round the money will be worth 20% less for me due to inflation, I should make a reasonable first offer that Bob might accept.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a slightly higher portion for myself but still giving Bob a substantial amount. This seems fair given that if Bob rejects, he'll have to make a counter-offer, and I'll have the power to accept or reject in the next round."
