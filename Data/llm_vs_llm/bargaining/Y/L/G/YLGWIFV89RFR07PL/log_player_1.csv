"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll divide the $10,000 with Bob in a way that accounts for the 20% inflation penalty for delaying.

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This gives us both $5,000 which is the most equitable division. If we delay, we both lose money due to the 20% inflation penalty per round, so it's in our mutual interest to agree now.""}"
