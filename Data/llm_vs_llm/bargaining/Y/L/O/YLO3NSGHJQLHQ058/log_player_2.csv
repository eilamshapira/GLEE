"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 
Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, which means I'd get 40% of the total.

While this isn't a terrible offer, I think I can negotiate for a better split since:
1. I have many rounds left to negotiate
2. There's no inflation penalty for me
3. I can make the next offer if I reject

I'll reject this and propose a more balanced split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still slightly in my favor since I know I'm not affected by inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose this split considering that:
1. It's more balanced than Alice's initial offer
2. I'm offering Alice a reasonable amount that's harder to reject
3. If Alice rejects, they'll need to consider the potential inflation effect on their side"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased their offer to me from $40 to $45 compared to round 1
2. I now know that Alice is experiencing 19% inflation on their gains
3. For Alice, their $55 is actually worth only $44.55 (55 * 0.81) due to inflation
4. My $45 still maintains full value since I'm not affected by inflation
5. Given the inflation effect on Alice's side, this offer actually gives me the better end of the deal in real value

This is a reasonable offer considering these factors. If I reject, Alice's inflation will increase further, but they might become more aggressive in negotiations.
