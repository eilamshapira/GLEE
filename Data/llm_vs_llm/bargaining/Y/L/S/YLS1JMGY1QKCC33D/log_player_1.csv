"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 440000, ""bob_gain"": 560000} 

Let me explain briefly my reasoning. In our 12‐round alternating‐offer game the “pie” stays fixed at $1,000,000 in nominal terms, but its real value falls with every round—10% per round for you (Alice) and 20% per round for Bob. In a backward–induction analysis of such discounted bargaining problems the proposer in early rounds can “leverage” the fact that waiting penalizes the responder (here Bob’s money loses value faster). In other words, although if you reject my offer Bob will get to propose next round, his money will be worth only 80% of the nominal offer compared to full value now. Working “backwards” (from round 12 in which the proposer can claim nearly the entire pie) one finds that Bob’s reservation utility in round 1 turns out to be roughly equivalent to receiving about $560,000 immediately. 

With that in mind, I’m offering you (Bob) a current share of $560,000—which is at least as good as your “wait‐and‐see” value—while I keep $440,000. 

What do you say?"
