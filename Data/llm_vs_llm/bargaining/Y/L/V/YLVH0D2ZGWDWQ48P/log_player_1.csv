"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1, formatted as JSON:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the situation. I need to calculate the value of the money to me after inflation.

*   **Original Offer (Round 1):** I would have received $900,000.
*   **Inflation:** My money is now worth 20% less.

So, my $500,000 in this round is now worth:

$500,000 \* (1 - 0.20) = $400,000

However, the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer is:

*   **Alice gain: $500,000**
*   **Bob gain: $500,000**

Since $400,000 is still more valuable than 0, I will accept.
