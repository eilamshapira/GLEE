55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in our favor. This is fair because inflation affects me more (20% per round) than you (10% per round), so I need a slightly higher amount now to make this equitable. Let's agree and both walk away with a good outcome rather than letting inflation diminish our gains.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, your rate of inflation is indeed a factor, but your initial offer doesn't reflect a sense of urgency given how quickly the value diminishes. Let's be pragmatic: 60/40 ensures I'm covered for future rounds while still giving you a decent amount upfront.",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, I understand your perspective, but let's be fair. I'm proposing an even 50/50 split. This is actually more favorable to you considering our inflation rates - your 50 at 10% inflation is worth more than my 50 at 20% inflation. If we continue negotiating, we both lose significant value. Let's agree on this balanced split and both walk away with a fair amount before inflation diminishes our gains further.",Alice,3,
