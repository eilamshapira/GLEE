"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a fair division to Bob, considering our different inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in our favor. This is fair because inflation affects me more (20% per round) than you (10% per round), so I need a slightly higher amount now to make this equitable. Let's agree and both walk away with a good outcome rather than letting inflation diminish our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your rate of inflation is indeed a factor, but your initial offer doesn't reflect a sense of urgency given how quickly the value diminishes. Let's be pragmatic: 60/40 ensures I'm covered for future rounds while still giving you a decent amount upfront. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but let's be fair. I'm proposing an even 50/50 split. This is actually more favorable to you considering our inflation rates - your 50 at 10% inflation is worth more than my 50 at 20% inflation. If we continue negotiating, we both lose significant value. Let's agree on this balanced split and both walk away with a fair amount before inflation diminishes our gains further.""}"
