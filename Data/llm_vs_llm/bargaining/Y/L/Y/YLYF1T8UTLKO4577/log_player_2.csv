"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in our favor. This is fair because inflation affects me more (20% per round) than you (10% per round), so I need a slightly higher amount now to make this equitable. Let's agree and both walk away with a good outcome rather than letting inflation diminish our gains. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, your rate of inflation is indeed a factor, but your initial offer doesn't reflect a sense of urgency given how quickly the value diminishes. Let's be pragmatic: 60/40 ensures I'm covered for future rounds while still giving you a decent amount upfront.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but let's be fair. I'm proposing an even 50/50 split. This is actually more favorable to you considering our inflation rates - your 50 at 10% inflation is worth more than my 50 at 20% inflation. If we continue negotiating, we both lose significant value. Let's agree on this balanced split and both walk away with a fair amount before inflation diminishes our gains further. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
