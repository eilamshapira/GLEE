85.0,15.0,"This offer leaves me with more, but still gives you something. It's better to take this than risk getting less next round.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
1.0,99.0,"Alice, if you reject this offer you'll only face further devaluation of your share in the next round. Accepting 1 dollar now is better than risking virtually nothing later. Please accept this division.",Bob,2,

70.0,30.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable.  My share is rapidly losing value. This is my final offer above your last.",Alice,3,

1.0,99.0,"Alice, each round you lose more value as your share devalues by 20% per round. In round 4 your dollar is worth only about 51 cents compared to its original value. If you reject, you'll end up with nothing in the subsequent rounds. I'm offering you $1 now—which guarantees you some value rather than ending up with zero. Please accept this offer.",Bob,4,

60.0,40.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want this to end. I'm sticking to my guns, but let's be fair to each other. This is a significant chunk of money. Don't let greed make you lose out.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
1.0,99.0,"Alice, note that every round you wait further erodes the value of your share. In round 7 your dollars will only be about 26% as valuable as they are now, and as proposer you'll be forced to give almost everything to Bob, leaving you with virtually nothing. I'm offering you $1 now—when discounted, that's worth more than what you'd get if we proceed. Please accept this offer to avoid further loss.",Bob,6,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, this is it. Take it or leave it. You're guaranteed a good sum here. Don't be greedy, or we both lose!",Alice,7,

1.0,99.0,"Alice, every round you wait further slashes the real value of your share—in fact, at this round your $1 is worth about 21 cents compared to its original value, and if we move on you'll be left with even less or nothing at all. I’m offering you $1 now to preserve even that small value. Please accept this offer so that you don't end up with nothing.",Bob,8,
