"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, if you reject this offer you'll only face further devaluation of your share in the next round. Accepting 1 dollar now is better than risking virtually nothing later. Please accept this division. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable.  My share is rapidly losing value. This is my final offer above your last.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, each round you lose more value as your share devalues by 20% per round. In round 4 your dollar is worth only about 51 cents compared to its original value. If you reject, you'll end up with nothing in the subsequent rounds. I'm offering you $1 now—which guarantees you some value rather than ending up with zero. Please accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Bob is right about the devaluation, I'm banking on him being more risk-averse than me.  He wants the $99, and I believe he'll be willing to concede more as the game goes on to avoid risking getting nothing at all."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, note that every round you wait further erodes the value of your share. In round 7 your dollars will only be about 26% as valuable as they are now, and as proposer you'll be forced to give almost everything to Bob, leaving you with virtually nothing. I'm offering you $1 now—when discounted, that's worth more than what you'd get if we proceed. Please accept this offer to avoid further loss. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough one, and Bob isn't wrong about the math. However, I'm betting he's getting nervous now. He knows if he doesn't get my agreement soon, he risks getting nothing at all. I need to hold my nerve."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round you wait further slashes the real value of your share—in fact, at this round your $1 is worth about 21 cents compared to its original value, and if we move on you'll be left with even less or nothing at all. I’m offering you $1 now to preserve even that small value. Please accept this offer so that you don't end up with nothing. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's painful, but I have to accept.  The devaluation is too severe now.  If I reject this and make another offer, Bob will likely reject it, leaving me with even less in round 9.  It's a bitter pill to swallow, but better a small share than nothing at all."
