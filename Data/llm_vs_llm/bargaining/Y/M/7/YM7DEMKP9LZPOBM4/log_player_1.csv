"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","For the first round, I'll make a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I want to make a deal quickly. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This offer gives me a slight advantage, but it's still a fair split, considering the inflation penalty. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation penalty, the $4000 I'd gain is actually worth $4000 * 0.8 = $3200 to me.

Considering this, Bob's offer doesn't seem very favorable to me. I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 wasn't satisfactory, it's my turn again to make a proposal. Considering the inflation penalty, the total amount of $10,000 is now worth:

* To me: $10,000 * (0.8)^2 = $10,000 * 0.64 = $6,400
* To Bob: $10,000 * (0.9)^2 = $10,000 * 0.81 = $8,100

I'll make a more generous offer to Bob this time, hoping he'll accept:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800}

This way, I'm giving Bob a larger share, but still trying to get a decent amount for myself, considering the inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation penalty, the $3500 I'd gain is actually worth $3500 * (0.8)^3 = $3500 * 0.512 = $1792 to me.

Considering this, Bob's offer seems even less favorable to me than before. I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer in Round 4 wasn't satisfactory, it's my turn again to make a proposal. Considering the inflation penalty, the total amount of $10,000 is now worth:

* To me: $10,000 * (0.8)^4 = $10,000 * 0.4096 = $4,096
* To Bob: $10,000 * (0.9)^4 = $10,000 * 0.6561 = $6,561

I'll make a more generous offer to Bob this time, hoping he'll accept:

{""alice_gain"": 3000, ""bob_gain"": 7000}

This way, I'm giving Bob an even larger share, but still trying to get something for myself, considering the significant inflation penalty I'm facing."
