Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's slightly in Bob's favor, it's still a reasonable split and better than risking further rounds where we might both end up with less due to continued negotiations."
