"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losing any value to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm taking a risk by passing on a sure thing. This offer ensures I benefit from taking that risk. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 5% inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, my $40 will be worth $40 * 0.95 = $38.

Since Bob's offer is not very favorable to me, I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Due to the 5% inflation, the money I gain is now worth 10% less than the original value (5% less in Round 1 and another 5% less in Round 2). To calculate the effective value, I'll consider this when making my offer.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 45, 
""bob_gain"": 55, 
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share considering the inflation.""}"
