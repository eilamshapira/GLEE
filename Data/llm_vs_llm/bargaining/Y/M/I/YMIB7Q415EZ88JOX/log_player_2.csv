"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that I'm facing 20% inflation per round, I should carefully consider this offer. If I reject, the total value decreases for me, but I can make a counter-offer in the next round.

Alice's offer gives me $30, which is less than half but still substantial. If I reject and propose in round 2, I'd be dividing $80 in effective value (due to 20% inflation). Even if I got a larger percentage in round 2, the absolute value might not be much better than $30 now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to make a reasonable offer considering the inflation effect on my side. Since I've already lost 20% of the value due to inflation, I should propose a division that's favorable enough to me but also acceptable to Alice to prevent further rounds of inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing a split where I get $55 and Alice gets $45. This is a fair offer that gives me slightly more than half to account for some of my inflation loss, while still providing Alice with a substantial amount. I hope Alice will accept this offer so we can conclude the negotiation without further devaluation of the money."
