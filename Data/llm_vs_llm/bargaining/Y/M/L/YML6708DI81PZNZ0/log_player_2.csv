"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000 (40%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, the money will be worth 5% less next round
4. $1,000,000 will become $950,000 in round 2
5. Even though I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk of losing value through inflation

While I could try to negotiate for a more even split, 40% of the full amount is still a substantial sum, and the risk of losing value through inflation makes this a reasonable offer. However, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in round 2.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still slightly in my favor since Alice made the first aggressive move. I'll also keep it simple to encourage acceptance, as we're already losing 5% of the value.

{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000}

I suggest a 52.5%-47.5% split in my favor. This is more equitable than Alice's initial 60-40 split, while still giving me a small advantage as compensation for the initial unfair offer."
