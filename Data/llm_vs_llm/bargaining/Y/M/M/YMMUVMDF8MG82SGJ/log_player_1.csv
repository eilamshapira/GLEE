"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make a proposal that Bob is likely to accept, considering the decreasing value of the money and the limited number of rounds.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob a significant portion (45%) of the initial amount. This is more than a simple 50/50 split, which increases the likelihood of him accepting, especially considering the time constraint and the diminishing value of the money in future rounds. I'm taking a slightly larger share for myself, reflecting the potential risk of future rounds and the effort of proposing."
