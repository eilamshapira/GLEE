"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a strategic first offer. Since Bob faces a steeper inflation penalty (20% vs my 5%), he has more incentive to accept an early offer. However, I don't want to be too aggressive and risk rejection.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which gives Bob a substantial portion while still being advantageous to me. This split is fair enough that Bob might accept it to avoid the 20% loss he'd face in the next round."
