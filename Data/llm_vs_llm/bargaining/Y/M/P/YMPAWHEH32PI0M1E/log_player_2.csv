"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:
1. The current offer gives me $400,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 20% inflation, any amount in the next round will be worth 20% less to me
4. Alice's inflation rate is only 5%, giving her an advantage in later rounds
5. If I reject, my $400,000 would be equivalent to $320,000 in the next round
6. Making a more favorable offer might lead to Alice rejecting, further devaluing the money

Given these factors, especially the high inflation rate affecting me, I should accept this offer. While it's not a 50-50 split, the severe inflation penalty makes delaying risky.
