Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":800000,""bob_gain"":200000,""message"":""Let's divide the money fairly. I take the larger portion since I made the proposal.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50-50 split which is perfectly fair for both of us. There's no reason one of us should get substantially more than the other. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
