"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide the money fairly. I take the larger portion since I made the proposal. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer seems quite uneven, offering only 20% of the total to me while she would take 80%. Given that we have many rounds left and I don't face any inflation pressure, I can afford to negotiate for a better deal.
