"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4,500 out of $10,000
2. If I reject and move to next round, my money will be worth 5% less
3. $4,500 in this round is better than $4,750 in the next round (due to 5% inflation)
4. The offer is reasonably fair, though slightly in Alice's favor
5. Beginning with a rejection might lead to a more adversarial negotiation

Given these factors, especially considering the inflation penalty that only affects me, I'll accept this offer.
