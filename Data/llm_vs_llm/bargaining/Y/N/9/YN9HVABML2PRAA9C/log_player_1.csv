Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The longer the game continues, the more I lose due to inflation.  Delaying further significantly eats into my potential gains.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems firm in his position and unlikely to offer significantly more. Holding out for a marginally better deal in future rounds is risky, as Bob could become even more demanding. 
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting now provides a guaranteed payout, albeit less than desired. Rejecting risks further losses and potential for an even less favorable outcome later.

This decision prioritizes mitigating losses from inflation and securing a reasonable, though not perfect, outcome."
