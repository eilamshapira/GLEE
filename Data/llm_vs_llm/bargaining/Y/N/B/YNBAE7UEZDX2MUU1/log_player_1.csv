"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer for the first round, keeping in mind that inflation reduces the value by 20% each round, so it's beneficial to reach an agreement early.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a slightly favorable split for me since I'm making the first offer. With 20% inflation each round for me, we should try to agree early. If we wait until round 2, the $100 is only worth $80 to me, so this is actually a fair deal considering the time pressure.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, considering the inflation impact on both of us. It's better than risking further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
