"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a slightly favorable split for me since I'm making the first offer. With 20% inflation each round for me, we should try to agree early. If we wait until round 2, the $100 is only worth $80 to me, so this is actually a fair deal considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
