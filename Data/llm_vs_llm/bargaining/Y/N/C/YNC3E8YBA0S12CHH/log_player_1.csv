"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Given that money devalues more quickly for you (10% per round) than for me (5% per round), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. This is a fair offer considering these circumstances.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about the devaluation, but your initial offer was too skewed in your favor. I propose a 45/55 split. This recognizes the time pressure we both face while still being more equitable. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
