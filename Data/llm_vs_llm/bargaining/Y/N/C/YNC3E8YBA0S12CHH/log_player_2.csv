"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. Given that money devalues more quickly for you (10% per round) than for me (5% per round), it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. This is a fair offer considering these circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your point about the devaluation, but your initial offer was too skewed in your favor. I propose a 45/55 split. This recognizes the time pressure we both face while still being more equitable.""}"
