"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully.

Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split: $5,000 for me (Bob) and $5,000 for her.

This is a completely fair split of the money. If I reject and we go to the next round, inflation will reduce the total value by 5%, meaning we'd only be dividing $9,500 total. Even if I were to propose a more favorable split for myself in the next round, Alice could reject it, and we'd lose another 5% to inflation.

Given that Alice started with a completely fair offer, I should accept it.
