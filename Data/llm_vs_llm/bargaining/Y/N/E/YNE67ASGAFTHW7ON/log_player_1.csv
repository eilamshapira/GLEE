"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $55 and you receive $45. Accepting this offer now avoids the 5% depreciation in my share for future rounds, ensuring a fair and prompt resolution. Looking forward to your agreement.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 50-50 split, ensuring we both receive an equal share. This seems fair, considering we're in the early rounds and inflation hasn't had a significant impact yet. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Bob, while a 50-50 split at this point might look fair at face value, due to the inflation effect my share has already dropped 5%, accepting now would mean I get an effective value equivalent to $47.5 compared to round 1 dollars. I believe we can do better in the next round if we continue negotiating, so I’m going to reject your proposal for now.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in round 3 my money is now worth only 90% of its original value, so waiting further will only hurt both of us. To avoid further inflation losses and to ensure we finalize the deal quickly, I'm proposing a division where you receive $52 and I get $48. I realize this gives you a slight nominal advantage relative to an even split, compensating for any uncertainty you might face about future rounds. I believe this offer is a fair way to protect both our interests under the current inflation pressures and would appreciate your prompt acceptance.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the significant impact of inflation on my share, I need to adjust the proposal to compensate for the loss. I'm offering a 57-43 split in my favor. This takes into account the 36% decrease in value for my share, while your share has only decreased by 9.75%. I believe this is a fair adjustment, given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 43 
# Bob gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Bob, after evaluating both our positions under these inflation adjustments, your proposal actually provides me with a favorable outcome. Although nominally I receive $43, the inflation adjustment means I’m effectively getting about $36.88 in round‑1 value, while your adjusted share comes to roughly $29.18. Given this and wanting to avoid further losses from waiting, I accept your proposal. Let's finalize this deal!""}"
