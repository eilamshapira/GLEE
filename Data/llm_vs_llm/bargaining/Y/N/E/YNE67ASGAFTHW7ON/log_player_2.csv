Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, in round 3 my money is now worth only 90% of its original value, so waiting further will only hurt both of us. To avoid further inflation losses and to ensure we finalize the deal quickly, I'm proposing a division where you receive $52 and I get $48. I realize this gives you a slight nominal advantage relative to an even split, compensating for any uncertainty you might face about future rounds. I believe this offer is a fair way to protect both our interests under the current inflation pressures and would appreciate your prompt acceptance. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48

This takes into account the 36% decrease in value for my share, while your share has only decreased by 9.75%. I believe this is a fair adjustment, given the circumstances.""}"
