"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I think 55/45 is a good start. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer. She's proposing a 55/45 split, where I would get $45 and she would get $55.

Let me think about this strategically. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total amount will decrease by 5% to $95. This means that even if I proposed a perfectly fair 50/50 split in the next round, I would get $47.50, which is only $2.50 more than Alice's current offer. And that's assuming Alice would accept my counter-offer.

Since the potential gain from rejecting is relatively small compared to the risk of further depreciation if negotiations continue, I'll accept this offer.
