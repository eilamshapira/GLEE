"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll send my offer to Bob. Since Bob faces a 20% decrease in value each round, I'll try to make a fair offer that incentivizes him to accept now rather than delaying.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal split of the money. This is a fair division that gives us both the same amount, and Bob should consider accepting it since his share would be worth less if he rejects and we move to another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer that accounts for the inflation that Bob faces. Since Bob's money loses 20% value each round, if we reach round 4, his share would be worth even less to him.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm offering Bob $5,500, which is better than the $6,000 that would be worth only $4,800 to him in the next round due to the 20% inflation. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges Bob's time preference while improving my position slightly from his previous offer."
