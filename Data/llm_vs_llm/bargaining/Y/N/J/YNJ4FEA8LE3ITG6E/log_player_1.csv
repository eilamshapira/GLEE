Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we settle right now: I take $950K and you get $50K.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your previous offer was too steep. I'm willing to split it more evenly to account for the inflation risk we both face. Let's settle for this and avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

If you reject this proposal, you'll be moving to a round where you must make an offer while facing even steeper devaluation on your money. To avoid that disadvantage, I’m offering you $10K (which, despite the inflation, is far more than what you’d end up with by waiting) while I keep $990K. I believe this is a practical, forward-looking offer that helps us both avoid further losses. Let’s settle it now!""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offers have been increasingly unfair. I understand you might not be affected by inflation, but I am. This is my best offer considering the circumstances. Let's settle this before the money loses more value for me. 
# Alice gain: 455000 
# Bob gain: 545000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about inflation eroding the value of your share in every delay. I've calculated that waiting will only cost you more in real value. To ensure you secure an effective value that's better than what further rounds could offer, I'm proposing that I take $400,000 while you receive $600,000. This offer guarantees you a higher effective payout than what you’d expect if you get to propose in a future round with even steeper inflation. Let's settle now and preserve as much value as possible for both of us.""}"
