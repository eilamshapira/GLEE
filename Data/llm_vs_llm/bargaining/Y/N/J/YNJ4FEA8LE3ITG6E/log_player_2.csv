"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle right now: I take $950K and you get $50K. Accepting this offer immediately avoids any potential complications (and inflation effects) in later rounds. I believe this is fair given the circumstances, and I look forward to your prompt agreement. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Alice, your previous offer was too steep. I'm willing to split it more evenly to account for the inflation risk we both face. Let's settle for this and avoid further devaluation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand the worries about inflation – every extra round further erodes the value of your share. If you reject this proposal, you'll be moving to a round where you must make an offer while facing even steeper devaluation on your money. To avoid that disadvantage, I’m offering you $10K (which, despite the inflation, is far more than what you’d end up with by waiting) while I keep $990K. I believe this is a practical, forward-looking offer that helps us both avoid further losses. Let’s settle it now! 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about inflation eroding the value of your share in every delay. I've calculated that waiting will only cost you more in real value. To ensure you secure an effective value that's better than what further rounds could offer, I'm proposing that I take $400000 while you receive $600000. This offer guarantees you a higher effective payout than what you’d expect if you get to propose in a future round with even steeper inflation. Let's settle now and preserve as much value as possible for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000
