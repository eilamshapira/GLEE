"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me think strategically about this. Since I'm making the first offer, I need to consider:
1. The inflation penalty (20% for me, 10% for Bob per round)
2. Bob's rational decision-making
3. The total sum of $1,000,000

I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me, but fair enough that Bob should accept rather than risk inflation:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I think this is a reasonable first offer because:
1. It's close to a 50-50 split, showing good faith
2. If Bob declines, both of us will lose value due to inflation
3. The difference isn't so large that it would compel Bob to counter-offer"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. If I accept Bob's offer:
   * I get $400,000 at 80% value = $320,000 effective value
   * Bob gets $600,000 at 90% value = $540,000 effective value

2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3:
   * My money will be worth 60% of original value
   * Bob's money will be worth 80% of original value
   * This further devaluation makes any future negotiations less valuable for both of us

3. This offer, while not ideal, still gives me a significant portion at a reasonable value, and avoiding further inflation is important.
