"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about Alice's offer. She's proposing an even 50/50 split, which might seem fair at first glance. However, I need to consider the inflation effect.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will be 20% less for me. That means the $100 pot would effectively be worth only $80 to me in the next round. Even if I got all $80, that's worse than taking $50 now.

Given this information, accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking further rounds with inflation.
