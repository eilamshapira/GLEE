600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you still get a substantial amount.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, let's start with a slightly more equitable split. I propose 55-45 in my favor. We both want a good outcome, and this reflects a reasonable compromise early on.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, considering the inflation affecting your gains, I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor. This is actually more favorable to you than it might appear at first glance, as delaying further will only decrease the real value of your share. Let's reach an agreement now while the money still holds more value for you.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, I understand the inflation is hitting my gains. I'm proposing 52-48. It's a small adjustment, but I am still taking a hit because of inflation. Let's agree now.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, let's be practical. With the current inflation of 48.8% affecting your gains, delaying further significantly hurts your position. This 65-35 split actually gives you $350000 now, which is worth more than a larger number later with even higher inflation. I suggest we conclude this now for our mutual benefit.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, inflation is really hurting my potential gain. Let's split it 50-50. It is fair and avoids further losses for me and gives you a good deal too.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, with inflation at 67.23% affecting your gains, we need to be realistic. This offer of $250000 to you now is actually worth more than a larger amount in future rounds as inflation continues to rise. Your $250000 now is better than $500000 or more later when it will be worth much less. Let's conclude this now before your position weakens further.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, I know inflation is hitting me hard, but you are still getting the same value. Let's do 45-55. This is me compromising significantly, and it's much better than losing everything.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
850000.0,150000.0,"Bob, with inflation at 79.03% affecting your gains, we're reaching a critical point. Your $150000 now is worth more than $450000 in your last offer due to the severe inflation impact. We only have 3 rounds left after this, and your position will continue to weaken. This is a pragmatic offer that you should accept now to avoid an even worse outcome.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Alice, this is getting desperate. I'm offering 40-60. It's a huge concession on my part. Please, let's just take something rather than nothing.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
900000.0,100000.0,"Bob, we're down to the final two rounds, and with inflation at 86.58% severely impacting your gains, this is your best realistic option. Your $100000 now is actually worth more than larger amounts in the next round due to increasing inflation. If we don't agree now or in the next round, we both get nothing. This offer gives you something meaningful rather than risking everything.",Alice,11,
