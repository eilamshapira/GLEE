Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation affecting your gains, I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor. This is actually more favorable to you than it might appear at first glance, as delaying further will only decrease the real value of your share. Let's reach an agreement now while the money still holds more value for you.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. With the current inflation of 48.8% affecting your gains, delaying further significantly hurts your position. This 65-35 split actually gives you $350000 now, which is worth more than a larger number later with even higher inflation. I suggest we conclude this now for our mutual benefit.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, with inflation at 67.23% affecting your gains, we need to be realistic. This offer of $250000 to you now is actually worth more than a larger amount in future rounds as inflation continues to rise. Your $250000 now is better than $500000 or more later when it will be worth much less. Let's conclude this now before your position weakens further.
