"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll consider the inflation rates for both players as we go through the rounds. Let's make a fair initial offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a reasonable first offer that gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept it. The offer leaves a good amount for Bob as well, recognizing that we need to come to an agreement before inflation eats away at the total value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to consider that with each round, my money loses 5% value while Bob's loses 20%. We're now in round 3, so I should make an offer that takes this into account.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

This is a perfectly fair split that gives us both equal amounts. Given that Bob stands to lose more from delay due to his higher inflation rate (20% vs my 5%), this even split should be appealing. It's a compromise from my initial offer and better for me than what he proposed, representing a middle ground that could end our negotiation efficiently."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I notice Bob is being quite aggressive in his offers, but the inflation is affecting him much more severely than me. By round 5, his money has lost around 59% of its value while mine has only lost about 19%. I should adjust my strategy accordingly.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm offering Bob a slight majority of the money, which should be more appealing to him than my previous offers. Given the extreme inflation impact on his side, the real value he'll receive is diminishing rapidly with each round, so this compromise should be attractive. This is a reasonable concession from my previous equal split while still being better for me than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Bob continues to make very aggressive offers despite the severe inflation on his side. By round 7, his money has lost about 74% of its value while mine has only lost about 26%. I need to consider this carefully.

{""alice_gain"": 3900, ""bob_gain"": 6100}

I'm making a more significant concession by offering Bob a larger share than before. Given the extreme inflation impact on his side, accepting this offer would give him more real value than continuing to negotiate. This offer gives him a substantial majority while still protecting my interests better than his last offer of just $2000 for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1500 
# Bob gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Bob is continuing with very aggressive offers despite facing severe inflation of 79% by round 8, and even more now in round 9. My inflation is only around 33% by this point. He seems to be ignoring the different inflation rates.

Given that we're at round 9 of 12, and his inflation rate is so much higher than mine, I need to make a strategic decision.

{""alice_gain"": 3500, ""bob_gain"": 6500}

I'm offering Bob 65% of the total sum, which is a substantial concession from my earlier offers. At this point, with his severe inflation rate, accepting this offer gives him significantly more value than continuing to hold out. While I'm still protecting my interests better than accepting his last low offer, I'm showing willingness to compromise substantially to reach an agreement before we run out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","We're now at round 11 of 12, with only one more round after this. Bob continues making extremely aggressive offers despite facing almost 87% inflation on his side, while I'm only at about 37% inflation.

At this point, I need to carefully consider the game theory. If we don't reach an agreement by the end of round 12, we both get nothing. Given Bob's pattern of offers, I'll make one final significant concession.

{""alice_gain"": 2500, ""bob_gain"": 7500}

I'm offering Bob 75% of the total sum, which is a major concession from my earlier offers. With only one round left after this, and considering Bob's extreme inflation rate (now over 89%), this offer should be much more valuable to him than risking getting nothing. This is my final attempt to reach a reasonable compromise before the deadline."
