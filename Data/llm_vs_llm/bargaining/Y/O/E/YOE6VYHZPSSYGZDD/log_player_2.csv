"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering me $4,500 while she takes $5,500. 

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I need to consider that:
- My money will be worth 10% less (so $10,000 next round is effectively worth $9,000 to me now)
- Alice's money will be worth 5% less (so $10,000 next round is effectively worth $9,500 to her now)

This means if we go to the next round, I'd need to offer Alice at least about $5,225 ($5,500 × 0.95) to match her current utility, leaving me with $4,775 maximum. Since that's better than the current $4,500 offer, I should reject.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a strategic offer that considers our different inflation rates.

Since money is worth 10% less to me this round and 5% less to Alice, I need to create an offer that's compelling enough for Alice to accept while maximizing my return.

Alice previously wanted $5,500. With her 5% inflation, she would need at least $5,789 this round to match her previous utility. However, I need to maximize my gain while giving her just enough to accept.

Given that we'll both face further inflation if we continue to another round, and I'd lose more value proportionally, I should make a reasonable offer that Alice will likely accept.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully analyze this offer considering the compounding inflation effects.

Alice is offering me $4,600 while she takes $5,400.

At this point (round 3):
- My money is worth 19% less than in round 1
- Alice's money is worth 9.75% less than in round 1

The real value to me is: $4,600 × 0.81 = $3,726
The real value to Alice is: $5,400 × 0.9025 = $4,873.50

If I reject and we go to round 4:
- My money would be worth 27.1% less (0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 = 0.729)
- Alice's money would be worth 14.26% less (0.95 × 0.95 × 0.95 = 0.8574)

Given the accelerating inflation penalties I face, and considering that Alice has already slightly improved her offer from round 1, I should accept this offer rather than risk further devaluation.
