# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is slightly better than her last, but still heavily favors Alice.  The inflation is hurting her more than me, so I'll continue to hold out for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'm offering you a generous 35% - take it before it shrinks further!""}"

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Alice is right that this is getting serious, her offer is still not equitable. The inflation is working in my favor, and I'm willing to gamble that she'll become more agreeable soon."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm offering you 30% before inflation makes it 25%.  Let's be realistic and end this.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, one last push.  I'm trying to be fair.  Take this or we both lose.  This is the best I can do. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is cutting it close, but Alice seems firm, and getting only slightly less than half is better than nothing if this drags on."
