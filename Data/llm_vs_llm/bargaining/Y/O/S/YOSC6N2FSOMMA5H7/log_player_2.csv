"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. With inflation affecting future rounds, this equal division maximizes our joint outcome now without risking diminishing returns for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an equal split of $50 each, which seems fair on the surface. She mentions inflation, though the problem states that inflation is 0% for me, so waiting doesn't technically reduce the value of my potential earnings.

However, there's uncertainty about how inflation affects Alice, which could give me negotiation leverage in future rounds if I reject. On the other hand, a 50-50 split is objectively fair, and there's no guarantee I could secure a better deal in subsequent rounds.

Given that $50 is a reasonable amount and represents an equal division, I'll accept this offer.
