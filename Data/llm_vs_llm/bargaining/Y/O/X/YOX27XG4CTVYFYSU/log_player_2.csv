"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer and make a decision.

Alice is proposing a 50-50 split of the $100, which would give each of us $50. This is a fair and equal division.

She mentions avoiding inflation losses, which is a good point. While the instructions say inflation makes the money worth 0% less for me (meaning no actual inflation effect for my side), I don't know how inflation affects Alice.

Given that this is a fair split in the very first round, and there's no disadvantage to concluding early:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
