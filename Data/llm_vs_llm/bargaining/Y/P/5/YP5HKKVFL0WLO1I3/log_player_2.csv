"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing I get $4000 and she gets $6000. Let me think about this...

Given the inflation factor (5% per round for me, 0% for Alice), if I reject now and propose a better deal next round, the total value will be worth 5% less to me. That means every $100 would be worth only $95 to me in the next round.

If I reject this offer, the maximum I could reasonably get next round would be more than $4000, but it would be worth 5% less to me. Plus, Alice could reject my counteroffer, leading to further rounds and more inflation for me.

$4000 now is a decent offer considering we have the inflation penalty. It's not an even split, but given the asymmetric inflation, it's reasonable.
