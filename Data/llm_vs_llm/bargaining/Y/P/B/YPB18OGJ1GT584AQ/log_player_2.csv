"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, the effective amount is $100 * 0.8 = $80. For Alice, it's $100 * 0.9 = $90.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the effective amounts.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective amount for me is $100 * 0.64 (1 - 0.2 - 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.64,  20% less in round 1 and then another 20% less of the remaining 80% in round 2, which is 20% * 0.8 = 0.16, so 0.8 - 0.16 = 0.64) and for Alice is $100 * 0.81 (1 - 0.1 - 0.1 * 0.9 = 0.81, 10% less in round 1 and then another 10% less of the remaining 90% in round 2).

Given Alice's offer of $45 for me and $55 for her, I need to decide if this is acceptable.

Since the offer gives me $45, which is equivalent to $45 * 0.64 / 0.64 = $45 in the current value for me, but considering the original value, it's $45 / 0.64 ≈ $70.31 in the first round's value, and Alice gets $55, which is $55 * 0.81 / 0.81 = $55 in the current value for her, but considering the original value, it's $55 / 0.81 ≈ $67.90 in the first round's value.

Given that I rejected an offer of $40 in the first round, this offer seems more reasonable considering the inflation.
