Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering our discount rates (I lose 5% per round while you lose 10%), if you wait for round 3 you'll face an even lower real value. By accepting my offer now, you secure a fair share relative to your future prospects. Let's settle and both avoid further devaluation! 
# Alice gain: 31 
# Bob gain: 69 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
