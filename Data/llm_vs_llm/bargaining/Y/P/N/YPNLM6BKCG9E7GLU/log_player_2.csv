Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 69, ""alice_gain"": 31, ""message"": ""Alice, considering our discount rates (I lose 5% per round while you lose 10%), if you wait for round 3 you'll face an even lower real value. By accepting my offer now, you secure a fair share relative to your future prospects. Let's settle and both avoid further devaluation!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's my turn now, and I'm feeling generous. This offer still gives you a decent share, and it prevents further losses for both of us from inflation. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
