4500.0,5500.0,"I notice your money is losing value quickly due to inflation (36% already), while mine isn't affected by inflation at all. Given this difference in our situations, I'm proposing a 55-45 split that favors me slightly. This is fair considering I can wait longer without losing value.",Bob,4,

4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I understand you're facing significant inflation - now nearly 60%. My money isn't losing value, which puts me in a stronger negotiating position. I'm now proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This actually gives you more real value than if we continue negotiating for more rounds while your money keeps losing value. I suggest we reach an agreement now.",Bob,6,
