"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing a split where I get $4,000 and she gets $6,000. This is not an equal split of the $10,000.

Given that:
1) I don't have information about Alice's inflation rate
2) I know my own inflation rate is 0% (meaning the money's value doesn't decrease for me over time)
3) We have 12 rounds total to reach an agreement
4) This is only round 1

I believe I can propose a more favorable split in the next round. Since there's no penalty for me to continue negotiating (0% inflation), I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equal split since we're dividing a fixed amount.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split of the money. This gives us both an equal share of $5,000.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of my first offer and your 50-50 split 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice has revealed that her inflation rate is significant - the money is worth 36% less to her now than in round 1. This means her negotiating position weakens with each round that passes.

Since my inflation rate is 0%, I have the advantage of time. Alice appears to be trying to reach a compromise by moving from her initial 40-60 split toward my 50-50 proposal, but the shift is minimal.

Given Alice's high inflation rate and my lack of inflation, I can likely get a better deal by continuing negotiations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I notice your money is losing value quickly due to inflation (36% already), while mine isn't affected by inflation at all. Given this difference in our situations, I'm proposing a 55-45 split that favors me slightly. This is fair considering I can wait longer without losing value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still willing to compromise, but need a fairer split considering my losses 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice's inflation has increased significantly - now at 59.04% less value than in round 1. Despite this weakening position, Alice is only offering me $4,400, which is still less than half of the total amount.

Given:
1) My inflation rate is 0%, so I have no time pressure
2) Alice's inflation rate is severe and growing rapidly
3) We still have 7 more potential rounds of negotiation
4) Alice's position will continue to weaken with each round

It makes strategic sense for me to continue negotiating for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're facing significant inflation - now nearly 60%. My money isn't losing value, which puts me in a stronger negotiating position. I'm now proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This actually gives you more real value than if we continue negotiating for more rounds while your money keeps losing value. I suggest we reach an agreement now.""}"
