"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. This is less than half (40% for me, 60% for her)
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
4. There's no inflation penalty for me, so I don't lose value by waiting
5. I can likely propose a more favorable split in the next round

Given these factors, I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer, but still slightly in my favor since I have the proposing power now:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

My reasoning:
1. This is a fairer split than Alice's initial offer
2. It gives me a slight advantage (55%) but not so greedy that it's likely to be rejected
3. Since Alice pushed for a 60-40 split in her favor, she demonstrates she's willing to propose uneven splits
4. If she rejects, she'll have to make another offer, and I'll still have another chance"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me $4,500 (45% of the total)
2. This is better than her first offer ($4,000)
3. I know that Alice is experiencing inflation (9.75% less value for her)
4. For Alice, her $5,500 is actually worth less now due to inflation
5. I'm not affected by inflation, so my $4,500 maintains full value
6. If I reject, we continue to another round, but Alice's inflation will increase further
7. This offer is more balanced than the previous ones

Given that:
- The split is more reasonable now (45-55)
- Alice is already experiencing inflation penalties
- I'm getting a better deal than the first round
- There's a risk of continued back-and-forth if I reject

I'll accept this offer.
