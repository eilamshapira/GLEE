"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a split that accounts for the 10% depreciation per round that affects my gains. Since I want to reach an agreement quickly and fairly, I'll offer a slightly favorable split to Bob to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

I propose this division because it gives Bob a slight advantage while still securing a reasonable amount for myself. I want to avoid multiple rounds since that would reduce the value of my share due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is too unfavorable for me. Even accounting for the 10% depreciation on my next proposal, I can make a better counter-offer in the next round. With Bob's current proposal, I would only get $3000 (worth $2700 due to inflation), while Bob would get $7000. That's too unbalanced."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since we're in round 3, my gains will be worth 20% less due to inflation. I need to balance making an attractive offer to Bob while protecting my interests given the depreciation.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split because:
1. For me, the $5000 is actually worth $4000 due to 20% inflation
2. For Bob, his $5000 maintains full value
3. This is a fair offer that should be appealing to Bob, as he gets full value
4. If Bob rejects this balanced offer, I'll lose even more value in the next round"
