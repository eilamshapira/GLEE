"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my offer: you get all $100 and I take nothing. I realize that if you turn this down you’d be in a position to propose next round and secure the full amount for yourself—with zero discounting on your end. To keep things efficient and avoid further complications (and my money losing value with inflation), I hope you accept this offer now. 
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is quite unusual and seems to be confusing. She's offering me all $100 and taking nothing for herself. While this is extremely favorable to me, I should clarify the situation.

The normal structure of this game would involve dividing the money between both players. Since the money doesn't lose value for me between rounds but loses 5% value per round for Alice, I actually have a strategic advantage if we go to later rounds.

Given that Alice's offer gives me the maximum possible amount ($100), which is better than any alternative I could propose in the next round, I'll accept this offer.
