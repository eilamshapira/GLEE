"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest we split the money equally to be fair. With inflation reducing the value each round, this gives us both the maximum value now. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. It's a fair 50-50 split
2. If I reject, the next round will have the money worth 5% less (only $95 total)
3. Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further depreciation
4. The equal split is a rational and fair solution that maximizes value for both parties
