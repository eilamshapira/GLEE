"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid risk 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. While a 50-50 split seems fair at first glance, I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty I face with each round. If I reject now, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total value to me will be reduced by 5%.

If I accept now, I get $50 at full value.
If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the $100 will be worth 5% less to me, so I'd need to get more than $52.63 to come out ahead (since $52.63 Ã— 0.95 = $50).

Given that this is a fair initial offer and considering the inflation risk, I'll accept.
