"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. It's a fair 50-50 split
2. Being in round 1, I have many rounds left to negotiate
3. However, with inflation being 0% for me, I don't lose value by accepting now
4. There's a risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement
5. This is a reasonable first offer that gives me half of the total amount

While I could try to negotiate for more, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal, and there's a risk of getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds. A fair split in the first round seems like a good outcome.
