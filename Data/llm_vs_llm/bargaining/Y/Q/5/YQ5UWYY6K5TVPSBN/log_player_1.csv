"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob considering that with each passing round, the money will be worth 20% less to me, but not to Bob. This creates an asymmetry that gives Bob some leverage.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because while a 50-50 division might seem fair in a vacuum, the time pressure affects me more than Bob. By offering Bob a substantial portion upfront, I hope to avoid going to another round where the total value decreases for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 10000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I see that Bob has made an extremely aggressive offer. Let me make a more reasonable counter-offer that acknowledges the inflation pressure I'm facing.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a perfectly equal split now. Given that the money is worth less to me with each round, this is actually a concession from my initial offer. A 50-50 split is objectively fair, and considering that rejecting this would lead to another round where the money is worth even less to me, I hope Bob will recognize this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
