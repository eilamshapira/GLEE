"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 5% inflation:
   * Next round my money will be worth 5% less
   * So if I get $40 next round, it would only be worth $38 in current value

Even though the split isn't completely fair (60-40 in Alice's favor), rejecting might put me in a worse position due to inflation. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush, especially with inflation!
