"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept, considering the decreasing value of the money for both of us each round.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

My reasoning:

*   **Fairness:** I'm starting with a slight advantage for myself (55/45 split). I believe this is reasonable given I'm the one initiating the offer.
*   **Bob's Perspective:** Bob needs to see enough value in this offer to outweigh the potential gain he might get in later rounds, especially considering the 20% decrease in value for him per round. 450,000 is a substantial amount.
*   **Future Rounds:** If Bob rejects this, the money is worth less, and I'll need to offer him more in later rounds. Starting with a relatively reasonable offer seems like a good strategy to maximize my overall gain while ensuring a deal happens within the 12-round limit."
