"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $400,000 while she takes $600,000 of the $1,000,000. 

While this isn't an equal split, I need to factor in the 10% inflation penalty per round. If I reject and make a counter-offer, even if Alice accepts in round 2, my share would be worth 10% less. And if negotiations extend further, the value continues to decrease for me.

Given the inflation risk, getting $400,000 now is better than potentially getting slightly more but worth less later, or risking getting nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds.
