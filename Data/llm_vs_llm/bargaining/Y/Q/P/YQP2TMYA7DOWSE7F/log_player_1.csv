"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1. I'll start with a generous split to hopefully get Bob to agree quickly, considering the time decay.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this. Bob's offering a 50/50 split.

*   **My Gain:** $50, but worth 10% less than round 1, so effectively $45.

I'll accept this, as it seems fair enough considering the rapid decay.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
