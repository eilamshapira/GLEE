"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. An even 50-50 split ($5000 each) is generally considered fair
2. If I reject, I'll make the next offer, but:
   - The total value will be reduced by 10% for me
   - Any further negotiation rounds will continue to reduce value
   - I don't know how inflation affects Alice's valuation
3. Getting $5000 now is better than risking getting less in future rounds

Given these considerations, this is a reasonable first offer and there's more risk than potential gain in rejecting it.
