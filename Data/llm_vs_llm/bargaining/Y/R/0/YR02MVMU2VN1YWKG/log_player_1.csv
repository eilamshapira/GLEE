"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob, keeping in mind that the money becomes 5% less valuable to me with each passing round.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I think this is a fair initial offer that gives both of us a substantial portion of the money. I'm offering slightly more to myself since I know I face 5% inflation each round, while Bob's inflation situation is unknown to me."
