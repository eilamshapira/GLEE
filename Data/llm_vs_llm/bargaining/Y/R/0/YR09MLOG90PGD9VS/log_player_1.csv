"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on a standard rational‐agent analysis of alternating‐offers bargaining with the twist that only my (Alice’s) money depreciates by 10% each additional round—while Bob’s value remains constant—the backward‐induction solution turns out very lopsided. (In informal terms, Bob is far less “impatient” than I am so he “wins” the bargaining.)

A rough sketch of the reasoning is as follows:

1. Suppose we get past round 1. In round 2 Bob gets to propose. In that round his own money is not discounted, whereas if I were to end up with money in round 3 (when I propose) it would be discounted by 0.9². Thus Bob can “secure” nearly the full $10,000 by offering me just enough so that my discounted future value (after another delay) barely beats my offer‐value. In effect, Bob’s continuation value if he rejects my round‑1 offer is approximately $10,000.

2. Knowing this, when I propose in round 1 (where my money is not discounted yet) Bob will only accept if he gets at least $10,000 now. (Any division that gives him less than $10,000 now is less attractive to him than waiting to propose himself—since his share does not suffer any discount.)

3. Thus, if I were to try to “claim” any positive amount for myself, Bob’s share in my offer would be less than $10,000, and he would prefer to reject and then secure nearly the entire pie in round 2.

Consequently, the only subgame‐perfect equilibrium is the “take‐it‐or‐leave‐it” offer in round 1 in which I (Alice) get nothing and Bob gets all $10,000. (Any deviation on my part leads Bob to reject and eventually capture everything since he does not suffer a discount.)

So, for Round 1, as Alice my offer is:

{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 10000}"
