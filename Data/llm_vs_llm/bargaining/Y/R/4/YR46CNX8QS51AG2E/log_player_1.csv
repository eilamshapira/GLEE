"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, the $3000 offered to me is actually worth $3000 * 0.95 = $2850.

Considering this, I think the offer is not in my favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less with each passing round, and this is the third round, the money I gain is now worth 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of its original value.

To make up for this loss, I'll make a slightly more favorable offer to myself.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less, the $4000 offered to me is actually worth $4000 * 0.8574 = $3429.60.

Considering this, I think the offer is still not very favorable to me, but the inflation is eating away at the value of the money, so I should consider accepting an offer that gives me a reasonable amount.

However, I'll reject this offer and try to make a better one in the next round, hoping that Bob's loss due to inflation will make him more willing to accept a more equal split.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less with each passing round, and this is the fifth round, the money I gain is now worth 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.8145 of its original value.

Considering the significant loss in value due to inflation, I'll make a more aggressive offer to myself to try to get a better deal.
