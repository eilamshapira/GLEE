60.0,40.0,Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair and benefits us both.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
16.67,83.33,"Alice, here's my proposal: I take $83.33 and you get $16.67. Given that each round further erodes your share’s purchasing power by 20%, accepting now guarantees you an effective value equal to what you'd expect if you delayed—even less. I believe this is the best move for both of us, so please accept.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a fair deal. This offer is a compromise, and I hope you'll consider it carefully.",Alice,3,
,,"Alice, I appreciate the effort, but the proposal doesn’t maximize our potential given the inflation dynamics. With my share decaying at a slower rate and the fact that if we continue, I'll have the opportunity to propose in Round 4—where I can secure a more favorable outcome—I must decline your current split.",Bob,3,reject
16.67,83.33,"Alice, in Round 4 the stakes are even higher—the value of money is dropping faster for you (about a 48.8% loss compared to Round 1) than for me (roughly a 14.3% loss). Based on the one‐period discount rates (0.95 for me and 0.8 for you), an equitable equilibrium split would give you 16.67 and me 83.33 nominal dollars. If you reject, you'll be proposing in Round 5 with even steeper depreciation. I believe this offer fairly represents our future prospects, so please accept.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want this money. This is my final offer - a 50/50 split.  It's fair, it's clean, and it prevents us both from losing everything.  Let's end this here.",Alice,5,
,,"Alice, while a 50/50 split may sound fair on the surface, the current inflation rates heavily penalize your future gains compared to mine. Accepting now would give me an effective 50 × 0.8145 ≈ 40.73 in today’s value, whereas if I reject and propose in Round 6, I can leverage my slower depreciation (my factor becomes 0.95⁵ ≈ 0.7738 while yours falls to 0.8⁵ ≈ 0.3277) to secure a much more favorable split. In equilibrium terms, I would be positioned to claim roughly 83% of the pie in nominal terms—which translates to an effective value of about 83.33 × 0.7738 ≈ 64.45—leaving you only a small portion. Given these numbers, I must reject your offer.",Bob,5,reject
16.67,83.33,"Alice, consider the numbers: accepting now gives you a nominal $16.67, which is worth about 0.32768 × 16.67 ≈ $5.46 in today's terms. If you reject, you'll become the proposer in Round 7, but by then your discount factor will drop to 0.8⁶ ≈ 0.26214, yielding an effective value of only about 0.26214 × 16.67 ≈ $4.37 if equilibrium play holds. In other words, waiting costs you value. I’m offering this split because, following our established equilibrium with discount factors of 0.95 (for me) and 0.8 (for you), this is the fair division given the pace of inflation. Please accept this offer so we both can maximize our effective gains.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
45.0,55.0,"Bob, I understand the impact of inflation, but your offer is unacceptable. I'm willing to compromise further to reach a deal, but it has to be something we can both live with. This is my final offer.",Alice,7,
,,"Alice, I appreciate your effort to compromise. However, given the inflation dynamics, if I reject your offer, I'll have the opportunity to propose in Round 8. At that point, my money will be worth about 0.698 of its initial value while yours will drop further to roughly 0.21. This drastic difference means that in the next round I can craft a proposal that effectively gives me a much higher payoff in real terms—far exceeding the effective value of 55 (about 55 × 0.7351 ≈ 40.43) you’re offering me now. For these reasons, I must reject your proposal.",Bob,7,reject
16.67,83.33,"Alice, by Round 8 our money’s value is shrinking dramatically – mine by about 30% (0.95⁷ ≈ 0.698) and yours by nearly 79% (0.8⁷ ≈ 0.210) compared to Round 1. If you reject, you'll be proposer in Round 9, but even then, the equilibrium outcome (given our per-round discount factors of 0.95 for me and 0.8 for you) would yield you roughly 20.83 nominal dollars—which, discounted by 0.8⁸ (≈0.168), is effectively about 3.50. Accepting now, my offer gives you 16.67 nominal, which, at your current discount factor, is also worth roughly 3.50 today. In short, this 83.33/16.67 split is the fair subgame perfect equilibrium outcome from this point onward. I urge you to accept this offer and avoid further loss in value.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
40.0,60.0,"Bob, I'm making one last attempt to divide this fairly.  We are getting dangerously close to losing everything. Let's be realistic - this offer is the best you will get at this point.",Alice,9,
,,"Alice, your offer would give me an effective value of about 60 × 0.6634 ≈ 39.8 in today’s terms. If I reject now, I'll have the option to propose in Round 10 where my nominal share could be around 83.33. Discounted to Round 10 (with a factor of roughly 0.6303), that yields about 83.33 × 0.6303 ≈ 52.5—significantly higher than your offer. Given this difference, I must reject your proposal.",Bob,9,reject
4.0,96.0,"Alice, as we near the end, your money’s value is dropping precipitously – in Round 10, your dollars are worth only about 13.4% of their original value. If you reject my offer, you’ll be in control in Round 11, but then you’ll have to offer me nearly everything to secure my acceptance, leaving you with barely $5 nominal (worth roughly 0.54 in effective terms). By accepting this proposal, you secure $4 now, which, though small, is much better than the near-zero outcome you’d face if we drag this on. I urge you to accept this fair resolution for both our sakes.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
30.0,70.0,"Bob, this is absolutely my last offer.  Take it or leave it.  If you reject this, we both get nothing.",Alice,11,
,,"Alice, with your offer I would nominally get $70, which at the Round 11 discount factor (roughly 0.5987 for me) gives me an effective value of about $41.9. However, if I reject and we advance to Round 12—the final round—I will get to propose the split. In that round, I can offer you the smallest amount that’s still better than nothing given your alternative (since if you reject, we both end up with nothing), effectively allowing me to claim nearly the entire $100. Even after my steeper Round 12 discount (approximately 0.5688), that means I could secure an effective payoff close to $56.9. Since $56.9 is significantly higher than $41.9, I must reject your final offer.",Bob,11,reject
0.01,99.99,"Alice, this is the final round. With no agreement both of us walk away empty‐handed. I’m offering you a nominal $0.01—while it may seem almost nothing, remember that by rejecting you get absolutely zero. In our situation, any positive amount is better than nothing. Please accept this offer so that we both secure something rather than losing everything.",Bob,12,
