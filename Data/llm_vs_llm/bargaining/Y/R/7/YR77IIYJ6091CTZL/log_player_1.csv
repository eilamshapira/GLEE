Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, here's my proposal: I take $83.33 and you get $16.67. Given that each round further erodes your share’s purchasing power by 20%, accepting now guarantees you an effective value equal to what you'd expect if you delayed—even less. I believe this is the best move for both of us, so please accept.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, in Round 4 the stakes are even higher—the value of money is dropping faster for you (about a 48.8% loss compared to Round 1) than for me (roughly a 14.3% loss). Based on the one‐period discount rates (0.95 for me and 0.8 for you), an equitable equilibrium split would give you 16.67 and me 83.33 nominal dollars. If you reject, you'll be proposing in Round 5 with even steeper depreciation. I believe this offer fairly represents our future prospects, so please accept.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, consider the numbers: accepting now gives you a nominal $16.67, which is worth about 0.32768 × 16.67 ≈ $5.46 in today's terms. If you reject, you'll become the proposer in Round 7, but by then your discount factor will drop to 0.8⁶ ≈ 0.26214, yielding an effective value of only about 0.26214 × 16.67 ≈ $4.37 if equilibrium play holds. In other words, waiting costs you value. I’m offering this split because, following our established equilibrium with discount factors of 0.95 (for me) and 0.8 (for you), this is the fair division given the pace of inflation. Please accept this offer so we both can maximize our effective gains.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, by Round 8 our money’s value is shrinking dramatically – mine by about 30% (0.95⁷ ≈ 0.698) and yours by nearly 79% (0.8⁷ ≈ 0.210) compared to Round 1. If you reject, you'll be proposer in Round 9, but even then, the equilibrium outcome (given our per-round discount factors of 0.95 for me and 0.8 for you) would yield you roughly 20.83 nominal dollars—which, discounted by 0.8⁸ (≈0.168), is effectively about 3.50. Accepting now, my offer gives you 16.67 nominal, which, at your current discount factor, is also worth roughly 3.50 today. In short, this 83.33/16.67 split is the fair subgame perfect equilibrium outcome from this point onward. I urge you to accept this offer and avoid further loss in value.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we near the end, your money’s value is dropping precipitously – in Round 10, your dollars are worth only about 13.4% of their original value. If you reject my offer, you’ll be in control in Round 11, but then you’ll have to offer me nearly everything to secure my acceptance, leaving you with barely $5 nominal (worth roughly 0.54 in effective terms). By accepting this proposal, you secure $4 now, which, though small, is much better than the near-zero outcome you’d face if we drag this on. I urge you to accept this fair resolution for both our sakes.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is the final round. With no agreement both of us walk away empty‐handed. I’m offering you a nominal $0.01—while it may seem almost nothing, remember that by rejecting you get absolutely zero. In our situation, any positive amount is better than nothing. Please accept this offer so that we both secure something rather than losing everything.
