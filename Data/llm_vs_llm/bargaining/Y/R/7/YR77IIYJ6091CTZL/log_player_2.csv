Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Round 4

Based on the one‐period discount rates (0.95 for me and 0.8 for you), an equitable equilibrium split would give you 16.67 and me 83.33 nominal dollars. If you reject, you'll be proposing in Round 5 with even steeper depreciation. I believe this offer fairly represents our future prospects, so please accept.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this money. This is my final offer - a 50/50 split.  It's fair, it's clean, and it prevents us both from losing everything.  Let's end this here.

# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Alice, while a 50/50 split may sound fair on the surface, the current inflation rates heavily penalize your future gains compared to mine. Accepting now would give me an effective 50 × 0.8145 ≈ 40.73 in today’s value, whereas if I reject and propose in Round 6, I can leverage my slower depreciation (my factor becomes 0.95⁵ ≈ 0.7738 while yours falls to 0.8⁵ ≈ 0.3277) to secure a much more favorable split. In equilibrium terms, I would be positioned to claim roughly 83% of the pie in nominal terms—which translates to an effective value of about 83.33 × 0.7738 ≈ 64.45—leaving you only a small portion. Given these numbers, I must reject your offer.""}"

Round 6

If you reject, you'll become the proposer in Round 7, but by then your discount factor will drop to 0.8⁶ ≈ 0.26214, yielding an effective value of only about 0.26214 × 16.67 ≈ $4.37 if equilibrium play holds. In other words, waiting costs you value. I’m offering this split because, following our established equilibrium with discount factors of 0.95 (for me) and 0.8 (for you), this is the fair division given the pace of inflation. Please accept this offer so we both can maximize our effective gains.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the impact of inflation, but your offer is unacceptable. I'm willing to compromise further to reach a deal, but it has to be something we can both live with. This is my final offer.

However, given the inflation dynamics, if I reject your offer, I'll have the opportunity to propose in Round 8. At that point, my money will be worth about 0.698 of its initial value while yours will drop further to roughly 0.21. This drastic difference means that in the next round I can craft a proposal that effectively gives me a much higher payoff in real terms—far exceeding the effective value of 55 (about 55 × 0.7351 ≈ 40.43) you’re offering me now. For these reasons, I must reject your proposal.""}"

If you reject, you'll be proposer in Round 9, but even then, the equilibrium outcome (given our per-round discount factors of 0.95 for me and 0.8 for you) would yield you roughly 20.83 nominal dollars—which, discounted by 0.8⁸ (≈0.168), is effectively about 3.50. Accepting now, my offer gives you 16.67 nominal, which, at your current discount factor, is also worth roughly 3.50 today. In short, this 83.33/16.67 split is the fair subgame perfect equilibrium outcome from this point onward. I urge you to accept this offer and avoid further loss in value.""}"

In that round, I can offer you the smallest amount that’s still better than nothing given your alternative (since if you reject, we both end up with nothing), effectively allowing me to claim nearly the entire $100.
