"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair but slightly advantageous first offer to Bob, showing good faith while maintaining my interests.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

I propose this split where I get $520,000 and Bob gets $480,000. This is a relatively fair split, with just a small advantage for me as the first mover. By offering Bob a substantial amount close to 50%, I hope to encourage acceptance and avoid value-destroying rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's slightly less favorable to me than my initial proposal, the 10% inflation penalty means that continuing to negotiate would reduce the real value of any future agreement. Getting $480,000 now is better than risking further devaluation through additional rounds of negotiation. This is a reasonable compromise that gives both parties a substantial share."
