"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm suggesting an equal split of the money. This seems fair to both of us, and we can avoid prolonging the game unnecessarily. Hope you find this acceptable! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering a 50-50 split ($5,000 each)
2. If I reject, the next round will have 20% inflation for me
3. That means in the next round, my money would be worth 20% less
4. If I propose $6,000 for myself next round, it would actually be worth $4,800 due to inflation
5. The current offer of $5,000 is better than what I might get after inflation

This is a fair offer, and considering the inflation penalty, it's better to accept now rather than risk getting less value in subsequent rounds.
