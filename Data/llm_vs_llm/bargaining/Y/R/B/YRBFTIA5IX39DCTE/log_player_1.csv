"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to be strategic and account for the potential loss in value due to inflation. Since this is round 1, I'll make a reasonable offer, hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further devaluation of the money.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","This is an outrageous offer! Bob is trying to take everything. Even with the inflation, 10,000 is still a significant amount, and getting nothing is unacceptable. I have to consider that Bob is facing inflation too, but his offer is simply too greedy.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, round 3. I need to be more strategic, considering both the inflation for myself and what Bob might be thinking. Inflation for me is now 20% less than in round 2. I need to make an offer that's appealing enough for him to accept, while still getting a decent amount for myself. Bob knows I rejected his first offer, so he might be expecting a more generous proposal.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
