400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, your initial offer wasn't balanced. Since the money depreciates 10% each round for you but 0% for me, I'm incentivized to wait. Let's find a fair middle ground - I propose I get 60% and you get 40%. This is reasonable given the inflation difference, and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation that would reduce the value for you.",Bob,2,
