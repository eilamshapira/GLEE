Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":900000,""bob_gain"":100000,""message"":""I believe this is a fair starting offer. Let's secure a deal!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer wasn't balanced. Since the money depreciates 10% each round for you but 0% for me, I'm incentivized to wait. Let's find a fair middle ground - I propose I get 60% and you get 40%. This is reasonable given the inflation difference, and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation that would reduce the value for you. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
