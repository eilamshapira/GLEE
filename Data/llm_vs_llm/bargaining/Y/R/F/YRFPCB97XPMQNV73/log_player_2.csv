"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe this is a fair starting offer. Let's secure a deal! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is not fair to me. Alice is proposing to take $900,000 while giving me only $100,000. Since there's no time pressure for me (0% inflation), I should negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer wasn't balanced. Since the money depreciates 10% each round for you but 0% for me, I'm incentivized to wait. Let's find a fair middle ground - I propose I get 60% and you get 40%. This is reasonable given the inflation difference, and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation that would reduce the value for you.""}"
