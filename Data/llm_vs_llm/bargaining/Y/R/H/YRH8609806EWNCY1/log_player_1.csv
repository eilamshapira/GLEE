"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll send my offer for Round 1.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800}

I offer a compromise that takes into account our different inflation rates. Since my money is devaluing faster, this more balanced split is fair and should work for both of us."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 3800, ""bob_gain"": 6200}

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the increasing inflation gap between us. This split recognizes that my money is devaluing much faster than yours, and we need to reach an agreement soon before inflation erodes too much value."
