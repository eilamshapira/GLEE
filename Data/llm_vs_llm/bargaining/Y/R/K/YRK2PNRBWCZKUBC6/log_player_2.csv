"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer from Alice.

She's proposing I get $4,000 and she gets $6,000 of the $10,000 total. While I do get a substantial amount, it's not an equal split. Since this is just the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer, I'll reject this and propose my own division in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair counteroffer that addresses the imbalance in Alice's initial proposal.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal split of the $10,000, with each of us receiving $5,000. This is the fairest distribution and reflects an equitable outcome for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's new offer.

She's now proposing I get $4,500 and she gets $5,500. This is an improvement from her initial offer of $4,000 for me, showing she's willing to negotiate. However, I still believe an equal split would be most fair. Since we still have several rounds remaining, I'll reject this offer and make another proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll adjust my offer to show I'm willing to compromise while still seeking a reasonably fair outcome.

{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200}

I'm proposing I receive $4,800 and Alice receives $5,200. This moves closer to Alice's last offer while still improving my position. I'm demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to find middle ground that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's latest offer.

She's now proposing I get $4,700 and she gets $5,300. This is an improvement from her previous offer of $4,500 for me. I notice we're converging â€“ her offer moved up by $200, and my last offer was $4,800 for myself. We're getting closer to agreement.

Given that we're making progress and this offer is quite reasonable, I'll accept it. Continuing to negotiate for small increments might risk us not reaching an agreement within the remaining rounds.
