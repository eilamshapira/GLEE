"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the different inflation rates we face. Since Bob's inflation rate is higher (10% vs my 5%), he might be more inclined to accept a reasonable offer now rather than wait.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because it's a fair compromise that gives Bob a substantial portion while recognizing that I'm the first mover. Given his higher inflation rate, $40 now is better for him than waiting for future rounds where the money will be worth less."
