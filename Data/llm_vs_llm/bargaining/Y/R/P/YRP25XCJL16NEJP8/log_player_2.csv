"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This is a reasonable offer considering we both need to agree, and it's better to reach a deal sooner rather than later. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I believe a 60-40 split in my favor is fair given the circumstances. Let's not drag this out too long, so we can both walk away with a substantial amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm proposing a perfectly equal 50-50 split. With the inflation affecting your gains, you should seriously consider accepting this fair offer now. Further delays will only reduce the real value of your share. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
