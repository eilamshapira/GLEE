"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll analyze this situation strategically, considering the asymmetric inflation rates that affect both Bob and me.

With each round:
- For me (Alice): Money loses 5% value
- For Bob: Money loses 20% value

Since Bob's inflation rate is much higher, he has a stronger incentive to end the game earlier. I should offer a division that's better for him than waiting, but still favorable to me.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000}

I propose I take $650,000 and Bob receives $350,000. This is a fair offer considering the inflation pressure affects Bob much more severely than me. If he rejects, the next round will already reduce his purchasing power by 20%, making even a higher portion for him potentially worth less than accepting now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Bob's offer in light of the inflation rates.

Bob has offered me $400,000 while taking $600,000 for himself. If I reject this offer:
- In the next round, my money would be worth another 5% less
- Bob's money would be worth another 20% less
- I would get to make the next offer

Let me evaluate my expected value if I reject:
- The $400,000 offered now is worth more than $400,000 * 0.95 = $380,000 in the next round
- If I make a counter-offer, Bob will face significant pressure due to his 20% inflation rate

However, I should also consider that we have many rounds left, and my inflation rate is much lower than Bob's. This gives me leverage to potentially get a better deal if I'm patient.

Given the asymmetric inflation pressure, I'll reject this offer since I can likely secure a better deal in subsequent rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now that we're in round 3, I need to consider the mounting inflation pressure on Bob while making my new offer. His money is already worth 36% less than in round 1 (after two 20% reductions), while mine is only worth about 10% less (after two 5% reductions).

Bob rejected my initial offer of 65/35, and I rejected his 40/60 split. I'll adjust my offer to be more appealing to Bob while still taking advantage of my stronger position due to the inflation differential.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose I take $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. This is a better offer for Bob than my initial proposal, and it recognizes the urgency Bob faces from his 20% per round inflation. If he rejects this, his next-round purchasing power will diminish significantly. From his perspective, $400,000 now is better than potentially getting less effective value in future rounds due to the steep inflation he faces."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Bob's new offer carefully.

Bob is now offering me $450,000, up from his previous $400,000. Let me analyze:

1) Current offer value: Bob is offering me $450,000, which at my current inflation rate (14.26% from round 1) is effectively worth about $386,330 in round 1 terms.

2) Inflation pressure: 
   - My inflation: 5% per round (relatively mild)
   - Bob's inflation: 20% per round (severe)
   - We're in round 4 of 12, so Bob's position will weaken considerably with each passing round

3) Future prospects:
   If I reject and offer $550,000 to myself in the next round, Bob would face even greater pressure with his money worth nearly 60% less than round 1.

4) Bargaining position:
   The asymmetric inflation strongly favors me as we progress through more rounds.

While Bob has improved his offer, I believe I can secure an even better deal by continuing negotiations, especially considering his rapidly deteriorating position due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now that we're in round 5, I need to recognize both the mounting pressure on Bob due to his high inflation rate and the fact that we've already gone through 4 rounds without an agreement.

Bob's money is now worth nearly 60% less than in round 1, while mine is only worth about 19% less. He's shown some willingness to negotiate by increasing his offer to me from $400,000 to $450,000.

I'll adjust my offer to find a more acceptable middle ground while still leveraging my advantageous position:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I take $550,000 and Bob receives $450,000. This is an improvement for Bob from my previous offer of $400,000, and matches what he just offered me. This should be more appealing to him given the severe inflation he faces - at 20% per round, waiting further will substantially erode his purchasing power. Even if he makes a counter-offer in the next round, the additional 20% inflation would significantly decrease the real value of whatever amount he secures."
