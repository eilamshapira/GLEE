"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer is very generous to me, allocating the entire $100 to me and nothing to herself, I should consider a fair division that would be acceptable to both of us.

Given that Alice faces a 20% depreciation in value per round while I face no depreciation, she has a stronger incentive to reach an agreement sooner. However, offering her nothing is unlikely to be accepted by a rational player.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a more balanced offer that takes into account the inflation factor that affects Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

Since Alice faces a 20% depreciation per round, I'm offering her $40 now, which is better than waiting for future rounds where her share would be worth less. This is a fair split considering the asymmetric inflation rates, giving me a reasonable portion while still providing Alice with a substantial amount that has more present value to her than waiting."
