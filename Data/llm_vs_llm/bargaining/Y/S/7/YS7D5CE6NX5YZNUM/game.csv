45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your fair starting offer. However, since the money loses 5% value for you each round but stays the same for me, I'm proposing a 55-45 split that accounts for this time preference difference. This is actually more favorable to you now than waiting for later rounds where your share would be worth less to you.",Bob,2,
45.0,55.0,"Bob, I understand your reasoning, but I believe a 55-45 split is too skewed considering we started with an equal proposal. Let's find a middle ground that's fair to both of us, considering the inflation effect.",Alice,2,reject
48.0,52.0,"Bob, considering the inflation and our previous offers, how about we settle on a 48-52 split? This way, I'm still acknowledging the time value difference, but it's closer to our initial fair split.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a more favorable split for me. However, given that we're now in round 4 and your money is worth nearly 10% less already, we should account for this time-value difference more significantly. This 58-42 split is actually fair when considering the inflation effect - if we continue negotiating, your share will be worth even less to you in future rounds. Let's reach an agreement now that acknowledges this economic reality.",Bob,4,
42.0,58.0,"Bob, I see your point about the inflation, but a 58-42 split feels too disproportionate. Let's try to find a balance that's fair to both of us, considering the time value but also the initial equal split we started with.",Alice,4,reject
45.0,55.0,"Bob, given the inflation and our previous discussions, I propose a 45-55 split. This acknowledges the time value difference but keeps us closer to a fair initial split. Let's agree on this and end the game.",Alice,5,
