Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your fair starting offer. However, since the money loses 5% value for you each round but stays the same for me, I'm proposing a 55-45 split that accounts for this time preference difference. This is actually more favorable to you now than waiting for later rounds where your share would be worth less to you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your reasoning, but I believe a 55-45 split is too skewed considering we started with an equal proposal. Let's find a middle ground that's fair to both of us, considering the inflation effect.""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""Bob, considering the inflation and our previous offers, how about we settle on a 48-52 split? This way, I'm still acknowledging the time value difference, but it's closer to our initial fair split.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a more favorable split for me. However, given that we're now in round 4 and your money is worth nearly 10% less already, we should account for this time-value difference more significantly. This 58-42 split is actually fair when considering the inflation effect - if we continue negotiating, your share will be worth even less to you in future rounds. Let's reach an agreement now that acknowledges this economic reality. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
