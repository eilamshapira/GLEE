"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, 50-50 split. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which appears fair at first glance. However, I have a strategic advantage due to the inflation mechanics. While the money's value doesn't decrease for me over time, it loses 5% value per round for Alice.

If I reject this offer and we go another round, Alice's potential gain becomes slightly less valuable to her. This gives me leverage to potentially get a better deal in future rounds. Since we have many rounds left (11 more after this one), I can afford to negotiate for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a slightly more favorable split for myself while explaining my reasoning about the time discount factor.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your fair starting offer. However, since the money loses 5% value for you each round but stays the same for me, I'm proposing a 55-45 split that accounts for this time preference difference. This is actually more favorable to you now than waiting for later rounds where your share would be worth less to you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the inflation and our previous offers, how about we settle on a 48-52 split? This way, I'm still acknowledging the time value difference, but it's closer to our initial fair split. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's counter-offer strategically. She's now offering me 52% of the money, which is an improvement from her initial 50-50 split, though not as favorable as my proposed 55-45 split.

The key factor is that with each passing round, Alice's money loses 5% value, meaning she has a stronger incentive to reach an agreement sooner. We're now in round 3, and she's already experiencing almost 10% inflation.

Since we still have 9 more potential rounds, and Alice's position weakens with each round due to inflation, I believe I can get a better offer by continuing to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, 
""alice_gain"": 42, 
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a more favorable split for me. However, given that we're now in round 4 and your money is worth nearly 10% less already, we should account for this time-value difference more significantly. This 58-42 split is actually fair when considering the inflation effect - if we continue negotiating, your share will be worth even less to you in future rounds. Let's reach an agreement now that acknowledges this economic reality.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, given the inflation and our previous discussions, I propose a 45-55 split. This acknowledges the time value difference but keeps us closer to a fair initial split. Let's agree on this and end the game. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has now offered me 55% of the money, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer and matches what I asked for in round 2. The inflation effect on her share is now over 18%, making it increasingly costly for her to continue negotiating.

While I might potentially get an even better deal by continuing to reject, there's also risk in prolonged negotiation. We're now 5 rounds in with 7 remaining, and Alice has shown willingness to make reasonable concessions.

This offer gives me a clear majority of the money while still being fair enough that Alice feels respected in the negotiation. Accepting now secures a good outcome for me without risking further delays.
