"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split while considering that inflation will reduce the value of money in future rounds. Since this is the first round and I want to increase the chances of acceptance, I'll offer a slightly favorable deal to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000}

This offer gives Bob a slight advantage ($520,000 vs $480,000) to encourage acceptance. With 5% inflation per round affecting my gains, waiting for future rounds would reduce the real value of my share, so it's in my interest to reach an agreement early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept:
   * I get $450,000 (worth 95% due to one round of inflation) = $427,500 in real value
   * Bob gets $550,000 (worth 90% due to one round of inflation) = $495,000 in real value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make a new offer
   * But my share will be worth another 5% less
   * And we risk more rounds of value destruction

While this offer gives Bob a larger nominal amount, considering the inflation effects, the real value gap isn't as large as it appears. Given that waiting will only decrease the value further for both of us, and that this is still a substantial amount in real terms, I'll accept.
