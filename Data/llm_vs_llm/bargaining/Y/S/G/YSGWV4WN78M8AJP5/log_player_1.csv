"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Given that I face a 5% inflation penalty with each passing round while Bob doesn't, I need to consider this carefully.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I believe this is a fair first offer that gives me a slight advantage while giving Bob a substantial portion. Since I'm facing inflation with each round, I need to secure a good amount early, but I want to be fair enough that Bob is likely to accept."
