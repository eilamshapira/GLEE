"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair but slightly advantageous split for myself, considering that inflation will reduce the value in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I think this is a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while maintaining a slight advantage for myself. The 55-45 split is fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting it, especially since waiting would mean the total value decreases due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Due to 20% inflation for me, if I accept this offer:
   * My $5000 is actually worth $4000 in round 1 terms
   * Bob's $5000 is worth full value to him

2. If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 3:
   * The money will be worth even less to me (another 20% drop)
   * I'm not guaranteed Bob will accept my next offer

3. This offer gives me less real value than my initial proposal would have given me ($4000 vs $5500)

However, if I reject, the next round's inflation will make any deal even worse for me. It's better to accept a somewhat unfavorable deal now than risk an even worse outcome later.
