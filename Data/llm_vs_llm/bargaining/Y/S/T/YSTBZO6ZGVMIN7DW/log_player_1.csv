"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I'll make my first offer, keeping in mind the inflation that affects me. I'll propose a fair split that also considers my advantage as the first proposer.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob has made an offer. I need to consider the inflation that has affected me. While 6000 sounds good, it's worth 10% less now.

Here's my thought process:

*   **Value to me:** $6000 * 0.9 = $5400

Bob is offering me $5400 effectively. Since I had previously proposed giving myself $5500, I will stick with my previous expectation. Therefore I will reject this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to propose again. Remember, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than in the first round (10% per round). I need to factor this in when making my offer. I'll try to make an offer that's attractive to Bob, while still securing a reasonable amount for myself, given the inflation.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offering $6500, but the inflation is really starting to bite. I need to calculate the real value to me:

*   **Value to me:** $6500 * (1 - 0.271) = $6500 * 0.729 = $4738.50

That's significantly less than the initial offers. $4738.50 is not a very good amount considering the initial 5500 i was aiming for. But with each passing round the money is devalued more. I should take this offer.

""decision"": ""accept""
