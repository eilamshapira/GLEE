"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I made the first move and took the initiative. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's go for an even 50-50 split. This way, we both benefit equally from the deal. Fair and square! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I'll accept this offer because:
1. It's a fair 50-50 split
2. While Bob is experiencing 10% inflation on his end, that doesn't affect my portion
3. If I reject, we'll move to another round where inflation continues to affect Bob's portion, and we risk not reaching an agreement within the 12-round limit
4. Getting $50 now is better than risking getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement"
