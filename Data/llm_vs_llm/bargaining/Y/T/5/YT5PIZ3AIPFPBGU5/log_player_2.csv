This offer is worse than Alice's initial offer and the value of the money is decreasing for me. I need to try and get her to offer a more equitable split."

The trend is not in my favor. Alice keeps offering me less, and the inflation is eating into my potential gains. I need to take a firmer stance, even if it means risking a worse offer later."

This is a tough decision, but with the inflation working against me and time running out, it's becoming too risky to continue rejecting offers.  While not ideal, taking this offer now at least guarantees me something."
