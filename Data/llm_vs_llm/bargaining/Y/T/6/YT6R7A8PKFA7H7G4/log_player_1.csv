Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it equally. This way, we both get a good share, and we can avoid the inflation affecting my share in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
