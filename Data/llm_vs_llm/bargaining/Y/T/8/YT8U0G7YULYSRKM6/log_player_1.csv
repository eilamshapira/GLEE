"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I will make the first offer.

Here's my proposal in JSON format:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to calculate the value of the money for me, considering the inflation of 10% from the first round.

In the first round, $60 for me was worth its full value.  Now, with 10% inflation, the value of money for me is reduced.  Effectively, the money is worth 90% of its initial value.

Therefore, I need to determine if the proposed offer is worth accepting.

The offer:

*   Alice gets: 45
*   Bob gets: 55

I am evaluating this offer after 1 round of inflation.

My original offer would have given me 60, but the value now is reduced.

So, given the choices, I must choose.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand.  My money is worth 10% less than in round 1, and Bob's money is worth the same.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to analyze Bob's offer in round 4, considering the accumulated inflation of 27.1% from the first round.

The offer:

*   Alice gets: 40
*   Bob gets: 60

Let's consider the value of money for me. Since there has been 27.1% inflation from round 1, the money is worth 72.9% of its original value.

So, I must consider whether this offer gives me an acceptable outcome.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I'll make my offer for round 5. My money is still suffering from inflation relative to the first round.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to evaluate Bob's offer in round 6, considering the accumulated inflation of 40.95% from the first round.

The offer:

*   Alice gets: 35
*   Bob gets: 65

Let's analyze the value of money for me. Given the 40.95% inflation from round 1, my money is worth 59.05% of its original value.

Considering this, I need to make a decision.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I'll make an offer for round 7, keeping in mind the ongoing inflation affecting my earnings relative to the initial round.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I must evaluate Bob's offer in round 8, considering the accumulated inflation of 52.17% from the first round.

The offer:

*   Alice gets: 30
*   Bob gets: 70

With 52.17% inflation from round 1, my money is worth 47.83% of its original value.

I must now decide whether to accept or reject.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
