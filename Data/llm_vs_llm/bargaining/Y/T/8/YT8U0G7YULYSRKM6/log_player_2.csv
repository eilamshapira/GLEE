"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice offered me $40, keeping $60 for herself. Since the money doesn't lose value for me over rounds, but loses 10% value per round for Alice, I have some leverage here. If I reject, Alice will get less value in future rounds, while my value stays constant.

I can likely negotiate a better deal, as Alice has more incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later due to the depreciation factor affecting her.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's money loses 10% value each round and she made a somewhat unfair first offer, I'll propose a more balanced split that gives me a slight advantage but is still reasonable enough that she might accept it to avoid further value loss.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose this split to be fair while accounting for my stronger negotiating position due to the inflation only affecting Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice has moved from her initial 40/60 split to a 45/55 split
2. For Alice, the $55 is now worth only about $44.55 (due to 19% inflation)
3. We still have 9 rounds left
4. Each additional round will decrease Alice's value by another 10%
5. My $45 maintains its full value

While this is better than her first offer, I believe I can still get a better deal. The inflation pressure on Alice's side gives me a stronger negotiating position, and we have plenty of rounds left.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice has shown movement from 60/40 to 55/45, and considering that her money is now worth significantly less due to inflation, I'll make a stronger offer but not too aggressive to keep negotiations productive.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because:
1. For Alice, $40 now is better than a larger amount later due to continuing inflation
2. It's a reasonable progression from previous offers
3. It reflects my stronger negotiating position due to inflation only affecting Alice"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this:
1. Alice has moved to an even 50/50 split
2. Due to 34.39% inflation, Alice's $50 is actually worth only about $32.80 to her
3. My $50 maintains full value
4. We still have 7 rounds left
5. Each additional round will decrease Alice's value by another 10%

While Alice is moving in my direction and offering an apparently ""fair"" split, the inflation factor means she's still getting significantly less real value. Given that we have several rounds left and the inflation pressure continues to work in my favor, I believe I can still achieve a better outcome.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Alice has moved to a 50/50 split, and her value keeps decreasing (her $50 was worth only $32.80 to her in the last round), I'll increase my offer to reflect my even stronger position. However, I need to be careful not to be too aggressive and risk multiple further rejections.

{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}

I propose this split because:
1. The declining value for Alice means she should be more motivated to accept soon
2. $35 now for Alice is actually worth more to her than a larger amount in later rounds
3. We still have several rounds, but the inflation risk for Alice is becoming more significant
4. This is a natural progression from my previous offer of 60/40"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation carefully:

1. Alice is offering me $52, slightly better than her last offer
2. Her $48 is worth only about $25.51 to her due to 46.86% inflation
3. We have 5 rounds left
4. Each further round will decrease Alice's value by another 10%
5. My $52 maintains full value

While Alice continues to move in my direction, the severe inflation impact means she's getting a much worse deal with each passing round. Given that we still have 5 rounds left and the inflation pressure is becoming quite severe for Alice, I believe I can still achieve a better outcome.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","The inflation impact is becoming very severe for Alice now. Her last $48 was worth only about $25.51 to her, and it will get worse each round. I need to make an offer that's strong enough to reflect my advantage but not so aggressive that she'll definitely reject it, as we don't want to risk running out of rounds.

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}

I propose this split because:
1. $30 now for Alice is actually worth more to her than larger amounts in later rounds due to the severe inflation (46.86% and growing)
2. We're entering the final third of our rounds, increasing pressure to reach a deal
3. Alice has shown willingness to move from her initial position
4. This reflects the significant advantage I have due to inflation only affecting Alice
5. It's a logical progression from my previous offer of 65/35"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this critical situation:

1. Alice is offering me $55
2. Her $45 is worth only about $19.37 to her due to 56.95% inflation
3. We only have 3 rounds left
4. Each further round will decrease Alice's value by another 10%
5. My $55 maintains full value

While normally I might reject this to push for more, we're in a dangerous position:
1. Only 3 rounds remain
2. If we don't reach agreement in 12 rounds, we both get nothing
3. The last few exchanges show we're having trouble finding agreement
4. $55 is a decent outcome for me, considering we started at $40

Given the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds, and that I've achieved a significant improvement from the initial offer, I think it's prudent to accept now.
