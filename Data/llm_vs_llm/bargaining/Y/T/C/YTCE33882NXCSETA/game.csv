8000.0,2000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a division where I get $8000 and you get $2000. This is a good deal for you, considering the rounds left. Let's end this now!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, considering the inflation rate is higher for you, I think this is a fair deal. The sooner we agree, the better for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, I understand inflation is affecting us differently. However, I'm proposing a slightly more balanced split this time: $6000 for me, $4000 for you. Let's try to wrap this up before we both lose too much value!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, the longer we wait, the more you lose. I'm willing to take a bit more to compensate for the smaller impact of inflation on me. This is a reasonable offer, considering the circumstances.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's try again. I'm offering $5500 for myself and $4500 for you. We are getting deeper into the game, and even small gains start mattering a lot. I believe this is a fair offer.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, at this point, every round is costing you significantly more than me. I'm willing to take a larger share, but I'm still offering you a substantial amount. It's time to be realistic about the impact of inflation on our gains.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, I propose a 50/50 split: $5000 for me, $5000 for you. It might seem a little late to split it evenly but at this point, we are losing a lot, so it might be better to secure half of it each.",Alice,7,
