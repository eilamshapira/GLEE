Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the information about inflation, and the current offer:

My money is now worth less. While I can't directly calculate Bob's inflation, I know that his offer is significantly more beneficial for him, and my initial offer was rejected.

Therefore, I will reject this offer.
