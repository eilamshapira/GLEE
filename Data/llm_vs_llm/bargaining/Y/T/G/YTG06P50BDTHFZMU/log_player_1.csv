"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation affecting your share, I propose a 55/45 split. It's a fair adjustment given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my effective gain would be 20% less, so the $4500 I'd receive would be worth $3600 to me.

Given this, I think Bob's offer is still not in my favor. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Due to the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% * 2 = 40% less than in the first round (20% less in Round 2 and another 20% less in Round 3, compounded). 

To calculate my effective gain, I'll consider the inflation. If I were to receive $x, its effective value to me would be $x * 0.6 (since 40% less is the same as 60% of the original value).

With that in mind, here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, considering the inflation affecting my share.""
}
```"
