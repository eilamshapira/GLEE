"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the inflation risk. This offer gives you a substantial amount while ensuring we both get a good deal early on. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Alice is offering me $4,500 out of $10,000. While it's not a 50-50 split, there are several factors to consider:

1. If I reject, the next round will have 5% inflation, meaning the total value for me would be worth only $9,500
2. To exceed $4,500 in the next round, I would need to:
   - Make a proposal that Alice accepts
   - Get more than $4,737 ($4,500 / 0.95) to account for inflation
3. Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to more rounds and more value loss
4. We only have 12 rounds, and delays risk getting nothing

Getting $4,500 immediately is a reasonable offer, considering the inflation risk and the uncertainty of future negotiations.
