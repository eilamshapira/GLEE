"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}

I suggest this division as it's close to equal but gives me a small advantage as the first mover. It's fair enough that Bob should seriously consider accepting rather than moving to the next round where the total amount will be reduced by 5%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I reject, we go to round 3 where the money will be worth another 5% less
2. Bob's offer is essentially the reverse of my initial offer
3. My $4800 in this round is worth $4560 due to the 5% inflation
4. If I reject and make a new offer, there's no guarantee Bob will accept, and we'll lose more value

Given these factors, I'll accept the offer. While it's slightly less favorable than my initial proposal, the risk of further depreciation makes this a reasonable deal.
