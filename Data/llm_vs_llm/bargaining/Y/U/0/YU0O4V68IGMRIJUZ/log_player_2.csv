"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer. I would get $40, and Alice would get $60. Since it's the first round, the money hasn't lost value yet. I need to consider the effect of inflation in later rounds if I reject this. If I reject, Alice gets to propose next round, and I'll be subject to her possible greed and the inflation. $40 seems like a fair starting point considering the potential risks.
