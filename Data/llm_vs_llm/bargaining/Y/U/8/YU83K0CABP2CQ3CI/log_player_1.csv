"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to be mindful of the inflation effect on my potential gains. Since I'm making the first offer, I should aim for a favorable split, but not so greedy that Bob rejects it outright. I'll try to secure a good portion for myself while leaving enough for Bob to make it worthwhile for him to accept.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob has proposed a 50/50 split. This is more generous than my initial offer. However, I need to consider the inflation affecting my potential gains. Accepting 50 now means I'm getting the equivalent of 45 from the initial round (50 * 0.9 = 45). Since I started by asking for 60, this is quite a drop. Let's see if I can get a better deal.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Alright, now it's my turn again. I rejected the 50/50 split because of inflation. I need to offer Bob enough to make him accept, but also account for the fact that my gains are being eroded. Let's try a slightly more generous offer to Bob than my initial one, factoring in that I need to get more to compensate for inflation.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is now 45 for me and 55 for him. The inflation is hitting me hard now at 27.1% less than the first round. Accepting 45 means I'm effectively getting 45 * (1 - 0.271) = 45 * 0.729 = 32.805 relative to the first round. That's quite a significant drop. However, the rounds are dwindling, and if we reach round 12 without agreement, we both get nothing. I'm going to try to get a better deal.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I rejected Bob's 45/55 offer. Inflation is becoming a serious problem. I need to make an offer that Bob finds palatable, but also gives me enough to make it worthwhile, considering the decreasing value. I will offer him slightly more, hoping he accepts to stop the inflation from eating away all of my potential earnings.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48
}
```"
