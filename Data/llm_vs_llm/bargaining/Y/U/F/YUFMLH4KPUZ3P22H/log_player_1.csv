"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 45-55 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair compromise given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

Bob is offering me $5,500, which is worth $5,500 to me (no inflation penalty).
If I reject and we go to the next round:
- I could offer again, but Bob would face another 5% inflation penalty
- Bob might reject again, leading to further rounds
- My bargaining position gets stronger with each round due to Bob's inflation penalty

However, $5,500 is a decent offer - it's more than 50% of the total. While I might get more by rejecting and continuing, there's also a risk of prolonging negotiations unnecessarily.
