"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. If I reject this offer:
1. I'll get to make a counter-offer next round
2. However, due to 5% inflation, the money will be worth less to me
3. There's no guarantee Alice will accept my counter-offer
4. A 50-50 split is traditionally considered fair

Current offer: $500,000
After inflation (next round): $475,000

Since this is a fair first offer and any delay will cost me money due to inflation, I should accept.
