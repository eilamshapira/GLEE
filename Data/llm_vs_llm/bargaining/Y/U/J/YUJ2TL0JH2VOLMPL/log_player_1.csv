This is still a bad deal for me, even considering the inflation. I need to aim for a much larger share in the coming rounds to make it worthwhile."

# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough one, but I have to reject. Accepting this offer would mean getting a tiny fraction of the initial value.  I'm banking on Bob cracking under pressure in the next round."

I'm offering slightly more than what Bob offered me, recognizing the time pressure.  It's a risk, but I need to incentivize him to settle now."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a brutally low offer, but I'm backed into a corner. Accepting is a last resort to salvage something from this deal. If I reject, I risk getting nothing at all."
