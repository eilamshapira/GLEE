Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that waiting reduces the value for you by 20%, this offer of $450000 now is actually worth more to you than $600000 in the next round would be. This is a fair deal that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
