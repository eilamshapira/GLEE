"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, considering my contribution to the game. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
3. Alice's money will be worth 20% less in the next round (her $600,000 would effectively become worth $480,000 to her)
4. My money doesn't lose value between rounds
5. This gives me negotiating leverage - I can offer her a better nominal amount in the next round that's actually worth less to her

Given these factors, I should reject this offer. I can propose a more favorable split in the next round, and Alice will be more likely to accept due to the 20% devaluation she faces.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer considering that Alice faces 20% devaluation per round:

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Given that waiting reduces the value for you by 20%, this offer of $450,000 now is actually worth more to you than $600,000 in the next round would be. This is a fair deal that benefits us both.""}

The reasoning behind my offer:
1. If Alice rejects this, her next round money will be worth 20% less
2. $450,000 now is worth more to her than $600,000 in the next round (which would be worth $480,000 to her)
3. This makes it rational for her to accept
4. I improve my position from the original offer while still giving Alice a reasonable amount"
