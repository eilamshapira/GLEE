"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I will make a fair offer to start with. I'll propose a split that gives me a slight advantage, accounting for potential inflation in later rounds.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","That's not a great offer, considering the inflation impacting my potential gains. However, rejecting it means further inflation and risk of reaching the 12-round limit. I'll reject this and hope to get a better offer next round when it's my turn again.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, now it's my turn again. Inflation is eating away at my potential gains, so I need to be more aggressive but still reasonable enough that Bob accepts. Let's see if this works:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split isn't terrible, and the inflation is starting to bite. While I'd ideally want more, the risk of further inflation and potentially losing everything is weighing on me. Considering the circumstances, I'll accept this offer.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
