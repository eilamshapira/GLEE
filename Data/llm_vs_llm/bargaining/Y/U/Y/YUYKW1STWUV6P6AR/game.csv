55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher share for myself since inflation affects me by 5% each round while it doesn't affect you. This way we can finish the game now and both walk away with a good amount.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Okay Alice, I see your point about inflation. Let's make it a bit fairer. I'll take a slightly larger share to compensate for the lost value, but we'll still both get a good amount. What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"Bob, considering the 5% inflation that affects me each round, I need to protect my value. I'm now losing 10% of my money's value compared to round 1. This offer accounts for that disadvantage while still giving you a substantial portion. Let's avoid further rounds of inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"Alice, I'm willing to be flexible, but your offers are becoming increasingly skewed. Let's find a balance. I'll increase your share slightly, but this is the best I can do to avoid further losses for both of us. What do you think?",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, after 5 rounds, I'm now facing a 19% inflation penalty compared to round 1. Each time we reject each other's offers, my position worsens while yours remains the same. This 60/40 split compensates for my disadvantage. Let's conclude this now before further inflation affects both our payouts.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alright Alice, let's try this one more time. I understand the inflation is hitting you hard, but I think this split offers a good compromise. Let's not risk getting nothing. What do you say?",Bob,6,
