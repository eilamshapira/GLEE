"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher share for myself since inflation affects me by 5% each round while it doesn't affect you. This way we can finish the game now and both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the 5% inflation that affects me each round, I need to protect my value. I'm now losing 10% of my money's value compared to round 1. This offer accounts for that disadvantage while still giving you a substantial portion. Let's avoid further rounds of inflation.

# Alice gain: 58

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, after 5 rounds, I'm now facing a 19% inflation penalty compared to round 1. Each time we reject each other's offers, my position worsens while yours remains the same. This 60/40 split compensates for my disadvantage. Let's conclude this now before further inflation affects both our payouts.

# Alice gain: 60
