5500.0,4500.0,Let's start with a fair split. This offer accounts for your slightly lower inflation rate.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, as the rounds progress, delays cost us both, but especially you given the faster depreciation. I’m proposing a 6000/4000 split that reflects our respective inflation rates. Accepting now secures a better outcome for you than risking further devaluation. What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, I understand the inflation pressure, but 60/40 is too skewed. Let's meet in the middle. This offer gives you a bit more to reflect your inflation advantage but still gives me a reasonable share.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5300.0,4700.0,"Alice, as we move into Round 4, the pressure of inflation increases—your future share will devalue at 27% compared to Round 1 while mine lose around 14%. With you as the next proposer if we continue, you'll face even steeper depreciation. I’m proposing a 4700/5300 split which gives you a solid nominal share while securing a bit of my inflation advantage. This deal ensures you receive a higher effective value than if you waited another round. I believe this strike is fair given our differing devaluation rates; I hope you'll agree to it.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5100.0,4900.0,"Bob, I'm rejecting that offer. Inflation is hurting us both, but I think we can find a fairer middle ground. How about 5100 for me and 4900 for you? It acknowledges your lower inflation rate, but still gives me a decent amount considering.",Alice,5,
