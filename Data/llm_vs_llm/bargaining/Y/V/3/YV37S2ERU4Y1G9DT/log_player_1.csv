Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as the rounds progress, delays cost us both, but especially you given the faster depreciation. I’m proposing a 6000/4000 split that reflects our respective inflation rates. Accepting now secures a better outcome for you than risking further devaluation. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

  ""bob_gain"": 4800,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, as we move into Round 4, the pressure of inflation increases—your future share will devalue at 27% compared to Round 1 while mine lose around 14%. With you as the next proposer if we continue, you'll face even steeper depreciation. I’m proposing a 4700/5300 split which gives you a solid nominal share while securing a bit of my inflation advantage. This deal ensures you receive a higher effective value than if you waited another round. I believe this strike is fair given our differing devaluation rates; I hope you'll agree to it. 
# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700
