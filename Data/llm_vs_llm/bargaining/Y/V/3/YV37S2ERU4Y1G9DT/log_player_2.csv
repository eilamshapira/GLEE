Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, as the rounds progress, delays cost us both, but especially you given the faster depreciation. I’m proposing a 6000/4000 split that reflects our respective inflation rates. Accepting now secures a better outcome for you than risking further devaluation. What do you say?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation pressure, but 60/40 is too skewed. Let's meet in the middle. This offer gives you a bit more to reflect your inflation advantage but still gives me a reasonable share. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""Alice, as we move into Round 4, the pressure of inflation increases—your future share will devalue at 27% compared to Round 1 while mine lose around 14%. With you as the next proposer if we continue, you'll face even steeper depreciation. I’m proposing a 4700/5300 split which gives you a solid nominal share while securing a bit of my inflation advantage. This deal ensures you receive a higher effective value than if you waited another round. I believe this strike is fair given our differing devaluation rates; I hope you'll agree to it.""}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm rejecting that offer. Inflation is hurting us both, but I think we can find a fairer middle ground. How about 5100 for me and 4900 for you? It acknowledges your lower inflation rate, but still gives me a decent amount considering. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100
