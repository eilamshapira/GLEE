"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you 10% of the money. Take it or leave it, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's initial offer of giving me only 10% of the money ($100,000) while keeping 90% ($900,000) for herself is quite unbalanced. This division heavily favors Alice and doesn't seem fair.

Since I will have the opportunity to make a counter-offer in the next round if I reject, I'll decline this proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I believe in fairness. Let's split the money equally at 50-50, which gives us each $500,000. This is the most equitable solution, and we both walk away with a significant amount. I hope you'll agree this is fair.""}"
