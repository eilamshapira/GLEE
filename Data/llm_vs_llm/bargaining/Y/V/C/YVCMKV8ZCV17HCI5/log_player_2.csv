"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice has proposed a 50-50 split, which is quite fair, I need to consider if this is optimal for me given the inflation mechanic.

If I reject, in the next round I'll make an offer, but the money will be worth 20% less to me. This means the $100 would effectively be worth $80 to me. Even if I proposed a more favorable split for myself in round 2, the overall value has already decreased.

Since this is the first round with no inflation yet applied, and I'm being offered half of the full value, this is likely the best outcome I can achieve.
