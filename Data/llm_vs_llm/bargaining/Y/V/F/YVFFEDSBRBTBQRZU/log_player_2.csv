"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly! I'm offering you a generous sum to avoid the risk of losing everything. Take this deal! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a lowball offer from Alice. She's offering me only 10% of the total, while keeping 90% for herself, and she's trying to pressure me into accepting quickly to avoid inflation.

Given that I have the option to make a counteroffer and the inflation is only 5% per round, I can afford to negotiate for a better deal. Even with one round of inflation, I'd still come out ahead with a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a much more equitable offer that acknowledges the time pressure we both face.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us, and we should agree quickly to minimize the effects of inflation. If we keep negotiating, we both lose value with each round.""}"
