"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis that takes into account that with every new round the money “depreciates” by 10% for you (Alice) and 5% for Bob, one arrives (approximately) at the following reasoning:

• In round 12 (the final round) Bob—who would be making the proposal then—could offer you almost nothing while keeping nearly 100% of $10,000. (Because if you reject you get nothing, you’d accept, however small the amount.)

• Then working backward, in round 11 when you would be the proposer you must offer Bob just enough so that his “discounted” gain is no worse than what he’d guarantee himself in round 12. (It turns out that in round 11 an equilibrium proposal would be to give Bob nominally $9,500 and you keep $500.)

• Continuing this process, in each preceding round the proposer must offer the responder exactly the “discounted continuation value” that the responder would obtain by waiting for his/her turn as proposer. For example, when Bob would be proposing in round 10 he could offer you a nominal $450 (so that after you discount by 10% for that round you are indifferent to waiting for round 11’s offer).

• Working all the way back to round 1 (where you propose) the calculation shows that you can “keep” a nominal amount of about $2,099.18 and offer Bob about $7,900.82. In round 1 there is no discount yet (i.e. the full $10,000 is “fresh”), but Bob’s alternative if he rejects is his equilibrium prospect in round 2. In round 2 Bob would be able to secure (after his 5% discount for waiting one round) an actual value of about 0.95 × $8,314.55 ≈ $7,900.82. To make Bob indifferent (and hence make the proposal just acceptable) your offer in round 1 should give him at least $7,900.82.

Thus, an equilibrium offer (to two‐decimal accuracy) for round 1 is:

{""alice_gain"": 2099.18, ""bob_gain"": 7900.82}

You may now present this offer as Alice for round 1."
