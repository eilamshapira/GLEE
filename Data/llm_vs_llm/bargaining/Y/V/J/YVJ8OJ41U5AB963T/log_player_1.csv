"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the different inflation rates we face. Since my money loses value faster (20% vs 10% per round), I should ask for a bit more to compensate.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it's fair but accounts for my higher inflation rate. Bob should find this reasonable since he still gets a substantial amount, and waiting would reduce the value for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

My $500,000 is now worth only 80% of what it was worth in round 1, so effectively $400,000 in round 1 terms.
Bob's $500,000 is worth 90% of round 1 value, so $450,000 in round 1 terms.

This is worse than my initial offer, and waiting another round will decrease the value even more due to inflation. However, if I reject, my next offer would be worth even less due to the compounding inflation rates.
