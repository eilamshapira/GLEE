"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer.

Alice is offering that I (Bob) get all the money ($10,000), while she gets nothing ($0). This is extremely favorable to me, and I would be getting the maximum possible amount.

While this might seem strange, I should accept this highly favorable offer rather than risk a worse deal in future rounds.
