"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing to take 60% of the money, leaving me with 40% ($4000). While this isn't an equal split, it's not terribly unfair. However, I believe I could negotiate for a better deal in the next round.

If I reject, I'll have the opportunity to make a counter-proposal, and Alice will likely consider a more balanced offer to avoid further delays. The risk of rejection is relatively low with a fair counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still giving Alice a small advantage to increase the likelihood of acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200}

This offer is more balanced than Alice's initial proposal, moving from a 60-40 split to a more reasonable 52-48 split in Alice's favor. It shows I'm willing to be fair while still giving Alice a slight advantage, which should make the offer more appealing to accept."
