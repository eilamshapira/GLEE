"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $4,000 while she takes $6,000. While this isn't an even split, it's still a substantial amount. Given that:

1. I know I'm not affected by inflation in future rounds
2. I could make a counter-offer in the next round
3. We still have 11 rounds left
4. However, there's no guarantee Alice would accept a more favorable offer

I think I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but not completely equal to show some willingness to compromise. Since Alice opened with a 40/60 split in her favor, I'll propose a 55/45 split in my favor, which is less aggressive than simply reversing her proposal.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This offer is more balanced than Alice's initial proposal while still giving me a slight advantage as the proposer. It shows I'm willing to be reasonable while still seeking a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased her offer to me from $4,000 to $4,500
2. She's now asking for $5,500 (down from $6,000)
3. Importantly, I now know that Alice is affected by inflation - her gains are worth 36% less than in round 1
4. For Alice, $5,500 is now actually worth only $3,520 (after 36% inflation)
5. My $4,500 would still be worth the full amount since I'm not affected by inflation
6. This makes this offer actually quite favorable for me in real terms

Given these factors, especially that I would get $4,500 at full value while Alice's portion is significantly devalued by inflation, this is a good deal for me. I should accept before the deal potentially gets worse.
