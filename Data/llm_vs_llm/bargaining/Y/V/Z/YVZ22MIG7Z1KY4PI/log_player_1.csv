"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair offer to start with, considering the 5% inflation penalty per round for me.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

This is a 50-50 split that gives us both equal amounts. I think this is a fair division that respects both of our interests, and there's no need to go into further rounds where the total value would decrease for me due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I see that we both experienced inflation, but Bob's inflation rate is higher than mine. Let me offer a split that considers this dynamic.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm offering you a bit more than I'd take, recognizing that we both face inflation penalties with each round. This is a fair compromise that gives you the majority while still being reasonable for me. Let's conclude this negotiation and both walk away with a good outcome before further inflation reduces our total value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4300 
# Bob gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
