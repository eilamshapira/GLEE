"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 23.57, ""bob_gain"": 76.43, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – here's my proposal for round 1. In our 12‐round bargaining game where each round sees a 5% drop in the total value, I've worked through the backward–induction logic. If we both act rationally, my equilibrium offer gives you about $76.43 and me about $23.57 in today’s dollars. Accepting now is best for both of us since waiting reduces the pie further. What do you say?""}"
