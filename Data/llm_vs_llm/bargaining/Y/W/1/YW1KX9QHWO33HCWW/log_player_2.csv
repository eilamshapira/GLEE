"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – here's my proposal for round 1. In our 12‐round bargaining game where each round sees a 5% drop in the total value, I've worked through the backward–induction logic. If we both act rationally, my equilibrium offer gives you about $76.43 and me about $23.57 in today’s dollars. Accepting now is best for both of us since waiting reduces the pie further. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 76.43 
# Alice gain: 23.57 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $76.43 for me and $23.57 for her.

This seems quite generous to me. Alice is offering me over 76% of the money, which is much more than an even split. She's mentioned something about backward induction and equilibrium, suggesting she's calculated an optimal solution based on the game theory.

With the 5% inflation penalty per round, the total value decreases over time, so there's an incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Getting more than 3/4 of the money in the first round is an excellent outcome for me.
