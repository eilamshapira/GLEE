"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split considering our different inflation rates. If we go to another round, the money will be worth less for both of us, but especially for me. This split gives us both substantial value without risking further depreciation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current split: $450,000 for me, $550,000 for Alice
2. If I reject:
   * Next round the money will be worth 5% less for me
   * Worth 20% less for Alice
   * I can make a counter-offer
3. Alice's reasoning about inflation is valid
4. The split is relatively fair (45/55)
5. The absolute amounts are substantial

Given that Alice would lose significantly more value (20%) in the next round compared to my 5% loss, I could potentially negotiate a better deal. However, this is already a reasonable offer, and the risk of continued negotiation might not be worth the potential gain.
