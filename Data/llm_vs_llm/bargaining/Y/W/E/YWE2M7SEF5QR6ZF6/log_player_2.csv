"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both benefit equally without risking value loss from inflation in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this is the best deal for me considering the inflation effect. If I reject and make a counter-offer, the total value will be 5% less for me in the next round.

If I accept now, I get $50.
If I reject and propose in the next round, I'd need to get more than $50/0.95 = $52.63 to come out ahead.

This seems like a fair initial offer, especially considering the inflation risk for me.
