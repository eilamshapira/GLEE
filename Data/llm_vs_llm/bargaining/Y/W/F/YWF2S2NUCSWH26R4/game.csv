60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair because if we go to the next round, I'll face a 20% inflation penalty while you won't. So if you reject and offer me 50/50 next round, I'd only effectively get 40 due to inflation. This deal is better for both of us than going to another round.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. Since you face 20% inflation per round and I don't, this actually gives you $45 now which is worth more than $50 in a future round would be to you (as that would only be worth $40 to you after inflation). This is better than continuing to another round where you'd face additional inflation penalties. This offer is fair and beneficial for both of us.",Bob,2,
