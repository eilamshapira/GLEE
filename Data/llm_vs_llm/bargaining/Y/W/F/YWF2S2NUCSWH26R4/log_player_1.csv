"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that takes into account the 20% inflation penalty I face with each passing round.

{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair because if we go to the next round, I'll face a 20% inflation penalty while you won't. So if you reject and offer me 50/50 next round, I'd only effectively get 40 due to inflation. This deal is better for both of us than going to another round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. Since you face 20% inflation per round and I don't, this actually gives you $45 now which is worth more than $50 in a future round would be to you (as that would only be worth $40 to you after inflation). This is better than continuing to another round where you'd face additional inflation penalties. This offer is fair and beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
