"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair because if we go to the next round, I'll face a 20% inflation penalty while you won't. So if you reject and offer me 50/50 next round, I'd only effectively get 40 due to inflation. This deal is better for both of us than going to another round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's offer and reasoning.

Alice is offering me $40 while she takes $60. Her argument is based on the inflation penalty she faces (20% per round) while I face no inflation (0%). 

Let me analyze this: If I reject and we go to the next round, I could offer a 50/50 split ($50 each). For Alice, her $50 would be worth 20% less due to inflation, making it effectively worth $40 to her. So Alice would be no better off by waiting.

However, I would gain an additional $10 by waiting and proposing in the next round (getting $50 instead of the current $40 offer). Since I face no inflation penalty, my money doesn't lose value between rounds.

Therefore, rejecting this offer and making my own proposal next round would be more advantageous for me.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair offer that acknowledges the inflation dynamics while improving my position.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. Since you face 20% inflation per round and I don't, this actually gives you $45 now which is worth more than $50 in a future round would be to you (as that would only be worth $40 to you after inflation). This is better than continuing to another round where you'd face additional inflation penalties. This offer is fair and beneficial for both of us.""}"
