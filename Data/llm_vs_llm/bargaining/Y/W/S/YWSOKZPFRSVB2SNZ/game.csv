600000.0,400000.0,Let's be fair and split it 60-40 in my favor to account for inflation.,Alice,1,

550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, I know we both want to reach an agreement quickly. Given that waiting further will reduce my share’s real value due to inflation, I propose a split of $450000 for me and $550000 for you. I believe this is fair and efficient—it avoids further delay and any additional losses. What do you think?",Bob,2,

560000.0,440000.0,"Alice, I understand the challenges inflation poses for both of us. Waiting further only erodes our gains—especially mine—and I’m keen to avoid that loss. To that end, I propose a division of $440000 for me and $560000 for you. This adjusted split reflects the cost of delay while still offering you an attractive share. I believe settling now is in both our best interests—let’s put an end to this erosion and agree today.",Bob,4,
