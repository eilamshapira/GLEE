Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know we both want to reach an agreement quickly. Given that waiting further will reduce my share’s real value due to inflation, I propose a split of $450000 for me and $550000 for you. I believe this is fair and efficient—it avoids further delay and any additional losses. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the challenges inflation poses for both of us. Waiting further only erodes our gains—especially mine—and I’m keen to avoid that loss. To that end, I propose a division of $440000 for me and $560000 for you. This adjusted split reflects the cost of delay while still offering you an attractive share. I believe settling now is in both our best interests—let’s put an end to this erosion and agree today. 
# Alice gain: 560000 
# Bob gain: 440000
