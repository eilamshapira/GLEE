Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the value of the money is decreasing for you, so it's in your best interest to accept this offer now and get $40, rather than risking getting even less later. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
