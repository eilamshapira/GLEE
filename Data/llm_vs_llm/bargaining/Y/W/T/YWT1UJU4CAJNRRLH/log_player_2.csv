"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a fair split. I'm offering you $45, a good deal considering the shrinking value for me over time. Let's take this now! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer is not very favorable to me, and considering the money will be worth less to Alice over time, I think I can get a better deal if I wait.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Now it's my turn to make an offer. Considering the money is worth 10% less to Alice after each round, I'll try to take advantage of that.

{""bob_gain"": 60, 
""alice_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Alice, the value of the money is decreasing for you, so it's in your best interest to accept this offer now and get $40, rather than risking getting even less later.""}"
