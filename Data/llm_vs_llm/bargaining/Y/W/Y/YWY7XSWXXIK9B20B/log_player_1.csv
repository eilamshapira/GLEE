"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose we divide the million dollars by assigning $600,000 to me and $400,000 to you. I believe this offer is a strong starting point, and considering the game’s rounds and potential inflation effects, it’s in both our interests to settle early. Looking forward to your thoughts.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your proposal. While your offer is reasonable, I believe a slightly more balanced split would be fairer considering the potential for inflation to impact our gains. How about we try $550000 for me and $450000 for you? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
