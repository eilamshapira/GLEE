"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we divide the million dollars by assigning $600000 to me and $400000 to you. I believe this offer is a strong starting point, and considering the game’s rounds and potential inflation effects, it’s in both our interests to settle early. Looking forward to your thoughts. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
