"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a fair split! I propose 55 for me, 45 for you. It's a good starting point and we avoid inflation eating into our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $45 out of $100
2. While not a 50-50 split, it's relatively close
3. If I reject, the next round will have the money worth 20% less (only $80 total)
4. Even if I counter with a better offer next round, Alice might reject, leading to further losses

Given that a fair split would be $50 each, and rejecting would mean dealing with a smaller total amount, I'll accept this offer. The $45 I get now is better than risking further negotiations with diminishing value.
