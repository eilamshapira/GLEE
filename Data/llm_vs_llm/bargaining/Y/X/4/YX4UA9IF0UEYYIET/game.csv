,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, thank you for your offer. Given the time sensitivity of the game, I'd like to propose a counteroffer: I receive $5500 and you get $4500. This slight advantage for me reflects the role reversal as the proposer, and I believe itâ€™s a fair resolution that protects both our interests. What do you say?",Bob,2,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, inflation is hitting us. I'm lowering my ask slightly. How about this split?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, I appreciate your concerns about inflation, and I know time is of the essence. Since further rounds might decrease the value of any future offers on your side even more, I'm proposing that I receive $5200 and you receive $4800. This offer secures a fair outcome for both of us immediately without further delay. I hope you agree that concluding our negotiations now is in our mutual best interest.",Bob,4,
