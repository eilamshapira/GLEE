Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. Given the time sensitivity of the game, I'd like to propose a counteroffer: I receive $5500 and you get $4500. This slight advantage for me reflects the role reversal as the proposer, and I believe itâ€™s a fair resolution that protects both our interests. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your concerns about inflation, and I know time is of the essence. Since further rounds might decrease the value of any future offers on your side even more, I'm proposing that I receive $5200 and you receive $4800. This offer secures a fair outcome for both of us immediately without further delay. I hope you agree that concluding our negotiations now is in our mutual best interest.
