Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. Given the time sensitivity of the game, I'd like to propose a counteroffer: I receive $5500 and you get $4500. This slight advantage for me reflects the role reversal as the proposer, and I believe itâ€™s a fair resolution that protects both our interests. What do you say?""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is hitting us. I'm lowering my ask slightly. How about this split? 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your concerns about inflation, and I know time is of the essence. Since further rounds might decrease the value of any future offers on your side even more, I'm proposing that I receive $5200 and you receive $4800. This offer secures a fair outcome for both of us immediately without further delay. I hope you agree that concluding our negotiations now is in our mutual best interest.""}"
