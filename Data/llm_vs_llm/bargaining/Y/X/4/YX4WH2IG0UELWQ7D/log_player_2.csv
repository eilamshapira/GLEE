Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more. Let's settle for this split to ensure we both get a fair share while considering the inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving slightly in my direction, the offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. It's important to demonstrate I'm willing to play tough and that a more equitable split is necessary.  The impact of inflation is becoming more significant, but it's not yet at a point of desperation."
