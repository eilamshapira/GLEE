"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000
2. If I reject and move to the next round:
   * The money will be worth 20% less to me
   * $10,000 in the next round will effectively be worth $8,000 to me
   * But I'll get to make the offer

The current offer gives me $4,000. If I reject, even if I propose to take most of the money in the next round, it will be worth less due to inflation. Also, Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation.

Given this is the first round and I'm still getting a substantial portion without any inflation penalty, I'll accept.
