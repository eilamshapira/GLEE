"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to think strategically about how to divide the $1,000,000. Since this is a multi-round negotiation with Bob experiencing 5% inflation per round while I don't face inflation, I have some leverage. However, I should still make a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

I propose this division because it gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Bob might accept rather than moving to the next round where his money would be worth less. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to consider his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this situation carefully. 

Bob rejected my original 520K/480K split and is now offering a reversal of those numbers. I need to consider if I should accept or reject based on the inflation effects.

If I reject, we go to round 3 where:
- Bob's money will depreciate by another 5% (total 10% from original value)
- I can make a new offer
- Bob might be more willing to accept a better deal for me due to continued inflation

Since I don't face any inflation penalty, I have a strategic advantage by continuing. If Bob's share depreciates 5% each round, I can potentially get a better deal by waiting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now that we're in round 3, I should consider that Bob's money has already depreciated by 5% in value from the previous round. This gives me increasing leverage to negotiate a better deal for myself, while still being somewhat reasonable to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller portion than my initial offer, taking advantage of the fact that his money is now worth less due to inflation, so he may be more willing to accept rather than continue to another round where he would lose an additional 5% of value."
