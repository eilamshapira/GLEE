"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally to avoid the effects of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I should consider whether accepting Alice's equal split is the best move, given the 5% inflation penalty per round.

If I accept now, I get $5,000. If I reject and make a counter-offer, I risk further negotiations that could decrease the value due to inflation. Even if I asked for more in round 2, the maximum I could get would be less valuable than $5,000 now because of the 5% penalty.

Since this is a fair initial offer and the money loses value with each round, accepting is the rational choice.
