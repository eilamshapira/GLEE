"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and end this quickly 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $40 out of the $100, while taking $60 for herself. While this isn't a 50-50 split, I need to account for the inflation factor - if I reject, the money will be worth 20% less in the next round, meaning the total value to me will decrease.

Let me make a strategic decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, keeping in mind that the total money value is now affected by inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair counter-offer, considering the inflation effect:

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split this evenly at 50-50. This is fair for both of us, and with inflation affecting future rounds, we both benefit from agreeing now rather than dragging this out.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you than the next round 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this situation. Alice is now offering me $42, which is slightly better than her initial offer of $40. However, due to inflation, the money I gain is now worth 36% less than in the first round. 

So the actual value to me would be: $42 × (1 - 0.36) = $42 × 0.64 = $26.88

If I reject and we go to another round, inflation will reduce the value even further. Also, I notice that inflation is affecting me more severely than it's affecting Alice (36% vs 19%), suggesting that delays hurt me more than they hurt her.

Given this asymmetric inflation and the improved offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
