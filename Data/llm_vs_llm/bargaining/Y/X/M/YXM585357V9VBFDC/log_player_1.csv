"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob that takes into account the 20% inflation penalty I face for each passing round.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the $10,000. This is a fair division that gives us both equal shares of the money. I believe this is reasonable and hope you'll accept so we can both walk away with a good amount."
