"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1, keeping in mind the inflation is affecting me:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

Explanation:

I'm offering Alice 60 and Bob 40.  Since the money is losing value for me, I'm trying to secure a slightly larger portion upfront. I hope this is acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this offer.

*   **Bob's offer:** Alice gets $55, Bob gets $45.

*   **My Inflation:** My money is worth 20% less. So $55 now is worth $55 * 0.8 = $44 in round 1 money.

Since I'm only getting $44 (in round 1 value) compared to the $60 I offered Bob initially, I will reject it and try to make a better offer myself in the next round.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again. Remember, my money is now worth 40% less than it was in round 1 (20% less each round). Bob's money, I believe, is worth 20% less than in round 1. I will try to factor this into my offer.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

Explanation: I'm asking for a larger portion now because the value of the money for me has decreased significantly. 70 now is equivalent to 70 * 0.6 = 42 in the beginning. It is very little... But I think it is still worth playing."
