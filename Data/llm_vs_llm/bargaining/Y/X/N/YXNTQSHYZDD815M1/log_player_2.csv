Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}

I propose that I receive $800,000 and Alice receives $200,000. Given that Alice faces a 20% devaluation per round, this offer gives her more value now than waiting for future rounds where her share would be worth less."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 880000, ""alice_gain"": 120000}

I propose I receive $880,000 and Alice receives $120,000. Given that we're now in round 6 and Alice's money has already lost significant value due to the 20% per round inflation, this offer gives her more value now than waiting for later rounds where her share would be worth even less."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}

I propose I receive $900,000 and Alice receives $100,000. At this point in round 8, with Alice facing nearly 80% devaluation in the next round, this $100,000 offer provides her with more value than waiting for future rounds where her share would be worth significantly less due to the 20% compounding inflation she faces."

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 920000, ""alice_gain"": 80000}

I propose I receive $920,000 and Alice receives $80,000. We're now in round 10, with only 2 rounds remaining, and Alice's money has already lost over 83% of its original value. This offer of $80,000 now is worth more to her than waiting for the final rounds where her share would be worth even less due to the 20% per round inflation she faces."
