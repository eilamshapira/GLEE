"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split since there's no inflation for me and we both deserve an equal share. This way we both walk away with half a million dollars. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that I'm facing 10% inflation per round, I should carefully consider whether to accept this first offer or risk losing value by waiting.

Alice's offer is a 50-50 split, giving me $500,000. If I reject and propose in the next round, the total value would be worth 10% less to me (effectively $900,000 from my perspective). Even if I could get a significantly better split in the next round, the decreased total value works against me.

Looking at the numbers:
- Current offer: $500,000
- Next round maximum (if I got everything): $900,000
- Realistic next round offer needed to improve my position: >$500,000

A 50-50 split is fair, and considering the inflation penalty I face, accepting now is the rational choice.
