"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since this is the first round and I want to make a fair but advantageous offer while considering potential inflation if Bob refuses, I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is reasonable as waiting will cost us both due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I'll get $40 but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively $32
2. If I reject, I can make another offer in round 3, but then any amount will be worth 40% less than original value
3. My original offer of $60 would have been worth $48 after inflation
4. If I reject, I risk getting even less in future rounds due to compounding inflation

Since $32 now is better than risking further devaluation, and Bob's offer isn't completely unfair...
