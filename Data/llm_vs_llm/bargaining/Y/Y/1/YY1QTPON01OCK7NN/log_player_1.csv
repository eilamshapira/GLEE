"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll play as Alice in this negotiation game.

Let me make a fair and reasonable first offer to Bob, considering the inflation effect on my end.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering you $45, Bob. Given that I face 10% inflation each round, I think this is a fair starting point. If we can agree quickly, we both benefit rather than dragging this out through multiple rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer since Bob is taking a significantly larger portion while knowing I face inflation penalties. Let me make a counterproposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me reconsider my approach, taking into account the inflation effect.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a fair 50-50 split, Bob. Since we're now in round 3, the money I receive is already worth 20% less to me due to inflation. If we don't reach an agreement now, we'll both lose value as we continue negotiating. This even split is fair and allows us both to walk away with something reasonable."
