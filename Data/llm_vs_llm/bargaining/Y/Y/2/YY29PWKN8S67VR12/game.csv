,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,I believe a more balanced split is fair. Let's go with 55% for me and 45% for you. What do you think?,Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"I appreciate your offer, but I think we can still find a more equitable split. Let's try 60/40.  It's a compromise from my initial proposal, and it reflects the fact that we're both losing some value due to inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
475000.0,525000.0,"Given the ongoing inflation, I propose a 52.5% for me and 47.5% for you. This is a fair compromise considering our previous offers and the decreasing value of money. Let's settle this round.",Bob,4,
