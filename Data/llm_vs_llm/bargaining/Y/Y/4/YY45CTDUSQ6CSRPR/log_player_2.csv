"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $450,000 out of the $1,000,000 pot, which is 45% of the total. If I reject this offer, I get to make a counter-proposal in the next round, but the money will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation. 

If I reject and we move to round 2, the $1,000,000 will effectively be worth $950,000 to me. So even if I proposed a more favorable split in the next round, I need to factor in this depreciation.

Given that $450,000 is a substantial portion of the total and the inflation penalty for waiting, I'll accept this offer.
