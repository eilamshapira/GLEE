"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives her a larger portion of the money, I need to consider the 20% inflation penalty for each round if I reject. If I make a counteroffer in round 2, the total value to me will already be reduced by 20%.

Let me evaluate: $400,000 now is better than potentially getting a larger nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation. If I reject and propose a 50-50 split next round, I'd get $500,000 but it would be worth only $400,000 to me due to inflation - the same as Alice's current offer but with additional risk.
