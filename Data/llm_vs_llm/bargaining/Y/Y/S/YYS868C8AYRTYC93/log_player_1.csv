Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less in each round, and we are now in the 3rd round (with the initial value being reduced by 10% twice, i.e., 1 - 0.1 = 0.9, and then 0.9 - 0.09 = 0.81), the current value of the $1,000,000 is $1,000,000 * 0.81 = $810,000.

However, for the division proposal, we still consider the original $1,000,000 amount as the base for the percentage split, but keep in mind the actual value is reduced.

Given this, my offer would be to split it as closely to equal as possible while slightly favoring myself to account for the risk of further inflation reduction:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
