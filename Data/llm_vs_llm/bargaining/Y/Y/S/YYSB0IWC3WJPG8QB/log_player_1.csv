"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a division to Bob, taking into account the 5% inflation per round for my gains.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split with a slight advantage to me since I face 5% inflation per round if we delay. This is nearly 50-50, which respects both our interests while acknowledging the time pressure on my side.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concern about inflation and I believe my offer reflects a reasonable split considering you face a 5% inflation rate. This proposal gives you almost $500000, while acknowledging the pressure on both of us to reach an agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
