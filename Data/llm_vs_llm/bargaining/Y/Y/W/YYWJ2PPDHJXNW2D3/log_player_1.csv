"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a split that takes into account the different inflation rates we face. Since my money loses value faster (20% per round) compared to Bob's (5% per round), I should aim for a fair but favorable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It's a reasonable first offer that gives both parties a substantial amount
2. Given my higher inflation rate, I need a larger initial share to compensate for potential future rounds
3. It still leaves Bob with a significant sum that might be attractive enough to accept"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $350,000 (worth 80% of original value = $280,000 effective value)
   * Bob gets $650,000 (worth 95% of original value = $617,500 effective value)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round will have another 20% reduction for me (down to 60% of original value)
   * Bob will only face another 5% reduction (down to 90% of original value)
   * I can make a new offer

The offer is quite unfavorable to me, giving Bob nearly twice what I would get. Given that we still have 10 rounds left and the current effective value I would receive is only $280,000, I believe I should reject and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given that Bob rejected my initial 60-40 split and countered with a 35-65 split, I'll adjust my offer to be more appealing while still protecting my interests. I need to consider that my money is now worth only 60% of the original value, while Bob's is worth 90%.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this 55-45 split because:
1. It's more favorable to Bob than my first offer
2. It's a reasonable compromise between our previous positions
3. Given the accelerating impact of inflation on my share (20% per round), I still need a larger nominal amount to compensate
4. The actual value Bob would receive is still quite good since his inflation rate is only 5%"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept:
   * I get $400,000 (worth 51.2% of original value = $204,800 effective value)
   * Bob gets $600,000 (worth 85.74% of original value = $514,440 effective value)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round my money will be worth only 41% of original value
   * Bob's will be worth about 81.45% of original value
   * We've used 4 rounds already, with 8 remaining

Bob has improved his offer from the previous round (from 350k to 400k for me), showing willingness to negotiate. However, with each round, my position weakens significantly more than his due to the different inflation rates. If we continue much longer, even a larger nominal amount will be worth very little to me due to the 20% per round inflation.

Given these factors, and that this is a reasonable improvement from his last offer, I should accept now before my negotiating position weakens further.
