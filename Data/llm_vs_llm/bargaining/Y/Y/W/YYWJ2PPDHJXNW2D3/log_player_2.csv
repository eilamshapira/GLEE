"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game and the decaying value of the money. I will make an offer, considering the time constraint and value decay for both of us.

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 650000,
  ""alice_gain"": 350000
}
```

My reasoning: I am asking for a larger share because I know Alice's money depreciates much faster than mine. Hopefully, this is enough to entice her to accept now rather than risk further losses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, the rejections are getting expensive. Let's try this:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000
}
```

Reasoning: I'm lowering my demand a bit. The inflation is hurting us both, but more so her. This should be a more palatable offer for Alice, considering the significant drop in value she is experiencing."
