"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully, given the 10% inflation factor for each round.

Alice has offered me $400,000 while keeping $600,000 for herself. If I reject this offer, I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, but the entire pot will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject, the $1,000,000 will effectively be worth $900,000 to me in the next round. I could potentially ask for more than $400,000, but I need to weigh that against the risk of further rounds and inflation.

Given that I already have an offer for 40% of the total amount, and considering the inflation penalty, I'll respond:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
