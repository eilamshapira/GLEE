"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair offer considering the inflation factor for me.

{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}

I propose this division because the 5% inflation per round affects my earnings more the longer we take to reach an agreement. A slightly higher amount for me now (52.5%) helps offset this disadvantage, while still offering Bob a substantial portion (47.5%) that should be appealing enough to accept early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see that inflation affects Bob more heavily at 20% per round, while I only face 5% inflation. This changes my strategy.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a completely fair 50-50 split. Given that Bob faces much higher inflation (20% per round vs my 5%), this should be appealing to him. With each round that passes, Bob loses more value than I do, so it's in his interest to accept this balanced offer now rather than dragging negotiations further."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I notice Bob is trying to gain a larger share despite facing much higher inflation. Given his 20% inflation rate per round versus my 5%, I need to adjust my strategy but still offer something that should be compelling given his rapidly decreasing value.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I'm offering Bob 55% of the total, which should be very appealing considering his high inflation rate of 20% per round. By round 5, his money is worth less than half its original value, so accepting this offer now is much better for him than waiting another round. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges both our positions."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I see Bob's pattern of consistently asking for more despite his severe inflation penalty. Given that his money is now worth about 67% less than at the start, while mine is only worth about 23% less, I need to be more strategic.

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}

I'm offering Bob 60% of the total amount. Considering his severe inflation rate of 20% per round, this offer gives him much more value now than he would get by continuing to negotiate. At this point, his inflation is so significant that even with a larger nominal share, delaying would drastically reduce his real value. This is a very reasonable compromise that acknowledges his desire for a larger share while recognizing the time pressure we both face."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Given Bob's pattern of demanding increasingly larger shares despite facing severe inflation (now at 79% less value from round 1), I need to make a strategic decision that considers our remaining rounds and the rapidly diminishing value for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 350000, ""bob_gain"": 650000}

I'm offering Bob 65% of the total amount. At this point, with only 3 rounds remaining after this one, Bob's inflation has reduced his money's value by nearly 80%. Even with this larger share, any further delay would catastrophically diminish his returns. This offer is significantly better for Bob than continuing negotiations, as we're approaching the point where neither of us will receive anything if we don't reach an agreement soon. I've moved considerably from my initial position to accommodate his desire for a larger share."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","We're now at round 11 of 12, with only one round remaining after this. Bob is facing catastrophic inflation of over 86%, yet continues to demand larger shares. At this point, I need to make a final reasonable offer that acknowledges our mutual need to reach an agreement before we both get nothing.

{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000}

I'm offering Bob 70% of the total amount. With his inflation at nearly 87% and only one round remaining after this, this offer gives him substantially more value than continuing to the final round. If we don't reach an agreement in the next round, we both get nothing. This is my final significant concession, giving Bob a very large majority of the nominal amount to offset his extreme inflation disadvantage. I strongly urge Bob to accept this offer rather than risk both of us walking away with nothing."
