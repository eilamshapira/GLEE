"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that takes into account the inflation penalty for me while being reasonable for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which seems fair given that I face a 5% inflation penalty if we move to the next round. This gives Bob a substantial portion while protecting my interests against the depreciation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting $25,000 less than what I proposed, the 5% inflation penalty means the money is already worth less to me. If I reject and we move to another round, I'd face additional inflation, potentially resulting in less value overall. Getting $525,000 now is better than risking further depreciation of my share."
