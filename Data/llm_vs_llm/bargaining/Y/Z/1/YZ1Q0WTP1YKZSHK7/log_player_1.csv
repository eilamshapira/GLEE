"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, a bit more balanced 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $450,000, which is worth 5% less than its original value. 

To calculate the actual value I'll get: $450,000 * 0.95 = $427,500.

Since this is the first offer I've received, I'll consider it. However, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. For me, it's worth 5% less than in Round 2, which means it's 10% less than the original value (1 - 0.05 = 0.95, 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025). For Bob, it's worth 10% less than in Round 2, which means it's 20% less than the original value (1 - 0.10 = 0.90, 0.90 * 0.90 = 0.81).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, 
""bob_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""My turn again, a bit more in my favor""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Equal split, last chance for a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","An equal split! Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $500,000, which is worth 14.26% less than its original value. 

To calculate the actual value I'll get: $500,000 * (1 - 0.1426) = $500,000 * 0.8574 = $428,700.

Given the significant decrease in value due to inflation, an equal split might not be a bad idea. It's better to get something than risk losing more value in subsequent rounds.
