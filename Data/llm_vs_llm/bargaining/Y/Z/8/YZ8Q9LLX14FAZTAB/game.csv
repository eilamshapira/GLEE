4000.0,6000.0,"Since your money loses 10% value each round, this $4000 now (worth $4000 to you) is better than $5000 next round (which would only be worth $3600 to you). This is a fair deal considering the time pressure.",Bob,2,

3000.0,7000.0,"Due to 29% inflation on your side, this $3000 is actually worth only $2130 to you. If you reject, your money will lose even more value next round. This is your best option now, as any future splits will be worth even less to you due to increasing inflation.",Bob,4,
