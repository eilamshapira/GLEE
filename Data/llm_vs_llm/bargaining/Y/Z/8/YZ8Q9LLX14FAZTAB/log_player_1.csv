"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair deal""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since your money loses 10% value each round, this $4000 now (worth $4000 to you) is better than $5000 next round (which would only be worth $3600 to you). This is a fair deal considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's being clever, but I'm not convinced.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, and it's already worth 19% less for me compared to the start (10% in round 1 + 9% in round 2, due to compounding), I'll aim for a bit more to compensate.

{""alice_gain"": 5800, 
""bob_gain"": 4200, 
""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a reasonable split""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Due to 29% inflation on your side, this $3000 is actually worth only $2130 to you. If you reject, your money will lose even more value next round. This is your best option now, as any future splits will be worth even less to you due to increasing inflation. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I still think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really starting to bite, with the money being worth around 37.4% less for me compared to the start. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Last chance for a reasonable split, Bob""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: At this point, your money has lost 44% of its value. This $2000 is worth only $1120 to you now. If you reject, the next round will be even worse as your money continues to lose value. This is your best remaining option - any further delays will only reduce your purchasing power more. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really crippling my potential earnings now. I think it's time to cut my losses.
