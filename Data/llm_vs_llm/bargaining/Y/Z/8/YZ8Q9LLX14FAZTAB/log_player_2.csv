"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it evenly, fair deal 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Since Alice's money loses 10% value each round and mine doesn't, I have an advantage by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round. If I reject, her $5000 will be worth $4500 to her in the next round, which means I could potentially negotiate a better deal for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money loses 10% value each round, I'll propose a split that reflects this change while still being reasonable enough for her to accept. If she rejects, her money will lose another 10% value, so this should be compelling for her.

{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Since your money loses 10% value each round, this $4000 now (worth $4000 to you) is better than $5000 next round (which would only be worth $3600 to you). This is a fair deal considering the time pressure.""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a reasonable split 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice is offering me $4200, which is worth full value to me
2. She's taking $5800, but due to 19% inflation, it's only worth about $4698 to her
3. If I reject, in the next round her money will be worth 29% less, giving me even more negotiating power
4. The fact that she's trying to take more despite her money being worth less suggests she's not fully accounting for her weakening position

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money has lost 29% of its value in this round, I'll make an offer that reflects this reality while being attractive enough for her to accept. If she rejects, her money will lose even more value in the next round.

{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Due to 29% inflation on your side, this $3000 is actually worth only $2130 to you. If you reject, your money will lose even more value next round. This is your best option now, as any future splits will be worth even less to you due to increasing inflation.""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance for a reasonable split, Bob 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice is offering me $3500 (full value)
2. She wants $6500, but with 34.39% inflation, it's only worth about $4265 to her
3. Her offer is worse for me than her first offer, despite her money being worth much less now
4. If I reject, in the next round her money will be worth about 44% less, giving me even stronger negotiating position
5. She's still not properly accounting for her weakening position due to inflation

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","With Alice's money now worth 44% less in this round, I'll make an offer that strongly emphasizes her deteriorating position while still leaving her with something meaningful.

{
""bob_gain"": 8000,
""alice_gain"": 2000,
""message"": ""At this point, your money has lost 44% of its value. This $2000 is worth only $1120 to you now. If you reject, the next round will be even worse as your money continues to lose value. This is your best remaining option - any further delays will only reduce your purchasing power more.""
