"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $4000 for me, $6000 for Alice
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - My money will be worth 5% less
   - Alice's money will be worth 20% less
3. Alice will be more likely to accept a less favorable deal next round due to her higher depreciation rate
4. Maximum potential next round: Could propose ~$6000 for me, $4000 for Alice
   - For Alice, $4000 after 20% depreciation = $3200 equivalent
   - She might still accept due to heavy depreciation

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice faces a much steeper depreciation rate (20% vs my 5%), I have leverage to propose a deal more favorable to me. However, I need to ensure it's still attractive enough for her to accept rather than risk another round of heavy depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

Let me explain my proposal to Alice: Given the significant depreciation rate you face (20%), this offer of $4000 now is more valuable than waiting another round where your share would be worth much less. This is a fair deal considering our different depreciation rates."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Current offer: $4200 for me, $5800 for Alice
2. Due to inflation:
   - My $4200 is actually worth $3790.5 (9.75% less)
   - Alice's $5800 is worth $3712 (36% less)
3. If I reject:
   - Next round will have another 5% depreciation for me (total 14.75%)
   - Another 20% depreciation for Alice (total 56%)
   - The gap is getting larger and both of us are losing value

This offer is slightly better than her first offer ($4000), and given the significant depreciation we've both experienced, continuing would hurt both of us substantially.
