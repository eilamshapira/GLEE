"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, considering we both want to maximize our gains and that waiting reduces value more for Bob than for me.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I suggest this split because:
1. It's close to fair, giving Bob a substantial portion
2. Since Bob's money devalues faster (10% vs my 5%), he has more incentive to accept now
3. If he refuses, his negotiating position weakens more than mine in the next round"
