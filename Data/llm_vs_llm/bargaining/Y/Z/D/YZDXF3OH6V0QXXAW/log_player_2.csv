"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. If I accept now:
   * I get $45
   * Alice gets $55

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But the money will be worth 10% less to me and 5% less to Alice
   * $45 now is better than $50 next round (which would be worth $45 to me due to 10% inflation)

This is actually a reasonable first offer. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of losing value through inflation and potential future rejections makes this a decent deal. I'm getting 45% of the pot without any delay.
