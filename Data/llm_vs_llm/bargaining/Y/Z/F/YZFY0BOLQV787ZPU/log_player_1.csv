Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 689655, ""bob_gain"": 310345, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for a swift and fair resolution: I receive $689,655 and you receive $310,345. Given that every delay costs us—my share devalues at 5% per round and yours even faster at 10%—this division reflects the equilibrium outcome if we were to bargain further. Accepting this now guarantees you more than waiting for the next round. Looking forward to your agreement!""}"
