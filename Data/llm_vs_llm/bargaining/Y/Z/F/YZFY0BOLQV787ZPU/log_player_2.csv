Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for a swift and fair resolution: I receive $689655 and you receive $310345. Given that every delay costs us—my share devalues at 5% per round and yours even faster at 10%—this division reflects the equilibrium outcome if we were to bargain further. Accepting this now guarantees you more than waiting for the next round. Looking forward to your agreement! 
# Bob gain: 310345 
# Alice gain: 689655 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
