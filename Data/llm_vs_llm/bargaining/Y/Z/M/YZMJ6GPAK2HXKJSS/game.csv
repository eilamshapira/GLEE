4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I understand we both want a good deal here. Your initial offer was quite unbalanced. I'm proposing a more equitable split where I get $5500 and you get $4500. This is fair considering I face a 20% inflation penalty per round. Let's agree and both walk away with a good amount instead of continuing and losing value.",Bob,2,

6000.0,4000.0,"Alright Bob, since you rejected my initial offer, let's try this. I'm proposing 6000 for me and 4000 for you. This offer is better than the last for you. Let's not drag this out any further.",Alice,3,
