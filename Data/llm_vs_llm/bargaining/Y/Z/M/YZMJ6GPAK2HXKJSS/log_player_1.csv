"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand we both want a good deal here. Your initial offer was quite unbalanced. I'm proposing a more equitable split where I get $5500 and you get $4500. This is fair considering I face a 20% inflation penalty per round. Let's agree and both walk away with a good amount instead of continuing and losing value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
