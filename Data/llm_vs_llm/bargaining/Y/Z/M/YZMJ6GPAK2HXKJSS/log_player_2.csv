"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a generous split, Bob! I'm taking 8000 and offering you 2000.  We can end this now and you still get a good chunk of the money! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully, taking into account the inflation effect.

Alice is offering me $2000 out of the $10,000 total, which is only 20% of the pot. If I reject and we go to the next round, I can make my own offer, but the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject, in the next round the $10,000 would effectively be worth $8,000 to me. This means I should reject only if I believe I can secure more than $2000 in the next round.

Given that I'd be making the offer next and I could propose a more equitable split, I think it's worth rejecting this very uneven offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for my inflation concern while still being fair to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand we both want a good deal here. Your initial offer was quite unbalanced. I'm proposing a more equitable split where I get $5500 and you get $4500. This is fair considering I face a 20% inflation penalty per round. Let's agree and both walk away with a good amount instead of continuing and losing value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, since you rejected my initial offer, let's try this. I'm proposing 6000 for me and 4000 for you. This offer is better than the last for you. Let's not drag this out any further. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this new offer considering the inflation effect.

Alice is now offering me $4000, which is a significant improvement over her initial $2000 offer. However, due to inflation, this $4000 is worth only 64% of its original value to me (36% less than in the first round). So effectively, this $4000 is worth $2,560 to me in round 1 terms.

If I reject and we go to round 4, I'd face even more inflation (likely around 49% less than round 1), making any future gains substantially less valuable.

Given that Alice has moved significantly from her initial position, and considering the compounding inflation penalty I face, this improved offer makes sense to accept now rather than risk further devaluation.
