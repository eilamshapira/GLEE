Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to avoid the effects of inflation we can settle right away. I propose that I receive $30.74 and you get $69.26. This division reflects our future bargaining positions if we delay â€“ accepting now means we both avoid further devaluation. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 69.26 
# Alice gain: 30.74 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
