"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's initial offer gives me $45, which is less than half, I need to consider the risk of moving to the next round. Since there's no inflation for me, I can risk rejecting without losing value. I should propose a more balanced split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more equal split that's slightly in my favor.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose we split the money with $55 for me and $45 for you, which is a fair division that gives us both a substantial portion of the total."
