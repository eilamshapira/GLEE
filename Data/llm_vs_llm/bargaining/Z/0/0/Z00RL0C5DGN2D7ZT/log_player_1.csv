"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55/45 split—with me receiving $55 and you $45. Given that the money depreciates by 5% for me each round, I believe it's in both our interests to settle quickly. Let me know if you agree to this offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know you mentioned that money loses value as rounds progress, and while your funds depreciate by 5% each round, mine remain unaffected. To avoid further devaluation on your end, I propose settling in round 2: you receive $1 and I receive $99. I believe a swift agreement is in both our interests. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 100, ""message"": ""Bob, I recognize that with each additional round my portion suffers further devaluation and that you’re in a strong position. To avoid prolonging negotiations—and to prevent even more loss on my end—I'm willing to concede the full amount to you. Let's settle in round 3 and close this chapter quickly.""}"
