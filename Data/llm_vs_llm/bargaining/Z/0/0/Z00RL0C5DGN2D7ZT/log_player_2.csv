"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a 55/45 split—with me receiving $55 and you $45. Given that the money depreciates by 5% for me each round, I believe it's in both our interests to settle quickly. Let me know if you agree to this offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 99, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""Alice, I know you mentioned that money loses value as rounds progress, and while your funds depreciate by 5% each round, mine remain unaffected. To avoid further devaluation on your end, I propose settling in round 2: you receive $1 and I receive $99. I believe a swift agreement is in both our interests.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I recognize that with each additional round my portion suffers further devaluation and that you’re in a strong position. To avoid prolonging negotiations—and to prevent even more loss on my end—I'm willing to concede the full amount to you. Let's settle in round 3 and close this chapter quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
