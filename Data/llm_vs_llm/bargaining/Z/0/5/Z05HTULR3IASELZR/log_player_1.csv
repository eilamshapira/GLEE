"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's settle this early. I propose $60 for me and $40 for you. Accept now and we both benefit from acting promptly before any inflation diminishes my share's value. Looking forward to your response.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  It's a strong offer, especially considering the time pressure from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
