"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. Alice is proposing I get $2,000 while she gets $8,000, which is quite uneven - she's asking for 80% of the total amount. Since there's no negative inflation effect for me, I can safely reject this and make a counter-offer in the next round. I believe I can negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but still giving Alice a bit more to increase chances of acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500}

This offer gives Alice a reasonable advantage while being much fairer than her initial proposal. I'm offering her 55% of the total amount, which is generous but not excessive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's gain of $6,400 is actually worth only $4,096 to her (due to 36% inflation)
2. My gain of $3,600 maintains its full value (no inflation for me)
3. This is a much better offer than her first one ($2,000)
4. If I reject, inflation will continue to affect Alice's portion in the next round

Given that:
- The offer is more reasonable than before
- Alice is already experiencing significant inflation
- I maintain full value of my portion
- Further negotiation might lead to both of us getting less value

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
