"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider Alice's offer. She's proposing that I get $49 and she gets $51 out of the $100.

This is actually a pretty fair offer, as it's nearly a 50-50 split with just a slight advantage to her. While I could reject and propose a more favorable split in the next round, there's a risk of us getting caught in a back-and-forth negotiation that could waste rounds. Since we have a limited number of rounds (12) and we both get nothing if we don't reach an agreement, accepting a reasonable offer early is sensible.
