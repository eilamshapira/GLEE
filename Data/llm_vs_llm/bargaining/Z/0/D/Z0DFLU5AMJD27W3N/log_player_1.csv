"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll send an offer to Bob. Given the 10% inflation for me each round, it's in my interest to make a fair offer now.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally - $50 for each of us. This is a fair division that respects both our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer. While it's slightly in his favor, the 10% inflation per round means that if I reject and we continue to another round, my share would be worth even less. This is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to gain significant value."
