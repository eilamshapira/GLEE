"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose we split the money equally 50-50. This is fair for both of us, and we should agree quickly to avoid further inflation reducing the total amount. If we keep rejecting offers, we'll both end up with less. Let's make a deal now. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
