"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. It's a fair start considering I'm taking the initiative. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has proposed a 60-40 split in her favor, giving her $60 and me $40. While this isn't an equal split, I should consider a few factors:

1. If I reject, we move to round 2 where the total amount decreases by 20% to $80
2. I would need to make a counter-offer in round 2
3. There's a risk of back-and-forth rejections that could significantly reduce our total

Given that I'd get $40 now versus potentially less after inflation in future rounds, and considering the risk of continued disagreement, I'll reject this initial offer to propose a more balanced split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counter-offer that accounts for the fact that we've already lost 20% of the value due to inflation. A fair split would be better for both of us than continued rejections.

{""bob_gain"": 50, 
""alice_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I propose we split the money equally 50-50. This is fair for both of us, and we should agree quickly to avoid further inflation reducing the total amount. If we keep rejecting offers, we'll both end up with less. Let's make a deal now.""}"
