"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for myself while keeping it reasonable enough for Bob to accept, considering the 5% inflation penalty for each rejected offer.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose to take $60 and give Bob $40. This is a fair offer considering I'm making the first move, and Bob should consider accepting it since waiting will reduce the money's value due to inflation."
