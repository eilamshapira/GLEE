"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, while taking $60 for herself. If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-proposal in the next round, but due to inflation, the total value will be worth 10% less to me (so the $100 would effectively be worth $90 to me). 

My $40 now is better than potentially getting a larger share of a smaller pie. If I reject and propose a 50-50 split next round, that would be $45 for me (half of $90), which is only slightly better than the $40 I'm being offered now. And Alice might reject my counter-offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation.
