60.0,40.0,"I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor, considering I'm facing value depreciation while you're not affected by inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, rejecting this offer means entering a round where your share will suffer an extra 5% depreciation. Accepting now guarantees you $45 at a higher real value. Let's settle quickly and avoid further loss!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"I'm slightly lowering my request to 58-42, which is more favorable to you than my initial offer. Given the inflation impact on my gains, this is quite reasonable. Let's not drag this out further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
44.0,56.0,"Alice, every additional round means a 5% further erosion of your gains. Accepting now, you lock in $44—worth about $37.70 in round 1 value—whereas waiting will only shrink that value further. Let's settle this round and avoid unnecessary losses.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
55.0,45.0,"I'm making a significant concession by lowering my request to 55. With inflation already at ~15%, this is actually worth much less to me. If we don't agree soon, we both risk getting nothing. This is a fair compromise.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, every round you wait erodes the value of your share by roughly an additional 5%. At round 6, your $40 is worth even less than it sounds—about 23.5% less than its round 1 value. Accepting now secures a guaranteed outcome that's far superior to the diminished returns you'd face in later rounds. Let's avoid further loss and agree on this offer.",Bob,6,
