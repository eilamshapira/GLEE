"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, rejecting this offer means entering a round where your share will suffer an extra 5% depreciation. Accepting now guarantees you $45 at a higher real value. Let's settle quickly and avoid further loss! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

It's not a good enough offer considering I started with a more equitable proposal. The inflation pressure is real but I still have rounds to negotiate a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, 
""bob_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""I'm slightly lowering my request to 58-42, which is more favorable to you than my initial offer. Given the inflation impact on my gains, this is quite reasonable. Let's not drag this out further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every additional round means a 5% further erosion of your gains. Accepting now, you lock in $44—worth about $37.70 in round 1 value—whereas waiting will only shrink that value further. Let's settle this round and avoid unnecessary losses. 
# Alice gain: 44 
# Bob gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is still too low. Even with inflation pressure, I can afford a few more rounds of negotiation to reach a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I'm making a significant concession by lowering my request to 55. With inflation already at ~15%, this is actually worth much less to me. If we don't agree soon, we both risk getting nothing. This is a fair compromise.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, every round you wait erodes the value of your share by roughly an additional 5%. At round 6, your $40 is worth even less than it sounds—about 23.5% less than its round 1 value. Accepting now secures a guaranteed outcome that's far superior to the diminished returns you'd face in later rounds. Let's avoid further loss and agree on this offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The inflation pressure is becoming too significant, and Bob seems firm in his negotiation strategy. While this isn't the ideal split I hoped for, accepting $40 now (worth about $31 in round 1 value) is better than risking further depreciation or potentially getting nothing if we reach round 12 without agreement."
