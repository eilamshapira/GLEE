"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair 60-40 split in my favor, considering I'm facing value depreciation while you're not affected by inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, rejecting this offer means entering a round where your share will suffer an extra 5% depreciation. Accepting now guarantees you $45 at a higher real value. Let's settle quickly and avoid further loss!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm slightly lowering my request to 58-42, which is more favorable to you than my initial offer. Given the inflation impact on my gains, this is quite reasonable. Let's not drag this out further. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 56, ""alice_gain"": 44, ""message"": ""Alice, every additional round means a 5% further erosion of your gains. Accepting now, you lock in $44—worth about $37.70 in round 1 value—whereas waiting will only shrink that value further. Let's settle this round and avoid unnecessary losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm making a significant concession by lowering my request to 55. With inflation already at ~15%, this is actually worth much less to me. If we don't agree soon, we both risk getting nothing. This is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, every round you wait erodes the value of your share by roughly an additional 5%. At round 6, your $40 is worth even less than it sounds—about 23.5% less than its round 1 value. Accepting now secures a guaranteed outcome that's far superior to the diminished returns you'd face in later rounds. Let's avoid further loss and agree on this offer.""}"
