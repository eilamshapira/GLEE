"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 4000$ while taking 6000$ for herself. Given that:
1. There are still 11 rounds left
2. Each round reduces Alice's value by 5%, while my value stays the same
3. In the next round, I could make a counter-offer

I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this and making my own proposal next round. For Alice, waiting one round means her 6000$ would be worth 5% less (5700$ in value to her), which gives me negotiating power.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a more favorable proposal for myself. Given that:
1. Alice faces a 5% depreciation per round
2. She needs to consider that rejecting my offer will make her next potential gain worth less
3. A fair offer will be more likely to be accepted

I'll propose:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

This is more balanced than her initial offer, and considering the time pressure and depreciation Alice faces, it should be a reasonable proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice has slightly improved her offer (from 4000 to 4200 for me)
2. For Alice, the 5800 is actually worth only ~5235 due to the 9.75% inflation she faces
3. There are still 9 rounds left
4. If I reject, I can make another offer next round when her value will depreciate further

Since Alice's position weakens each round due to inflation, and her current offer is still quite far from a fair split, I believe I can get a better deal by continuing negotiation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic offer:
1. Alice now faces 14.75% depreciation if she rejects and waits another round
2. Her previous offer shows she's slowly becoming more willing to give me a larger share
3. I need to find a balance between getting a good deal and making it attractive enough for Alice to accept

I'll propose:

{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200}

This offer gives me a better share while still leaving Alice with a significant amount. Given the depreciation she faces, 4200 now is better for her than waiting for future rounds where she might get more nominally but it would be worth less to her due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice has again improved her offer (from 4200 to 4400 for me)
2. For Alice, her 5600 is actually worth only ~4562 due to the 18.55% inflation she faces
3. We're 5 rounds in, with 7 rounds remaining
4. Alice's position continues to weaken due to inflation

While Alice is gradually increasing my share, the offer is still not optimal from my perspective. Given that:
- Alice's effective value continues to decrease each round
- She's showing a pattern of increasing my share
- I maintain full value of my gains regardless of time
- There are still several rounds left

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic offer:
1. Alice now faces significant depreciation (23.55% if she waits another round)
2. She's shown a pattern of gradually increasing my share
3. Her last amount (5600) was worth only about 4562 to her
4. We're halfway through the rounds, increasing pressure to reach an agreement

I'll propose:

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

This offer is justified because:
- For Alice, 4000 now is worth more than a larger amount several rounds later due to her 5% per round depreciation
- The pressure of potentially getting nothing if we reach round 12 is building
- I maintain my negotiating power as my value doesn't depreciate
- It's a round number that represents a clear 60-40 split, which might be psychologically appealing"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice has increased my offer again (from 4400 to 4600)
2. Her 5400 is only worth ~3970 to her due to 26.49% inflation
3. We have 5 rounds remaining
4. Alice's effective value continues to decrease substantially each round

Looking at the pattern:
- Alice keeps improving my share by 200 each time
- Her real value is significantly impacted by inflation
- She's likely to offer even better terms in future rounds
- I still maintain full value of whatever I receive

Given that her position continues to weaken and there are still 5 rounds left, I believe I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let's analyze the situation:
1. Alice's money is now worth 31.49% less if she waits another round
2. She's been increasing my share by 200 each time (from 4000 to 4200 to 4400 to 4600)
3. We have only 4 rounds left after this one
4. The threat of getting nothing is becoming more real

Given this, I'll propose:

{""bob_gain"": 6200, ""alice_gain"": 3800}

This offer makes sense because:
- For Alice, 3800 now is worth more than 5400 several rounds later due to her severe depreciation
- We're getting close to the deadline, increasing pressure to reach a deal
- The risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12 is becoming significant
- My previous offer of 6000-4000 was rejected, but Alice has shown willingness to improve my share consistently"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation carefully:
1. Alice has again increased my offer (to 4800)
2. Her 5200 is only worth ~3450 to her due to 33.66% inflation
3. Only 3 rounds remain after this one
4. The risk of getting nothing is becoming very serious

Looking at the dynamics:
- Alice continues to show flexibility by increasing my share
- We're getting dangerously close to the deadline
- Her real value continues to decrease significantly
- However, her pattern suggests she might offer 5000 in her next turn

Given the limited remaining rounds and increasing risk of both getting nothing, plus the fact that 4800 is a reasonably good offer, I think it's time to accept.
