"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make this quick and fair - I'm offering you a generous $4500 considering we're in round 1. The money will be worth less for both of us if we continue. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $4500 out of $10,000, which is 45% of the total. While this isn't quite a 50-50 split, there are a few important considerations:

1. If I reject, we move to round 2 where:
- My money will be worth 5% less
- Alice's money will be worth 20% less
- I'll get to make the next offer

2. Alice's higher inflation rate (20%) puts her at a disadvantage in later rounds, which gives me some negotiating power.

3. However, $4500 is a decent offer for round 1, and the guaranteed 45% might be better than risking value loss through inflation.

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes prolonging the game risky. Given these factors, I'll accept this offer.
