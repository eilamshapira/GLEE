"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a division of $100 where I take $60 and you get $40. Since with each round my share loses 10% of its value, it's best for both of us to settle now rather than risk waiting. I hope you agree to close the deal in round 1. Best, Alice""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your proposal. I think we can find something more balanced. How about a 55/45 split in my favor? It's a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
