"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a division of $100 where I take $60 and you get $40. Since with each round my share loses 10% of its value, it's best for both of us to settle now rather than risk waiting. I hope you agree to close the deal in round 1. Best, Alice 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
