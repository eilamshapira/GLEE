"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me propose a fair division while considering the inflation risk.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this division because if Bob rejects it, in the next round the $100 will only be worth $80 to me due to 20% inflation. By offering Bob a reasonable $40, I hope he'll accept and we can both benefit without risking value loss from inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this carefully:

1. If I accept Bob's offer of $45, due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $36 to me (45 * 0.8)
2. If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, the total amount will be worth even less to me (another 20% reduction)
3. My next offer would be worth only 60% of its nominal value to me
4. Bob knows about my inflation penalty and can use this to his advantage

Given these factors, while $36 effective value isn't ideal, rejecting would likely lead to an even worse outcome for me as my negotiating position weakens with each round due to inflation.
