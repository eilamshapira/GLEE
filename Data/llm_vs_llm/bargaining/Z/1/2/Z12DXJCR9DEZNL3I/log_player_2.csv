"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a classic Ultimatum Game with a twist of inflation. While a 50/50 split seems fair, the inflation factor means I stand to potentially gain more by waiting for a better offer in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000} 

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This gives me a larger share while still leaving Alice with a significant sum.  She might be more inclined to accept knowing that the pot gets smaller for both of us as time goes on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is worse than her first offer!  While it might be tempting to accept as the money is decreasing in value, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Alice's willingness to offer me less suggests she may be getting worried about the shrinking pot."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. I'm mirroring her previous offer as a way to signal this is a serious offer and a potential compromise. It's still a better split for me than her offer in the last round and accounts for the increasing impact of inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting ridiculous! Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to her advantage.  However, accepting an offer where I get less than half is not a palatable option.  I'm willing to gamble that she'll get nervous as we get closer to the final rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm going back to the initial 50/50 split.  This might seem counterintuitive, but I'm hoping this will appear as a fair offer in light of her increasingly greedy proposals. The pressure is on for her to accept, knowing the value diminishes with each passing round."
