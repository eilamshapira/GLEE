"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the potential inflation risk while remaining fair enough to have a good chance of acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I suggest this 60-40 split because I need to protect myself against the 20% inflation penalty if Bob rejects and we go to another round. A 50-50 split might seem fairer, but with the inflation risk, I need to aim for a higher initial share to offset potential future losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer:
   * I get $5000, but with 20% inflation, it's actually worth $4000 to me
   * This is less than what I could have gotten in round 1 ($6000 with no inflation)

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make another offer
   * But I'll face another 20% inflation penalty
   * $10000 will be worth even less to me in the next round
   * There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer

Since $4000 (current value of $5000 with inflation) is still a significant amount, and continuing would mean facing even more severe inflation penalties, I should accept this offer.
