Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand we need to reach an agreement; I propose to go back to a similar split as your first offer. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a good time to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Inflation Benefit:** While the nominal value is the same as my initial offer, inflation has eroded the value of Bob's share by 27.1%. This means I'm essentially getting a better deal than in Round 1.
* **Risk of Further Rounds:**  Continuing to reject offers carries the risk that Bob will propose even less favorable splits as inflation eats further into his potential gains.  

It's better to secure a favorable deal now than to risk getting a worse outcome later."
