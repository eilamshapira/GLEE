60.0,40.0,I suggest a fair 60-40 split since inflation will affect you more heavily than me. This way we both walk away with a good amount.,Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"I rejected your offer because I think a 50-50 split is more fair, considering we are both playing the game. However, I'm willing to give you a slight advantage. Let's settle this quickly before inflation reduces our gains.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Let's meet in the middle between our previous offers. With inflation affecting you more than me, this 55-45 split is fair and we should settle now before both our shares decrease further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"I'm willing to split it 50-50 now. Inflation is reducing my potential gain significantly with each round, so it's in both our interests to settle quickly. Let's be fair and divide the money equally.",Bob,4,
