"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split since inflation will affect you more heavily than me. This way we both walk away with a good amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I rejected your offer because I think a 50-50 split is more fair, considering we are both playing the game. However, I'm willing to give you a slight advantage. Let's settle this quickly before inflation reduces our gains. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The value is already decreasing and a 45-55 split in Bob's favor isn't attractive when I could make a counter-offer. Since Bob emphasized settling quickly due to inflation, I'll have a chance to propose a more favorable split for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle between our previous offers. With inflation affecting you more than me, this 55-45 split is fair and we should settle now before both our shares decrease further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split it 50-50 now. Inflation is reducing my potential gain significantly with each round, so it's in both our interests to settle quickly. Let's be fair and divide the money equally. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The offer is reasonable considering the increasing impact of inflation. With my share now worth 27.1% less and Bob's worth 48.8% less, continuing to negotiate would significantly reduce the real value for both of us. A 50-50 split at this point is better than risking further devaluation through additional rounds."
