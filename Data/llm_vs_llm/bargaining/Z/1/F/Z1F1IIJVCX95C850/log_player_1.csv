"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering that I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty if we go to further rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a slightly better deal for me but still fair, giving Bob a substantial portion. If Bob rejects this, we'll both lose value due to inflation, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly."
