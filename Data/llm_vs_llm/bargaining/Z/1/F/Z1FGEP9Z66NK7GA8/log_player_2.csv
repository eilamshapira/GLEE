"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, keeping $60 for herself.

If I reject and we go to the next round:
- The total value will decrease by 5% for me and 10% for Alice
- I can make my own proposal
- For me, $100 will become worth $95
- For Alice, $100 will become worth $90

Since I'll have the opportunity to make a better offer in the next round and Alice's money devalues faster than mine, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's money devalues faster than mine (10% vs 5% per round), I have some leverage. However, if she rejects my offer, the next round will give her the proposal power with further devalued money for both of us.

I'll propose a more balanced split that's still in my favor, which should be attractive enough for Alice to accept given her faster devaluation rate.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This split gives me a slight advantage while still being fair enough that Alice should seriously consider accepting it rather than letting the money devalue further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering me $43, which due to 9.75% inflation is actually worth about $38.81 to me
2. If I reject:
   - We go to next round where I can make an offer
   - My money will devalue by another 5% (total 14.75%)
   - Alice's money will devalue by another 10% (total 29%)
   - Alice's rapidly increasing devaluation might make her more desperate

However, considering:
- The substantial devaluation already in effect
- The fact that Alice has increased her offer from the initial $40 to $43
- The risk of further value loss in next rounds
- Alice might become even more conservative in future rounds due to her higher inflation rate

I'll accept this offer. While not ideal, the risk of further devaluation makes this a reasonable compromise.
