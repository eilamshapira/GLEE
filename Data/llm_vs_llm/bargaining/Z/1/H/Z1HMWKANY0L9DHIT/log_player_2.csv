"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, 50-50. It's fair and square! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I need to factor in the inflation effect.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me. So if I were to get $50 now, it would be equivalent to getting $52.63 in the next round ($50 ÷ 0.95 ≈ $52.63).

Since a 50-50 split is generally considered fair, and waiting would require me to secure more than $52.63 to be better off (which might be difficult to achieve), I'll accept this offer.
