I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This ensures a decent starting point for me, while still offering Bob a fair share.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to stick with a similar split, but flip it in my favor this time.  After Bob's rejection, I think he'll be more open to negotiation, and I'll try to leverage the inflation to my advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. Even though I'm getting a significantly lower share than my initial proposal, the inflation has significantly eroded the value of the money, making this the best deal I can get at this point."
