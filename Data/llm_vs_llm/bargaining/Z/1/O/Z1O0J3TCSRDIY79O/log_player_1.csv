"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make the first offer to Bob. I want to propose a fair division that both of us can be happy with.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the money, which gives each of us $500,000. This is the fairest division, and I hope Bob will accept it."
