"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, considering that rejecting offers leads to value loss due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because it's fairer than Alice's initial offer while still giving her a substantial portion. If she rejects this, we'll both lose value due to the 20% inflation penalty."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. While it's not a perfect 50-50 split, considering the 36% inflation that has already occurred, rejecting this offer would lead to even greater losses for both of us. The $4500 I'll receive is now effectively worth only $2880 (after 36% inflation), and waiting longer would only decrease the value further.
