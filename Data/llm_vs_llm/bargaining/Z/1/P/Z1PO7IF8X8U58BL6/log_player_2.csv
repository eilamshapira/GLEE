"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money with a 60-40 ratio in my favor. This ensures we both get a significant amount, and it's a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, which would give me $400,000 and her $600,000.

While this is a substantial amount of money for me, I think it would be fair to counter with my own proposal since we're dividing an even $1,000,000. I'll reject this initial offer so I can make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think a 50-50 split is the most fair and equitable solution. We'd both walk away with half a million dollars, which is a life-changing amount for both of us. This even split respects us both equally as participants in this decision.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob. Let's meet in the middle. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a substantial amount, and it's a step closer to your proposal. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Alice's revised offer. She's now proposing a 55-45 split, which would give me $450,000 and her $550,000. This is moving closer to an even split, and she's shown willingness to negotiate from her initial position.

While I still believe a 50-50 split would be most fair, $450,000 is a significant sum, and continuing to negotiate risks potentially worse outcomes in future rounds. I'll accept this offer.
