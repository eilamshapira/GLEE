2357.13,7642.87,"Hi Bob, I’m proposing that I receive $2357.13 and you receive $7642.87. Given that if you reject, you’d get to propose next round—but with the pot reduced by 5%—this offer reflects our future prospects. I believe it’s a fair division that maximizes our joint value. Let me know what you think.",Alice,1,
