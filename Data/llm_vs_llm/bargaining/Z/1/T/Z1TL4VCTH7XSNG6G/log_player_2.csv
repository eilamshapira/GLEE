"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m proposing that I receive $2357.13 and you receive $7642.87. Given that if you reject, you’d get to propose next round—but with the pot reduced by 5%—this offer reflects our future prospects. I believe it’s a fair division that maximizes our joint value. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob gain: 7642.87 
# Alice gain: 2357.13 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

Alice is offering me $7,642.87 (76.4%) while taking $2,357.13 (23.6%) for herself.

If I reject, I'll get to make a counter-offer next round, but the total pot will be reduced to $9,500 (5% less). That means the maximum I could get next round would be some portion of $9,500.

This is actually a generous offer from Alice, giving me over 3/4 of the money. Since inflation will reduce the total amount in future rounds, and there's risk in continued negotiation, accepting this offer is rational.
