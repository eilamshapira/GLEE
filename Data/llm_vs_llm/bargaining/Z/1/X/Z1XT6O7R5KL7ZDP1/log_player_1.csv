"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Based on a backwards‐induction analysis (taking into account that with each round the total “pie” shrinks by 5%), here’s one way to reason:

1. In round 12 the proposer (Bob) could claim almost the entire remaining amount (≈$56.88), offering Alice virtually nothing since if she rejects she gets $0.
2. Moving backward, in round 11 when you (Alice) are the proposer, you must offer Bob an amount that makes him indifferent to waiting – roughly $56.88 (what he’d later get as proposer). That leaves you with about $59.87 − $56.88 ≈ $3.
3. Continuing this alternating‐offer logic all the way back to round 1 yields an equilibrium offer where, in round 1 the total is full $100. In that equilibrium, Bob’s “waiting” value (should he turn proposer in round 2) turns out to be roughly $76.43. Hence you must offer Bob at least that much in order to gain his agreement.
4. Consequently, your optimal round‑1 proposal as Alice is to keep about $23.57 and give Bob roughly $76.43. (Rounded to the nearest cent.)
