"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The offer is completely fair with an equal 50-50 split. This is the most equitable outcome possible, and there's no reason to reject it in hopes of a better deal, as it could potentially lead to a worse outcome in subsequent rounds."
