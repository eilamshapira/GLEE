51.28,48.72,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for an immediate agreement. Taking into account that any delay will discount our total by 5% per round, I suggest I keep $51.28 while you get $48.72. This split reflects our future bargaining positions if we were to delay and I believe it's a fair starting point for both of us.",Alice,1,
