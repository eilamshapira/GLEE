"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 51.28, ""bob_gain"": 48.72, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for an immediate agreement. Taking into account that any delay will discount our total by 5% per round, I suggest I keep $51.28 while you get $48.72. This split reflects our future bargaining positions if we were to delay and I believe it's a fair starting point for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I suggest an equal split of $50 each. This way, we avoid future losses from inflation and both come out equally. Let's agree and conclude the deal fairly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
