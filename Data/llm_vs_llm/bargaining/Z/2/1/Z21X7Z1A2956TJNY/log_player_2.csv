"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for an immediate agreement. Taking into account that any delay will discount our total by 5% per round, I suggest I keep $51.28 while you get $48.72. This split reflects our future bargaining positions if we were to delay and I believe it's a fair starting point for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 48.72 
# Alice gain: 51.28
