"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the higher inflation impact on Bob. Since we're in round 1, there's no depreciation yet.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a good portion, while slightly favoring me as I'm making the first move. If Bob declines, the total value will decrease for both of us, but more significantly for him due to his higher inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

If I accept Bob's offer now:
- I would get $40, but with 10% inflation, it's worth $36
- Bob would get $60, but with 20% inflation, it's worth $48

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round:
- The money will depreciate further (20% for Bob, 10% for me)
- We might risk more rounds of negotiation

Given that:
1. Bob's offer gives me a lower share despite the money being worth less to him
2. I still have many rounds to negotiate
3. The current offer gives me less than my initial proposal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me make a strategic offer considering the current inflation:
- At round 3, my money is worth 20% less than initial value
- Bob's money is worth 40% less than initial value
- Bob has shown he wants a larger share, but his money devalues faster

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because:
1. For me, $60 with 20% inflation is worth $48
2. For Bob, $40 with 40% inflation is worth $24
3. This compensates for the faster depreciation of Bob's money
4. It's a firm response to his previous aggressive offer
5. There's still room for negotiation if he rejects

If Bob rejects, the next round will make the money worth even less for both of us, so it's in his interest to accept a reasonable offer now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

If I accept Bob's offer now:
- I get $45, but with 27.1% inflation, it's worth $32.80
- Bob gets $55, but with 48.8% inflation, it's worth $28.16

This is actually a more reasonable offer from Bob compared to his previous one:
1. The split is closer to 50-50
2. Due to his higher inflation rate, he's actually getting less real value than me
3. If we continue negotiating, both of us will lose more value
4. We've already gone through 4 rounds, and have 8 left
5. This could be a good point to reach agreement before too much value is lost
