"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that's fair and considers both our interests, given the inflation aspect of the game.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the money. This is the fairest division, giving us each half a million dollars. Since inflation reduces the value by 10% each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This even split respects both of our positions in the game."
