"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing that she gets $6,000 while I get $4,000. While this isn't an equal split, it's not terribly unfair. However, since this is only the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer, I think I'll try to negotiate for a more equitable division.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more equal distribution while still acknowledging that Alice made the first move.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I suggest we split the money equally - $5,000 each. This is the fairest division and benefits us both equally."
