"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, while she takes $60. If I reject this, I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, but the total amount will be worth 5% less to me due to inflation.

Let me evaluate this offer:
- If I accept now, I get $40
- If I reject and we go to the next round, the $100 will be worth $95 to me, and I can propose a different split

While I could propose a more favorable split in the next round, I need to consider that Alice might reject my offer, leading to further rounds and more inflation. Given that I'm already being offered 40% of the pot, which is reasonable though not equal, I'll accept the offer.
