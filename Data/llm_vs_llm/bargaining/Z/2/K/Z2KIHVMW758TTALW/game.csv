344828.0,655172.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for a fair split considering our future depreciation. You’d get $655172 and I’d get $344828 right away—all based on our respective discount rates (I lose 10% per round, you lose 5%). I believe this is a reasonable division to maximize both of our outcomes if we settle now. What do you think?",Alice,1,

320000.0,680000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer in the last round, but I think we can find a slightly better balance. How about I take $680000 and you get $320000?  This still considers the discount factor but gives me a slightly larger share.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I accept your proposal. Given the discounting—10% for me per round and 5% for you per round—the deal as it stands (with me receiving $320000 and you $680000) is in line with what I’d expect in a fair negotiation. Let's settle it now.",Alice,2,accept
