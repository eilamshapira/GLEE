"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 344828, ""bob_gain"": 655172, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for a fair split considering our future depreciation. You’d get $655,172 and I’d get $344,828 right away—all based on our respective discount rates (I lose 10% per round, you lose 5%). I believe this is a reasonable division to maximize both of our outcomes if we settle now. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer in the last round, but I think we can find a slightly better balance. How about I take $680000 and you get $320000?  This still considers the discount factor but gives me a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 320000 
# Bob gain: 680000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I accept your proposal. Given the discounting—10% for me per round and 5% for you per round—the deal as it stands (with me receiving $320,000 and you $680,000) is in line with what I’d expect in a fair negotiation. Let's settle it now.""}"
