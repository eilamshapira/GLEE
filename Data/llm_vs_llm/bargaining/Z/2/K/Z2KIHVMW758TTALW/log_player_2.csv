"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal for a fair split considering our future depreciation. You’d get $655172 and I’d get $344828 right away—all based on our respective discount rates (I lose 10% per round, you lose 5%). I believe this is a reasonable division to maximize both of our outcomes if we settle now. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 655172 
# Alice gain: 344828

""bob_gain"": 680000,
""alice_gain"": 320000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer in the last round, but I think we can find a slightly better balance. How about I take $680,000 and you get $320,000?  This still considers the discount factor but gives me a slightly larger share.""
