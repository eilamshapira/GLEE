"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but let's get this over with quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after each round, I'll make a reasonable offer. 

{""bob_gain"": 600000, 
""alice_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the inflation""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer.  We're both losing money with each round. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $300,000 I'd gain is actually worth around $640,000 in the first round's value (since it's 36% less, or 0.64 of the original value). This is still a significant amount, but I'd like to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 36% less for me (or 0.64 of the original value) after 3 rounds, and it will be worth even less if we proceed, I'll make a more generous offer to Alice.
