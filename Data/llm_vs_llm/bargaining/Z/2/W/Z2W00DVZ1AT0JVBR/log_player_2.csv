"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with an equal split to keep things fair for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 
- If I accept now, I get $50
- If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 20% less
- For example, even if I managed to get $70 next round, it would only be worth $56 to me
- Alice has no depreciation penalty, so she has less pressure to agree quickly

Given these factors, getting $50 now is better than trying to negotiate for more in future rounds where my share will be worth less. The equal split is fair and avoiding depreciation makes it an attractive offer.
