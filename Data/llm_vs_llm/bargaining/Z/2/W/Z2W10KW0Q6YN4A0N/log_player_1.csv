"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll provide an offer to divide the $10,000 between Bob and myself. Since I need to consider that with each passing round, the money is worth 5% less for me (but not for Bob), I should make a reasonable first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This is a fair offer that gives me a bit more than half, acknowledging that I face inflation risk if we continue to the next round."
