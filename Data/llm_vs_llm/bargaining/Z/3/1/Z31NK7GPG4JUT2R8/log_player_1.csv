"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I face a 10% penalty each round. This way we both walk away with a fair amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering your penalty, I'm willing to take a bit more. This way, we both still get a good amount, and it's more fair to me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept now:
   * I get $4500, but with 10% inflation = $4050 effective value
   * Bob gets $5500 at full value

2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make another offer
   * But I'll face another 10% penalty
   * Money will be worth 20% less to me in the next round

Given that each round makes the money worth less to me, and this offer still gives me a significant portion ($4050 in effective value), I should accept. Making another counter-offer would likely lead to worse outcomes due to the compounding inflation penalty.
