"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a fair initial offer. Since we both need to agree and there's inflation pressure, I'll propose a slightly favorable split for Bob to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

This is a reasonable split where Bob gets a bit more than half. I want to avoid multiple rounds due to the 10% inflation penalty on my share, so I'm offering Bob a favorable deal upfront to incentivize immediate acceptance."
