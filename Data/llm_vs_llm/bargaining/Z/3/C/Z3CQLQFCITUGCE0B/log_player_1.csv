"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to consider the decreasing value of the money for me with each round and the fact that I don't know how this affects Bob. To maximize my potential gain while also making it attractive for Bob to accept, I will start with a relatively generous offer to avoid unnecessary rounds.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
