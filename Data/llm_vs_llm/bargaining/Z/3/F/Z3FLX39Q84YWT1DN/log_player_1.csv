"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, considering that inflation will affect my gains in future rounds. Since I want to encourage acceptance, I'll offer slightly more to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000}

I propose this split because it's close to 50-50 but gives Bob a small advantage, making it more likely for him to accept. If he declines, my next opportunity to make an offer will be worth less due to inflation, so I want to make this first offer attractive enough to succeed."
