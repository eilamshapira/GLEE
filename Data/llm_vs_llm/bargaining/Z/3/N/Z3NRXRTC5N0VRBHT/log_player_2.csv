"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to account for the inflation factor - with each round, money becomes worth 5% less to me, while it keeps the same value for Alice.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, we'd be dividing money that's worth 5% less to me. This means I should aim for a bit more than 50% to account for this disadvantage.

However, the risk of prolonged negotiation could lead to significant devaluation of my share. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush, especially with inflation affecting only me.
