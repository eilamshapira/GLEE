"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a reasonable first offer, considering the inflation pressure on my side. I want to be fair but also protect my interests.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a fair split considering I'm affected by 20% inflation per round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. With 20% inflation, $45 now is worth $36 in round 1 terms. This is significantly less than the $60 I proposed. Given that we still have 10 more rounds possible and my value will keep decreasing by 20% each round, I should probably consider accepting to avoid an even worse outcome.

However, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal, especially since the inflation impact of waiting one more round (to $36) is less than accepting this low offer now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Bob rejected my first offer of 60-40 and offered me 45-55, I'll adjust my offer to be more appealing while still protecting my interests. Since the money is worth 40% less for me now compared to round 1, I need to ask for more nominal dollars to get the same real value.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I propose I get $70 and Bob gets $30. This higher nominal amount helps offset my inflation losses, while still leaving Bob with a meaningful share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. $50 in round 4 is worth about $25.60 in round 1 terms (due to 48.8% inflation)
2. If I reject, any future gains will be worth even less
3. Bob seems to be moving towards a more reasonable position (from offering me 45 to now 50)
4. We've already used 4 rounds out of 12, and continuing to negotiate risks getting nothing
5. A 50-50 split is traditionally considered fair, though inflation affects me more

While this isn't ideal given my inflation penalty, the risk of getting an even worse deal or nothing at all is becoming significant.
