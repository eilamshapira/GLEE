"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the fact that money will be worth less for me if we go to further rounds, while Bob doesn't face this penalty. I should offer something fair but attractive enough for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because it gives me a decent share while still offering Bob a substantial portion that should be appealing enough to accept rather than risk a next round where he might get less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept this offer, I'll get $50, but due to 10% inflation, it's actually worth $45 to me
- If I reject and make a new offer in round 3, any money I get will be worth 20% less
- Bob might reject my next offer, leading to even more rounds and worse inflation for me
- $45 value is still substantial, and the risk of getting less in future rounds is significant
