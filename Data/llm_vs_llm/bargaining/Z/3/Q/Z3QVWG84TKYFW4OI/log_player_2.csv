"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Since I know that money loses 10% value for Alice each round but keeps its full value for me, I have an advantage in rejecting and making a counter-offer. If I reject now:
- In the next round, Alice's $60 would only be worth $54 to her
- I could propose a split that gives me more while still being acceptable to Alice due to the depreciation

Therefore, I'll reject this offer to negotiate for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I know Alice's money loses 10% value each round, I can use this to my advantage. If Alice rejects my offer, in the next round her share would be worth even less to her. I should offer her enough to make accepting now more attractive than waiting.

In the next round, any money Alice gets would be worth only 81% of its original value to her (after two 10% drops). So I'll propose a split that gives her a bit more than what she'd likely get in the next round considering the depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

This is a fair split that gives us both equal amounts, and it's in Alice's interest to accept since waiting would make her share worth less to her."
