"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I suggest a fair 60-40 split, considering that my money loses value each round. This way we both benefit without delay.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering your loss of value each round, I'm willing to take a bit more, but still offer you a considerable amount to end the game quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The money I would get is worth even less now due to inflation (45 * 0.95 = 42.75 real value), and Bob's offer gives him more than I originally proposed. I'll make a new proposal in the next round, though I'll need to consider that my share will be worth even less then."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Due to 10% total inflation for me over two rounds, I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. This split gives us both a fair outcome considering the decreasing value of my portion.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the increasing inflation affecting your share, I'm willing to take a bit more, but still offer you a substantial amount to end the game before the value drops further. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With the 14.26% inflation, my $42 is worth about $36 in real value, and if I reject, the next round will have even more inflation (nearly 20%). While this isn't ideal, continuing the game would likely lead to even worse outcomes for me as my negotiating position weakens with each round due to inflation."
