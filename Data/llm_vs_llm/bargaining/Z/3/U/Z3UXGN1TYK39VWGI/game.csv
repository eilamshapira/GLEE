5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that we split the $10000 equally â€“ $5000 for each of us. Since every round that passes reduces the value of the money for me by 20%, I believe settling now with a fair 50/50 split is in both our interests. I hope you agree to this immediate and equitable division.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I'm willing to take a bit more risk. I propose I get $5500 and you get $4500. This way, you still get a substantial amount, and I take on more of the inflation risk. Let's settle this quickly to avoid further devaluation.",Bob,2,
