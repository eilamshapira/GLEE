"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that we split the $10,000 equally â€“ $5,000 for each of us. Since every round that passes reduces the value of the money for me by 20%, I believe settling now with a fair 50/50 split is in both our interests. I hope you agree to this immediate and equitable division.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I'm willing to take a bit more risk. I propose I get $5500 and you get $4500. This way, you still get a substantial amount, and I take on more of the inflation risk. Let's settle this quickly to avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
