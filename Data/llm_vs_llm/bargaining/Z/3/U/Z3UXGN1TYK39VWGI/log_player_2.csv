"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that we split the $10000 equally â€“ $5000 for each of us. Since every round that passes reduces the value of the money for me by 20%, I believe settling now with a fair 50/50 split is in both our interests. I hope you agree to this immediate and equitable division. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation. However, I'm willing to take a bit more risk. I propose I get $5500 and you get $4500. This way, you still get a substantial amount, and I take on more of the inflation risk. Let's settle this quickly to avoid further devaluation.""}"
