"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, further delay will reduce the value for both of usâ€”my share will be worth 10% less per round and yours 20% less. With this offer, you still get a fair 4500, and we avoid more losses from inflation. Let's settle now and go home with as much of the value retained as possible. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
