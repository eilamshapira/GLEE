Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, further delay will reduce the value for both of usâ€”my share will be worth 10% less per round and yours 20% less. With this offer, you still get a fair 4500, and we avoid more losses from inflation. Let's settle now and go home with as much of the value retained as possible.""}"
