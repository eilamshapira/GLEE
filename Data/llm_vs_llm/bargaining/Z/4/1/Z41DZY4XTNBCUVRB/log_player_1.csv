"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since inflation affects me more severely (20% vs your 10%), I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself. This is fair considering our different inflation rates, and it's better for both of us to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
