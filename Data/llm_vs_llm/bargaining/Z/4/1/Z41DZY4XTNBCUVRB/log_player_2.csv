"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take a bit more since I'm proposing, but we can adjust later. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 40/60 split in her favor. With inflation affecting me more severely (20% per round vs her 10%), there's pressure to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. However, if I reject, I can make my own proposal next round.

If I reject, my $40 would be worth $32 next round due to 20% inflation, while her $60 would be worth $54 due to 10% inflation. But I could propose a more favorable split to compensate.

I think I can get a better deal by making my own proposal.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split that accounts for the differing inflation rates we face.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since inflation affects me more severely (20% vs your 10%), I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself. This is fair considering our different inflation rates, and it's better for both of us to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.""}"
