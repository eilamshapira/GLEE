60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob! I propose to take $60 for myself and give you $40. Since our money loses value with each round, this way you get a nice upfront share. What do you think?",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice! Since we have different inflation rates (mine at 10%, yours at 5%), I'm proposing a split that accounts for this difference. This offer gives me $55 and you $45, which is fair considering the asymmetric depreciation if we continue negotiating. This way we both come out ahead rather than losing more value in future rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
57.0,43.0,"Hi Bob! Let's try a slightly different approach. How about I take $57 and you take $43? This way, it's still beneficial for both of us before we lose more value. I hope this works for you!",Alice,3,
