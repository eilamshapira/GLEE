"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I propose to take $60 for myself and give you $40. Since our money loses value with each round, this way you get a nice upfront share. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! Since we have different inflation rates (mine at 10%, yours at 5%), I'm proposing a split that accounts for this difference. This offer gives me $55 and you $45, which is fair considering the asymmetric depreciation if we continue negotiating. This way we both come out ahead rather than losing more value in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! Let's try a slightly different approach. How about I take $57 and you take $43? This way, it's still beneficial for both of us before we lose more value. I hope this works for you!""}"
