"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I propose to take $60 for myself and give you $40. Since our money loses value with each round, this way you get a nice upfront share. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, while taking $60 for herself. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the total amount will be worth less (10% less for me, 5% less for Alice).

If I reject now and propose a 50-50 split in the next round, the $100 would be worth $90 to me and $95 to Alice. My $50 would actually be worth $45 to me, which is better than the $40 I'm offered now.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates and the fact that I can make the next offer, I should reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a fair offer that considers our different inflation rates.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Alice! Since we have different inflation rates (mine at 10%, yours at 5%), I'm proposing a split that accounts for this difference. This offer gives me $55 and you $45, which is fair considering the asymmetric depreciation if we continue negotiating. This way we both come out ahead rather than losing more value in future rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Let's try a slightly different approach. How about I take $57 and you take $43? This way, it's still beneficial for both of us before we lose more value. I hope this works for you! 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $43 out of $100, taking $57 for herself. This is a slight improvement from her initial offer of $40.

Due to inflation, the money I gain is now worth 19% less than in the first round. So the $43 is actually worth $34.83 in round 1 terms.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 4, the money will be worth even less (about 27% less for me). This means even if I get a 50-50 split in the next round, my $50 would only be worth about $36.50 in round 1 terms.

While I'd prefer a more equal split, the inflation penalty makes accepting this offer more favorable than continuing to negotiate.
