"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55.56, ""bob_gain"": 44.44, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $55.56 and you receive $44.44. This split reflects the fact that delaying our agreement costs us 20% per round â€“ accepting today means you secure $44.44 in value, which is as good as your fair share in the alternating offers framework. Let's agree now and avoid further devaluation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split the amount evenly at $50 each. This way, we both get a fair share of the pot without any further devaluation in the next rounds. I believe this is the best option for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
