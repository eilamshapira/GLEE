"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $55.56 and you receive $44.44. This split reflects the fact that delaying our agreement costs us 20% per round â€“ accepting today means you secure $44.44 in value, which is as good as your fair share in the alternating offers framework. Let's agree now and avoid further devaluation! 
# Bob gain: 44.44 
# Alice gain: 55.56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
