"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think through this carefully. Alice is offering an even split of $5,000 for each of us. Since this is the first round, I need to consider whether I should accept or make a counter-offer.

If I reject and we move to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me due to inflation. That means in the next round, the $10,000 would effectively be worth $8,000 to me. So even if I managed to get the entire amount in round 2, it would be worth less than accepting $5,000 now.

This is a fair offer where we both get an equal amount, and considering the inflation penalty I face, it makes sense to accept.
