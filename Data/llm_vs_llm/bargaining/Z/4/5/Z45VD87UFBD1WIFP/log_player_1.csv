"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, the $4500 offered to me is actually worth $4500 * 0.9 = $4050.

Considering this, I don't think the offer is favorable to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 10% less than in the second round, which was already 10% less than in the first round. So, the money I gain is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.

The money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the second round, which was already 20% less than in the first round. So, the money Bob gains is worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value.

Taking this into account, I'll make an offer that favors me slightly more.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the $4200 offered to me is actually worth $4200 * (1 - 0.271) = $4200 * 0.729 = $3061.80.

Considering this, I think the offer is more reasonable now, given the significant decrease in value for both of us.
