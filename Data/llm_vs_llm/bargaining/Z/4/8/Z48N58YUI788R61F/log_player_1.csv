"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, the money will be worth less to me in the next round due to inflation, while it maintains full value for you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think a 55-45 split is fairer, taking into account the inflation. We both get a decent amount, and it gives us both a chance to get something.  Let's avoid the risk of getting nothing in the later rounds! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

At 20% inflation for me, $45 is now worth $36 in round 1 terms.
If I reject and propose in round 3, any amount will be worth 40% less to me.

Bob's offer isn't great for me - I'd only get the equivalent of $36 in round 1 value, while he gets $55.
However, if I reject, I risk getting even less in future rounds due to increasing inflation, and there's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer.
