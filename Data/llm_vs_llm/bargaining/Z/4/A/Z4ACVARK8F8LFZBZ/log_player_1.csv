"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. This is my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slight advantage for myself, anticipating that Bob will want to negotiate. I'm also factoring in the inflation; getting $55 now is better than potentially getting a smaller amount (in real value) later. This offer is also reasonable enough that Bob might accept it outright, saving us both from further inflation losses."
