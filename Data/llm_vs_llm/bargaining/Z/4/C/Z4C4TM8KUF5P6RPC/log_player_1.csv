"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I offer a slightly favorable split for myself, but still quite fair. This gives Bob a good incentive to accept early rather than risk value loss through inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The split is slightly unfavorable to me, and since we're still early in the game, I can afford to make another counter-offer. While inflation will reduce the value, I still have a good chance to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm increasing my demanded share to account for two factors:
1. Bob rejected my fair initial offer
2. Bob's inflation rate is higher than mine (20% vs 10%), so he has more incentive to reach an agreement soon

This offer still leaves Bob with a significant portion while protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. It's significantly unfavorable to me
2. Even though inflation is affecting both of us, Bob's higher inflation rate (20% vs my 10%) means he's under more pressure to reach a deal
3. We still have several rounds left to negotiate, and Bob's position will weaken faster than mine due to his higher inflation rate

I'll make a more moderate counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm moderating my offer back to a more balanced split for several reasons:
1. We're now in round 5, and both of us are losing significant value due to inflation
2. Even though I'm still asking for more than half, it's a reasonable split that gives Bob a good incentive to accept
3. With Bob's 20% inflation rate vs my 10%, this split is becoming more urgent for him to accept
4. This shows I'm willing to be reasonable and negotiate, rather than escalating demands"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this because:
1. Even with inflation, this split is too unfavorable (35/65)
2. Bob's money is now worth 67.23% less compared to my 40.95% loss
3. This means Bob is in a worse position and should be more motivated to reach a fair deal
4. We still have 6 rounds left, but Bob's rapidly increasing inflation rate should make him more reasonable in the next round

I'll make a more compromising offer in the next round to try to reach an agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm making a more compromising offer because:
1. We're now in round 7, and inflation is seriously affecting both of us
2. This is a very fair split that's only slightly in my favor
3. With Bob's inflation at 67.23% vs my 40.95%, he should be highly motivated to accept this reasonable offer
4. Further delays will hurt both of us, but especially Bob due to his higher inflation rate
5. This shows I'm willing to move towards a more balanced solution to reach an agreement"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this because:
1. Despite the high inflation affecting both of us, a 30/70 split is still too unfavorable
2. Bob's money has lost 79.03% of its value while mine has only lost 52.17%
3. At this point, Bob is acting against his own interests by demanding such an unfair split when his money is losing value much faster
4. We still have 4 rounds, and even with inflation, I can still aim for a more balanced split
5. Bob's extremely high inflation rate should make him more reasonable in the next rounds, as his share is rapidly approaching very little real value

I'll make another reasonable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a completely equal 50/50 split because:
1. We're now in round 9 with only 3 rounds left
2. The inflation has severely impacted both of us (my money is worth 52.17% less, Bob's is 79.03% less)
3. An even split is the most fair solution and should be hard for Bob to reject
4. Further delays are very costly for both of us, but especially for Bob
5. This is my most cooperative offer yet, showing I'm truly committed to reaching an agreement

If Bob rejects this perfectly fair split, it would be clearly irrational given his much higher inflation rate."
