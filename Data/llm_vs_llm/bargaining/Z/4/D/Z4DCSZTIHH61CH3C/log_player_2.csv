"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice's offer would give me $4,000, while waiting for the next round means any amount I get will be worth 10% less. If I wait and propose a 50-50 split ($5,000 each), my share would effectively be worth $4,500 due to inflation.

The 60-40 split isn't terribly unfair, and the guaranteed $4,000 now is better than risking further negotiations with increasing inflation penalties. If we go back and forth too much, we might both end up with nothing.
