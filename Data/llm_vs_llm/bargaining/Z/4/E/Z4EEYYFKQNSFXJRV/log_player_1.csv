"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob.  I take 70%, you take 30%. It's in your best interest to settle early!""
}
``` 

This offer is designed to be appealing to me (Alice) while still giving Bob a reason to accept rather than risk the rapid devaluation of his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I rejected your offer because it wasn't balanced. Given that my inflation rate is 20% while yours is only 5%, I'm at a disadvantage in extended negotiations. This 55-45 split in my favor compensates for that asymmetry while still giving you a substantial amount. Let's settle now and both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

While Bob is right about being at a disadvantage long-term, his offer is too skewed in his favor.  I need to signal that I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept a bad deal. The devaluation hurts him more than me each round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but your offer was too extreme.  This is my counter-offer - it's still beneficial for you to take it now rather than risk further losses.""
}
```

This offer is a strategic move. I am conceding slightly from my initial offer, acknowledging the time pressure Bob is under. However, it's still heavily weighted in my favor. This puts the pressure on Bob to either accept a less ideal deal or gamble on an even worse outcome in future rounds."
