"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob.  I take 70%, you take 30%. It's in your best interest to settle early! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully considering the inflation rates.

If I reject, in the next round I can make a counter-offer, but the total money will be worth 20% less to me and 5% less to Alice. That means the 1,000,000 would be effectively worth 800,000 to me and 950,000 to Alice in the next round.

Alice's current offer gives me 300,000, which is less than what I could potentially get with a fair split, even accounting for inflation. With the significant difference in our inflation rates, I should make a counter-offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable counter-offer that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since my money loses value faster (20% per round) compared to Alice's (5% per round), I should propose a division that reflects this disadvantage while still being attractive to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I rejected your offer because it wasn't balanced. Given that my inflation rate is 20% while yours is only 5%, I'm at a disadvantage in extended negotiations. This 55-45 split in my favor compensates for that asymmetry while still giving you a substantial amount. Let's settle now and both benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but your offer was too extreme.  This is my counter-offer - it's still beneficial for you to take it now rather than risk further losses. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer considering the increasing inflation effects.

If I reject and we go to round 4, the money would be worth 48.8% less to me (20% + 20% + 20% compounded) and only 14.26% less to Alice (5% + 5% + 5% compounded). This significant difference makes extending negotiations increasingly costly for me.

Alice has improved her offer from 300,000 to 350,000 for me. While this is still less than what I proposed, the rapid inflation rate for my share makes accepting more attractive than continuing to negotiate.

The 350,000 offered now is worth more than what I might get in future rounds after accounting for my higher inflation rate. I should accept this offer rather than risk further depreciation of my share.
