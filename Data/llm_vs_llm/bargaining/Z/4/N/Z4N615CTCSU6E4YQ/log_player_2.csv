"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money 60-40 in my favor. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can end the game quickly before inflation affects our shares too much. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 60-40 split in her favor, where I would get $400,000 and she would get $600,000.

If I reject and we go to the next round, I'll make a counter-offer, but the total value will decrease by 10% for me and 5% for Alice. That means the total would be worth $900,000 to me and $950,000 to her.

Given the significant inflation penalty for me (10% per round versus Alice's 5%), there's a strategic disadvantage to prolonging the game. While a 50-50 split might seem more fair, the inflation difference means Alice has more leverage.

The $400,000 now is worth more than potentially getting a slightly larger amount in future rounds after the inflation penalty.
