# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I propose an even split of $50 for each of us. This way, we both get an equal share and avoid any future inflation losses.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your competitive spirit. To keep things moving and to minimize further inflation losses on my end, I propose a division where you receive $52 and I get $48. This deal gives you a slightly larger share than an even split, and it secures both our interests before any additional devaluation. I believe this timely agreement benefits us both. What do you think?""}"
