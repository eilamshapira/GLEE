"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $55 and you receive $45. Accepting now avoids any inflation loss on my side and ensures we both get a fair, immediate division of the money. What do you think?

# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50,""alice_gain"": 50,""message"": ""Hi Alice, I propose an even split of $50 for each of us. This way, we both get an equal share and avoid any future inflation losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your competitive spirit. To keep things moving and to minimize further inflation losses on my end, I propose a division where you receive $52 and I get $48. This deal gives you a slightly larger share than an even split, and it secures both our interests before any additional devaluation. I believe this timely agreement benefits us both. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
