"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to avoid the 20% inflation penalty that will affect me in the next round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor.  This is a fairer split as I'm taking on the risk of potential inflation in the next round.  Let's be reasonable and reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:

1. Due to 20% inflation, if I accept now, my $450,000 is actually worth $360,000 (450000 * 0.8)
2. If I reject and we go to the next round, any amount I get will be worth even less (another 20% reduction)
3. In the first round, I proposed getting $600,000, but Bob rejected
4. Bob's current offer of $450,000 (worth $360,000 to me) is significantly less than what I initially wanted
5. However, if I reject, we'll move to another round where my money will be worth even less, and Bob might propose an even less favorable split

Given the significant inflation penalty I'm facing and the risk of getting an even worse deal in the next round, I should accept this offer.
