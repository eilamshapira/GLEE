"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's aim for a fair compromise. I value this partnership, and a slightly better split for me this round will help us both move forward. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of $4,500 for me and $5,500 for him. While it's not the most favorable split for me, it's a reasonable compromise and allows us to conclude the negotiation efficiently rather than potentially losing more in further rounds."
