"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but that's a bit too much for me.  How about a 55/45 split in my favor?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about we meet in the middle? I get 55, you get 45. This seems fairer given the inflation affecting Bob. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a tough one, and getting close to crunch time! While the deal is getting better, I'm still losing out significantly due to the inflation.  Alice is using the inflation against me, but it might be a bluff.  I'm willing to gamble a bit longer for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's stop this back and forth.  We're getting dangerously close to losing it all.  I propose a 50/50 split.  It's fair, and we both avoid getting burned by the inflation any further.""}"
