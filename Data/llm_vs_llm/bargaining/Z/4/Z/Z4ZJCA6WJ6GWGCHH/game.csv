400.0,9600.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I take $400 and you get $9600. Given that delaying even one round cuts the real value of money by 10% for me and 5% for you, accepting now nets you $9600 in full value—more than you’d expect if you waited to propose in the next round. I believe this is a fair offer to avoid further losses from inflation, so let’s settle it quickly.",Alice,1,

300.0,9700.0,"Hi Alice, I've considered your offer, but I think I can do better. Given the inflation rates, I'm willing to take $9700 and offer you $300. This way, we both get something, and I'm still being generous considering the next round would cut the value even further for you. Let's settle this now.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but I'll have to pass on this offer. Given the structure of the game and the inflation penalty hitting me more steeply, I believe I can secure a more favorable division in the next round. Let's move on to round 3.",Alice,2,reject
350.0,9650.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 3: I take $350 and you receive $9650. Remember, every round we wait further, the real value of our shares declines—my share by 10% and yours by 5% per round relative to round 1. Given that in round 4 your proposal would be subject to even steeper inflation (roughly a 14% reduction in your effective value compared to round 1), accepting this offer secures you a higher effective value. I believe this split reflects the diminishing returns both of us face as time passes, so let's settle now before the discount bites any deeper.",Alice,3,

250.0,9750.0,"Hi Alice, I've thought about your offer, but I still think I can get a better deal. Considering the inflation, my share is now worth 14.25% less than the initial value, and yours is worth 28.1% less. Given this, I'm willing to offer you $250, and I'll take $9750. This is a fair split, as I'm still giving you a significant amount despite the decreasing value. Let's settle this before it's too late.",Bob,4,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I don't think it's the best for me. I believe that by moving into the next round, I can propose a split that gives me a bit more value—even considering the further discount—which should still leave you with a significant share. Let’s continue to round 5 and try to reach a fair compromise before the value diminishes even further.",Alice,4,reject
3450.0,6550.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 5. With the inflation factors now, my money is worth 0.9⁴ = 0.6561 of its original value and yours 0.95⁴ = 0.8145. If you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 6 and—using the standard bargaining logic—you can secure an effective value of roughly $5337 (since as proposer in round 6 you’d get about 69% of the discounted $10000, with your discount factor then being 0.95⁵ ≈ 0.7738). To give you no less than that in today’s round, I’m offering you a nominal $6550, which translates to an effective value of about $6550 × 0.8145 ≈ $5341. Meanwhile, I would receive $3450 nominally, which at my multiplier is $3450 × 0.6561 ≈ $2264. This offer leaves you essentially as well off as waiting—but avoids further devaluation—and thus should be fair to both of us given the circumstances. I hope you agree so we can settle before the value drops even further.",Alice,5,
