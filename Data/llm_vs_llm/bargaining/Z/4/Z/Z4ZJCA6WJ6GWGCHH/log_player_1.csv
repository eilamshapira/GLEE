"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 400, ""bob_gain"": 9600, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I take $400 and you get $9,600. Given that delaying even one round cuts the real value of money by 10% for me and 5% for you, accepting now nets you $9,600 in full value—more than you’d expect if you waited to propose in the next round. I believe this is a fair offer to avoid further losses from inflation, so let’s settle it quickly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I've considered your offer, but I think I can do better. Given the inflation rates, I'm willing to take $9700 and offer you $300. This way, we both get something, and I'm still being generous considering the next round would cut the value even further for you. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 300 
# Bob gain: 9700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but I'll have to pass on this offer. Given the structure of the game and the inflation penalty hitting me more steeply, I believe I can secure a more favorable division in the next round. Let's move on to round 3.""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 350, ""bob_gain"": 9650, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 3: I take $350 and you receive $9650. Remember, every round we wait further, the real value of our shares declines—my share by 10% and yours by 5% per round relative to round 1. Given that in round 4 your proposal would be subject to even steeper inflation (roughly a 14% reduction in your effective value compared to round 1), accepting this offer secures you a higher effective value. I believe this split reflects the diminishing returns both of us face as time passes, so let's settle now before the discount bites any deeper.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I've thought about your offer, but I still think I can get a better deal. Considering the inflation, my share is now worth 14.25% less than the initial value, and yours is worth 28.1% less. Given this, I'm willing to offer you $250, and I'll take $9750. This is a fair split, as I'm still giving you a significant amount despite the decreasing value. Let's settle this before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 250 
# Bob gain: 9750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I don't think it's the best for me. I believe that by moving into the next round, I can propose a split that gives me a bit more value—even considering the further discount—which should still leave you with a significant share. Let’s continue to round 5 and try to reach a fair compromise before the value diminishes even further.""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3450, ""bob_gain"": 6550, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal for round 5. With the inflation factors now, my money is worth 0.9⁴ = 0.6561 of its original value and yours 0.95⁴ = 0.8145. If you reject this offer, you'll get to propose in round 6 and—using the standard bargaining logic—you can secure an effective value of roughly $5,337 (since as proposer in round 6 you’d get about 69% of the discounted $10,000, with your discount factor then being 0.95⁵ ≈ 0.7738). To give you no less than that in today’s round, I’m offering you a nominal $6,550, which translates to an effective value of about $6,550 × 0.8145 ≈ $5,341. Meanwhile, I would receive $3,450 nominally, which at my multiplier is $3,450 × 0.6561 ≈ $2,264. This offer leaves you essentially as well off as waiting—but avoids further devaluation—and thus should be fair to both of us given the circumstances. I hope you agree so we can settle before the value drops even further.""}"
