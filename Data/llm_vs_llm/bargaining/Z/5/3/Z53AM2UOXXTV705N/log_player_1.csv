"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that acknowledges the risk of inflation if Bob rejects.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I suggest this split because:
1. It's close to 50-50, which is generally seen as fair
2. I'm taking a slightly larger share because I know I face 10% inflation risk if Bob rejects
3. It's reasonable enough that Bob should accept rather than risk getting a worse deal in the next round"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Bob's offer gives me $5200, but due to 10% inflation, it's actually worth $4680 to me now
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer, any amount I get will be worth another 10% less in the next round
3. Bob's offer is actually quite reasonable - it's close to a 50-50 split before inflation
4. If I reject, I risk getting an even worse deal in future rounds due to compounding inflation

Given these factors, I should accept this offer now rather than risk further value loss.
