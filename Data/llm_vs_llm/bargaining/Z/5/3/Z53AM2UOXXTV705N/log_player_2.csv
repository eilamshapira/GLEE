"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer. 

Alice is proposing I get $4500 while she gets $5500. While this isn't a 50-50 split, it's still a substantial amount. Since there's no inflation effect for me, I don't lose value by accepting now. However, I could try to negotiate for a more equal split by rejecting and making a counter-offer.

Given that I don't know Alice's inflation rate, and $4500 is still a good amount (45% of the total), I'll reject this offer to try for a better split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still giving Alice a slightly larger share to increase the chances she'll accept:

{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200}

This is a more balanced offer that gives me a fair share while still being generous enough to Alice that she might accept. Since there's no inflation affecting me, I can afford to be somewhat accommodating while still improving my position from her initial offer."
