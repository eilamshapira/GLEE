Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since every round incurs a 20% depreciation for the funds I receive, it's important we settle soon. I propose a split of $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This cut secures us both a deal immediately, avoiding further devaluation. Looking forward to your swift agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
