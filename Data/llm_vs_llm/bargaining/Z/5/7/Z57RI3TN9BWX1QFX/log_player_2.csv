Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, since every round incurs a 20% depreciation for the funds I receive, it's important we settle soon. I propose a split of $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This cut secures us both a deal immediately, avoiding further devaluation. Looking forward to your swift agreement.""}"
