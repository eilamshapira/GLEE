"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that gives both of us a good share while being slightly in my favor.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because it's relatively fair while giving me a small advantage as the first mover. This way, Bob gets a substantial amount that should be appealing enough to accept, while I maintain a slight edge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob's actual value due to 10% inflation: 5500 * 0.9 = 4950
2. My offered value: 4500 (no inflation impact for me)
3. If I reject, we move to round 3 where I can make another offer, but Bob's value will decrease further

Given that:
- The difference between our gains isn't too large
- We're still early in the game but inflation is already affecting Bob's value
- I can get a guaranteed $4500 now
- Further rounds will only decrease the total value we can split
- There's a risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
