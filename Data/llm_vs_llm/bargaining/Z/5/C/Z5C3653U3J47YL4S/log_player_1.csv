"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I want to secure a good outcome for myself, but also ensure Bob accepts the offer to avoid losing everything. Given it's the first round, I'll propose a relatively fair split.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my initial offer. Now he's offering me $450,000. I still have 11 rounds left. I think I can do better.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I rejected Bob's offer. Now it's my turn again. I need to make an offer that's tempting enough for Bob to accept, but still favors me. Since Bob rejected a near 50/50 split, I'll adjust slightly in his favor.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob rejected my last offer. He's now offering $460,000. This is still not ideal. I'm going to reject, hoping to get a better offer later, but I need to be careful as we're burning through rounds.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alright, Bob has rejected two of my offers now. He seems determined to get more than half. I'll sweeten the deal for him, but still try to maintain a slight advantage.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 530000,
  ""bob_gain"": 470000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 470000 
# Bob gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob rejected my offer again, and now he's offering me $470,000. We are halfway through the rounds. I think I will accept this offer.

""decision"": ""accept""
