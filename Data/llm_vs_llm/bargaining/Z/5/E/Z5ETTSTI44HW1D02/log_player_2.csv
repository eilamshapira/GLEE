"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Even with inflation, accepting $4,500 now is barely better than getting $4,000 in the first round. I need to hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200} 

This is a risky move as the value is decreasing rapidly for me, but I need to aim high to offset potential further losses from inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, and this offer is barely acceptable considering the circumstances. If I reject it, I risk getting even less in the next round."
