Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to pressure me with the inflation rate, but her offer is still too low. I need to remain firm and aim for a better split."

# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a fair deal.  This offer reflects the time pressure we're both under. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is the same offer I made in round 2, and though it's not ideal considering inflation, it's better to take it now before my position weakens further.  A deal now is better than risking getting nothing at all."
