"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this offer carefully. Alice is offering a 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, with each of us getting $500,000.

Given that inflation affects Alice but not me, I have a strategic advantage by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round. If we move to round 2, the $1,000,000 will still be worth $1,000,000 to me, but it will be worth 10% less to Alice (only $900,000 in value to her).

This means I could potentially propose a more favorable split for myself in the next round, and it might still be rational for Alice to accept.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Alice's 50-50 split, I'll now make a counter-offer that accounts for the inflation differential between us. The money has lost 10% of its value for Alice, so she's now essentially valuing the total pot at $900,000.

I'll offer a split that gives Alice slightly more than what would be equivalent to half of her perceived value ($450,000), while allowing me to gain more than the initial 50-50 split.

{""bob_gain"": 530000, 
""alice_gain"": 470000}

I'm offering this split because it gives Alice 52.2% of what she currently values the pot at ($470,000 of her perceived $900,000 value), which is actually better for her than a 50-50 split of her perceived value. Meanwhile, I get a larger portion of the actual amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully analyze Alice's new offer.

Alice is offering me $550,000 and keeping $450,000 for herself. The money maintains full value for me, while for Alice, the $450,000 is worth only 81% of its original value (due to the 19% cumulative inflation she experiences).

If I reject this offer and we move to round 4, Alice will face even more inflation (about 27% total), making the money worth even less to her. This gives me potential leverage for the next round.

However, this current offer is already quite favorable to me - I'm getting 55% of the total amount, which is better than the initial 50-50 split Alice proposed. If we continue to round 4, there's risk that Alice might be less generous if she feels I'm being too aggressive.

Given that this is a significant improvement from the first offer and represents a reasonable split considering our different inflation rates, I'll accept.
