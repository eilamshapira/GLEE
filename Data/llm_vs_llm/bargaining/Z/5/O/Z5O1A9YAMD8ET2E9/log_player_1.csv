"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that recognizes both the inflation pressure on me and the need to make a fair proposal to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

I suggest this division as it's close to fair while giving me a slight advantage in the first round. With 20% inflation affecting me each round, it's important to reach an agreement quickly, but I also want to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer gives me significantly less than what I proposed, and while I understand inflation is affecting us both (though at different rates), I believe we can reach a more balanced agreement in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to consider the increasing inflation pressure while still trying to reach a fair agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even split this round. Given that inflation affects me more strongly (20% per round vs Bob's 5%), it's important that we reach an agreement quickly. This equal division represents a compromise from my initial position and should appear fair to Bob."
