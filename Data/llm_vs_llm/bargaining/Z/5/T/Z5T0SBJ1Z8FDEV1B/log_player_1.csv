"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, 55/45 is fairer 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $450,000, which is worth 5% less than its original value. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. For me, it's worth 5% less than in Round 2, which means it's 10% less than the original value (1 - 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.0975). For Bob, it's worth 20% less than in Round 2, which means it's 36% less than the original value (1 - 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.36).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""My last reasonable offer, consider the inflation""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation hurts me more, need a better split 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $420,000, which is worth 14.26% less than its original value. This is a relatively low amount, but I also need to consider that the money will be worth even less in the next round.
