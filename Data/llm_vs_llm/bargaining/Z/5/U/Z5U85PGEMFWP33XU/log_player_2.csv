"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer by considering our options.

Alice is offering me $40 out of $100, keeping $60 for herself. Since inflation doesn't affect me (worth 0% less each round for me), my $40 would maintain its value. For Alice, her money loses 10% value each round.

If I reject now, I can make a counter-offer next round. Given Alice faces inflation, she has some incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

Since we have many rounds left and I can potentially negotiate for more, I'll reject this initial offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a slightly more favorable offer to myself while still being reasonable to Alice, considering she faces 10% inflation per round.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I suggest this split because it gives me more than the initial offer while still providing Alice with a substantial amount. Since she faces inflation in future rounds, accepting now would be in her interest rather than dragging negotiations further where her potential gain would diminish in value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's revised offer.

Alice is now offering me $45 out of $100, which is an improvement from her initial offer of $40. Since inflation doesn't affect me, this $45 maintains its full value.

For Alice, due to the 19% inflation she's experienced, the $55 she's keeping is worth less than it would have been in round 1. This explains why she's willing to offer me more now.

I need to decide whether to accept this improved offer or continue negotiating. If I reject, I can make another offer in round 4, potentially asking for more. However, Alice may reject again, and we'd continue this back-and-forth with her facing increasing inflation pressure.

Since Alice has moved significantly from her initial position and I still have leverage due to inflation affecting only her, I'll reject this offer to try for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a slightly improved offer that takes into account the inflation pressure Alice faces while trying to reach a fair agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

This offer gives me a bit more than my previous one while still giving Alice a substantial portion. Since Alice now faces approximately 27% inflation in the next round if she rejects, accepting $40 now would be more valuable to her than potentially receiving less value after more rounds of inflation. I'm trying to balance maximizing my gain while providing enough incentive for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's new 50-50 offer.

Alice is now offering me $50 out of $100, which is a further improvement from her previous offers of $40 and then $45. Since inflation doesn't affect me, this $50 maintains its full value.

For Alice, the inflation has increased to 34.39% since round 1, making her $50 worth significantly less than it would have been initially. This explains her willingness to move to an even split.

If I reject this offer:
- I can make another counteroffer in round 6
- Alice will face even higher inflation (approximately 41% by round 7)
- We're approaching the midpoint of our 12 available rounds

A 50-50 split is objectively fair in absolute terms, though I do have a negotiating advantage due to inflation only affecting Alice. However, pushing too hard might lead to no agreement within our 12 rounds.

Given the significant improvement in the offer and the fair split, I'll accept this offer.
