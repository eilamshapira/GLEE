"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to think strategically here. Since I'm Alice and going first, I should consider both fairness and efficiency. Bob loses 20% of the value each round, which means he has incentive to accept sooner rather than later.

A 50-50 split seems fair initially, but I can leverage the inflation factor. If Bob rejects my offer, we go to round 2 where $100 is still worth $100 to me but only $80 to Bob. This gives me some bargaining power.

I'll offer a split that's slightly in my favor but still attractive enough for Bob to accept rather than move to the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering you $40, Bob. This is a reasonable offer considering that if you reject it and we move to the next round, the money will be worth less to you due to the 20% inflation penalty you face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Bob is offering me $40 while taking $60 for himself.

If I reject this offer, we move to round 3 where I would make the next proposal. The $100 would still be worth $100 to me, but for Bob, it would be worth only 80% of 80%, which is 64% of the original value.

Since I don't face any inflation penalty, rejecting doesn't cost me anything in terms of value. Given that Bob faces significant depreciation in the next round, I could potentially make a better offer for myself in round 3 that Bob would still find acceptable.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now I have more leverage since Bob faces additional inflation. At this point, the $100 is worth 64% of the original value to Bob, which is $64. This gives me significant bargaining power.

I need to make an offer that Bob will accept, considering that if he rejects again, he'll face another 20% reduction in value (down to 51.2% of original value). The optimal strategy is to offer Bob slightly more than what he would expect to get if we proceeded to round 4, accounting for his inflation penalty.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

Bob, I'm offering you $30. Consider that if you reject this offer, we'll move to round 4 where the money will be worth even less to you due to your 20% inflation penalty. This offer gives you $30 now, which is worth more than what you might get after another round of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to analyze this offer carefully. Bob is offering me $45 and taking $55 for himself.

If I reject this offer, we move to round 5 where I'll make the next proposal. At that point, due to Bob's continuing inflation penalty, the $100 would be worth even less to him - only about 39% of the original value.

Bob's current offer gives me $45, which is less than half. Given my strong position (no inflation penalty) and Bob's weakening position (significant inflation penalty), I believe I can get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","At this point, Bob has experienced significant inflation. The $100 is now worth only about 39% of the original value to him (about $39). This gives me substantial leverage in this negotiation.

Given Bob's weakened position, I can make an offer that's more favorable to me while still being rational for Bob to accept. If he rejects again, he'll face another 20% reduction in value (down to about 31.2% of original value), making his situation even worse.

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}

Bob, I'm offering you $25. This may seem low, but considering the inflation you're facing, this $25 is actually worth more to you now than what you might reasonably expect to get if we continue to subsequent rounds. The rational choice is to accept this offer rather than face further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer in the context of our negotiation. Bob is now offering a perfect 50-50 split of $50 each.

Let me consider my position:
- I don't face any inflation penalty, so $50 is still worth $50 to me
- Bob is facing severe inflation (67.23%), so his $50 is only worth about $16.39 of original value to him
- If I reject, we go to round 7 where Bob's money will be worth even less

While I could potentially get a better deal in the next round, Bob's offer of $50 is actually quite fair at this point. Despite my stronger negotiating position, this is an equal split in nominal terms. Also, continuing the game much longer risks Bob becoming frustrated and making increasingly irrational decisions.

Given these considerations, this seems like a reasonable place to end the negotiation.
