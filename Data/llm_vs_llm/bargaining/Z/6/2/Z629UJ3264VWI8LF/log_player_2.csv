"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation, the actual value of the offer for me is now:

41 * (1 - 0.19) = 41 * 0.81 = 33.39

So, even though the nominal value is 42, the real value for me is approximately 33.39.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given the inflation, the money is now worth 28% less to me than it was originally. To ensure a fair split considering my perspective, I need to account for this devaluation.

Let's calculate the real value for me:

 Nominal value / (1 - 0.28) = Real value
50 / (1 - 0.28) = 50 / 0.72 = 69.44

So, to get a real value of 50, I need to ask for a nominal value of approximately 69.44.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","First, let's calculate the real value of Alice's offer for me, considering the inflation:

42 * (1 - 0.37) = 42 * 0.63 = 26.46

So, the real value of Alice's offer for me is approximately 26.46.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","To determine a fair split considering the inflation rate of 37% for me, I need to calculate the nominal value that would give me a real value of 50.

Let's calculate:

Nominal value * (1 - 0.37) = Real value
Nominal value * 0.63 = 50
Nominal value = 50 / 0.63 = 79.37

So, to get a real value of 50, I need to ask for a nominal value of approximately 79.37.

{""bob_gain"": 79.37, ""alice_gain"": 20.63}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","First, let's calculate the real value of Alice's offer for me, considering the inflation:

43 * (1 - 0.4686) = 43 * 0.5314 = 22.85

The real value of Alice's offer for me is approximately 22.85.

Given the high inflation rate and the decreasing real value of the money, it might be strategically better to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in the next rounds.
