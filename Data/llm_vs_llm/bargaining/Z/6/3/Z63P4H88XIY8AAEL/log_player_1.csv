"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I want to make a fair offer considering the different inflation rates that affect both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

I suggest I get $5,500 and you get $4,500. This is slightly in my favor but considering that inflation affects me more harshly (20% vs your 5%), I think this is reasonable. If we move to later rounds, I'll lose more value than you will."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Given the inflation rates, I need to be strategic about my offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split of $5,000 each. This is a fair compromise considering we've already gone through two rounds. If we continue further, the money will be worth significantly less to me due to my higher inflation rate (20% vs your 5%). At this point, my $5,000 is already worth only 64% of the original value, while your $5,000 would be worth 90.25% of the original value. This is a fair middle ground between our initial positions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","At this point, inflation has significantly decreased the value of the money for me, so I need to adjust my strategy.

{""alice_gain"": 4200, 
""bob_gain"": 5800}

I'm proposing I get $4,200 and you get $5,800. This is a concession from my previous offers, recognizing that after 5 rounds, my inflation rate of 20% per round has seriously eroded my potential gains. For me, this money is now worth only about 41% of the original value, while for you it's still worth over 85% of the original value. This offer gives you the larger share while still keeping the division reasonable for me given our different inflation rates."
