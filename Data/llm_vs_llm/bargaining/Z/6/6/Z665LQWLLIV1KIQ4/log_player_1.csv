Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a fair split considering the time pressure and inflation factor.

""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's be efficient. I'm offering a slightly higher amount for myself since I lose 10% value each round, but it's still quite fair. We should try to resolve this quickly to maximize value for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's keep it simple and fair with an equal split. This way, we both gain equally and quickly, minimizing any loss from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
