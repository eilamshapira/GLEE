"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob. A slight advantage for me considering potential future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer considering the inflation aspect.

Alice is offering me $450,000 out of the $1,000,000, while she takes $550,000. If I reject, we go to the next round where I can make a counter-offer, but the total money will be worth 10% less to me (effectively $900,000 from my perspective).

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, I'd need to offer Alice enough to make her accept, while maximizing my own gain. However, with the 10% inflation penalty, I'd need to secure significantly more than $450,000 in the next round to make rejection worthwhile.

Given that this is a fair initial offer that gives me 45% of the total, and considering the inflation risk, I'll accept.
