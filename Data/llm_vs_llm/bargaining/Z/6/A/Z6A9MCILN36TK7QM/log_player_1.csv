"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me propose a fair division that acknowledges both our interests.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial amount, with a slight advantage to me as the first mover. If Bob rejects this offer, we'll both lose value due to the 5% inflation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's less favorable than my initial proposal, it's still a good deal considering:
1. The 5% inflation means delaying further would reduce the real value of any future agreement
2. The split is still reasonably fair (45/55)
3. $450,000 is a substantial amount

It's better to secure this deal now than risk further value loss through continued negotiation."
