"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this carefully:

1. The offer is $400,000 for me and $600,000 for Alice
2. If I reject and wait for next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me
3. If I wait one round, my $400,000 would effectively be worth $360,000
4. This is a decent first offer - I get 40% of the total
5. Waiting could be risky as Alice might offer less in future rounds
6. Each round I wait reduces my purchasing power

Given that this is a reasonable first offer and waiting would definitely cost me 10% value, I'll accept.
