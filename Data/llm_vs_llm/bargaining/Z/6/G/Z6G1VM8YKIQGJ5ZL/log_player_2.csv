"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has not decreased yet. I want at least half.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's think about this. The money is now worth 19% less. My potential gain of $43 is worth $43 * (1 - 0.19) = $43 * 0.81 = $34.83 in the original value.

While not ideal, accepting guarantees me $34.83 in original value. Rejecting risks further inflation and a potentially worse offer. I will take the bird in hand.
