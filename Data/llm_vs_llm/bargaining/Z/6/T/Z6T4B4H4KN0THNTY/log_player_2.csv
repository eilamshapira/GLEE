# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is hurting me. I'm willing to take slightly more to compensate for my losses. Let's agree on this before we both lose more!

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 36, ""alice_gain"": 64, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your struggle with inflation. To help you mitigate further losses, I’m offering you $64 while I take $36. In today’s terms that means you receive about $51.8 of real value—slightly more than what you’d effectively get with your last offer. Let’s settle now before further rounds depreciate your share even more.""}"
