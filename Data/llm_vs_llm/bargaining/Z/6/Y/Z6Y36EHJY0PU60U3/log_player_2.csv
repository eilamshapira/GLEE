"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering we both need to come to an agreement quickly to avoid inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Current offer is $40 for me and $60 for Alice
2. If I reject, next round I can make an offer, but:
   - The money will be worth 20% less to me (so $100 will be worth $80)
   - I don't know how inflation affects Alice
3. Even if I make a better proposal next round, Alice might reject it, leading to further rounds and more inflation

Given that:
- $40 now is better than a larger share of a depreciated amount later
- The risk of multiple rounds making the money worth much less
- Alice's offer is somewhat reasonable (not extremely unfair)
