"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1, aiming for a fair and acceptable split given the constraints:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

My reasoning: I'm asking for slightly more than half to account for the fact that inflation hits me harder (10% vs Bob's 5%).  This should still be attractive to Bob as he gets a substantial amount, and hopefully avoids a lengthy negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer in Round 2. He's offering me $4800, and keeping $5200 for himself. Taking into account the inflation, $4800 now is worth $4800 * 0.9 = $4320 in round 1 money. Similarly, $5200 for Bob is worth $5200 * 0.95 = $4940 in round 1 money.

I need to decide if getting $4320 (in round 1 terms) is better than risking further inflation and potentially getting nothing. It's tempting to reject and make a counter-offer where I get more. However, the risk of the money dwindling away is significant.

Given the information, I will accept.
