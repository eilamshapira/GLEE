"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. 

Alice is offering me 4500$ while taking 5500$ for herself. While this isn't an even split, it's not terribly unfair. If I reject:
1. The money will be worth 5% less to me next round
2. I can make a counter-offer, but Alice may reject it
3. Her loss to inflation is higher (10% per round), which gives me some leverage

The maximum value I can get now is 4500$. If I reject and propose next round, even if I ask for more, it will be worth less due to inflation.

Given this is just the first round and the split isn't too uneven, I think I can negotiate for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I should propose something that's both appealing to Alice while being better for me than her initial offer. Given that:

1. Alice loses 10% value per round vs my 5%
2. She's shown willingness to consider uneven splits
3. We need to reach agreement to avoid both getting nothing

I'll propose a more balanced split, slightly in my favor:

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}

I think this is fair because:
- It's not too far from an even split
- Given inflation affects Alice more, she has more incentive to accept now
- It's better for her than waiting another round where her value would decrease by 10%"
