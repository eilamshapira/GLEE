"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully.

Alice is offering me $40 while she gets $60. With inflation, Alice's money loses 10% of its value each round, but my money keeps its value. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, Alice would need to consider that $60 in this round is worth more to her than $60 in the next round.

Since we have 12 rounds total and I can make a better offer next round, I'll reject this one.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's money loses 10% of its value each round, I can use this as leverage for a more favorable split. I'll offer a more balanced division that accounts for the time pressure Alice faces.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an even split of the money. This is fair and reasonable, especially considering that any delay impacts Alice more than me due to the 10% inflation she faces. Each round we delay, Alice's potential gain decreases in value for her, while mine remains the same."
