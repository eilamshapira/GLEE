"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob. Given that we're dividing $100 and inflation will reduce the value by 10% each round if we don't reach an agreement, I should propose a fair split that Bob would likely accept.

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing an equal 50-50 split of the $100. This is fair and reasonable, giving us both the same amount. Since inflation will reduce the value of the money with each passing round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly."
