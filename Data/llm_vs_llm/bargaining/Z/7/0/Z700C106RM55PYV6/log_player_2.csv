"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer considering the information provided.

Alice is offering an equal split of the $100, giving me $50 and keeping $50 for herself. This is a fair division.

I should note that there's no inflation for me according to the rules (the money is worth 0% less for me with each passing round), so there's no penalty for me to reject and continue to the next round where I could potentially make a better offer.

However, a 50-50 split is considered fair in most negotiation contexts, and there's uncertainty about how inflation might affect Alice, which could influence her future decisions.
