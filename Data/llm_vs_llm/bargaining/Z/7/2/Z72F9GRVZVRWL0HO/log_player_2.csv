"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Alice's offer gives her a larger share of the $1,000,000. Given that I face 10% inflation per round, I should carefully consider whether waiting for a better deal is worth the loss in value.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value to me will be worth 10% less. So even if I proposed a 50-50 split next round, my $500,000 would only be worth $450,000 to me due to inflation.

The $400,000 offered now is actually better than what I'd get after inflation if I wait a round to propose a more favorable split.
