"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider that when making my decision.

The original amount I would get is $400,000, but due to inflation, it's worth 5% less, so it's $400,000 * 0.95 = $380,000.

Considering this, I think I can get a better deal if I wait.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to make a more even split. Also, considering the inflation, I want to get a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, 
""bob_gain"": 350000, 
""message"": ""Let's aim for a more even split, considering the inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but let's aim for a split closer to 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10.25% less than in round 2 (5% less in round 2 and another 5% less in round 3, for a total of 10.25% less than round 1, and then another 4.01% less, for a total of 14.26% less), I need to consider that when making my decision.

The original amount I would get is $550,000, but due to inflation, it's worth $550,000 * 0.8574 = $471,570.

Considering this, and the fact that Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, I think this might be a reasonable deal.
