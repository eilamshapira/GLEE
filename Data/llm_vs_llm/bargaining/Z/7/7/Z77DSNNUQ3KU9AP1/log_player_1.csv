"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a balanced split that's slightly in my favor since I'm making the first move, but fair enough that Bob might accept to avoid inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This gives Bob a significant portion while leaving me with a slight advantage as the first mover."
