"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully since there's a 20% inflation penalty for me each round.

If I accept now, I get $45.
If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, we'd need to agree on at least $56.25 for me (since 45 รท 0.8 = 56.25) to break even with what I can get now.

The offer isn't perfectly even, but it's fairly reasonable, and the inflation risk for me is significant. If we keep negotiating, the total value keeps decreasing for me, which means we both might end up with less.
