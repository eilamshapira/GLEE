"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. The offer is a 50-50 split, which is traditionally considered fair. However, with the 20% inflation penalty per round, if I reject now, any future gains will be worth less to me. Even if I could negotiate a better split in the next round, I would lose 20% of whatever I get.

For example, if I managed to get $60 in the next round, it would only be worth $48 to me due to inflation, which is less than the $50 being offered now.

Given these conditions, I should accept this fair offer now rather than risk getting less value in future rounds due to inflation.
