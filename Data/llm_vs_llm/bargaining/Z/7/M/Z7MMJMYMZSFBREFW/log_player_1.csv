"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the effects of inflation. I need to decide whether to accept Bob's offer in round 2.

Given that my money is worth the same as in round 1 and Bob's is worth 20% less, I will **reject** this offer. I'm getting a small amount, and it's more beneficial for me to try to negotiate again, even if it means the total value of the money decreases overall.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for round 3, considering the inflation and the risk of getting nothing:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```"
