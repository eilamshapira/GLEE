Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposal and understand your perspective. However, with each additional round the total value decreases for me, so Iâ€™d like to avoid further delays. I propose a split where I receive $55 and you get $45. I believe this is a fair division given the circumstances, and I hope you agree to this prompt resolution.

# Bob gain: 55
