6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more to account for potential losses from inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Since you value the money 5% less this round (4500 now is worth about 4275 next round to you), this is a fair offer that benefits us both by concluding now. If we continue, you'll lose more value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"The value is decreasing for me each round, Bob.  Let's settle this fairly.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Consider this carefully: Due to inflation, if you reject this offer, your next round's money will be worth 20% less than round 1. 4000$ now is better than a larger number that's worth less later. Let's conclude this now.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, it's clear that dragging this out only hurts me. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Let's end this.",Alice,5,
