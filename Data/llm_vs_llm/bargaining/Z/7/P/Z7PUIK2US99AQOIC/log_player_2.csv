"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more to account for potential losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me 4000$ while taking 6000$ for herself. She mentions inflation, but that only affects her - for me, the money keeps its value in future rounds. 

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the 10000$ will only be worth 9500$ to her (5% less). This gives me negotiating leverage, as she's more motivated to avoid additional rounds.

Given this asymmetric inflation effect, I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making my own proposal next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice values the money 5% less this round, I'll propose a more favorable split for me while still giving her incentive to accept rather than risk another round where she'll lose more value.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Since you value the money 5% less this round (4500 now is worth about 4275 next round to you), this is a fair offer that benefits us both by concluding now. If we continue, you'll lose more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is decreasing for me each round, Bob.  Let's settle this fairly. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is offering me 4500$ (up from her initial 4000$)
2. The money's value continues to decrease for her, but not for me
3. If we go another round:
   - I could propose again
   - The money will be worth about 15% less to her
   - This gives me even more leverage

Her current offer still gives her the majority (5500$), even though she's the one affected by inflation. Since I'm not affected by inflation, I can afford to be patient and push for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that the money is now worth about 15% less to Alice than in round 1, and will be worth about 20% less next round, I can push for a more favorable split. She should be motivated to accept to avoid further value loss.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Consider this carefully: Due to inflation, if you reject this offer, your next round's money will be worth 20% less than round 1. 4000$ now is better than a larger number that's worth less later. Let's conclude this now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear that dragging this out only hurts me. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate this:

1. Alice is now offering a 50/50 split (5000$ each)
2. She's right that continuing hurts her more - her money is worth 18.55% less now
3. If I reject:
   - I could push for more in the next round
   - But she's made a significant concession from her initial position
   - The offer is fair and reasonable
   - There's also a risk she might become less cooperative if I appear too greedy

Given that she's moved from 6000/4000 to a perfectly equal split, and she's already taking a significant hit from inflation, this seems like a fair place to end the negotiation.
