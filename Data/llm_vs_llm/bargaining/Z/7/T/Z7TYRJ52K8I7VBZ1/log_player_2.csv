"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $100,000 while she keeps $900,000, which is a 10/90 split in her favor.

Given the 10% inflation per round, if I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value to me will only be $900,000. If we continue negotiating for multiple rounds, the value will decrease further.

This initial offer gives me just 10% of the total, which seems quite low. I should make a counter-offer that considers the inflation penalty while trying to get a fairer split.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer while acknowledging the inflation effect.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the money. This is a fair division that gives both of us the same amount. While I could ask for more to compensate for my inflation penalty, I believe starting with an even 50/50 split demonstrates good faith in our negotiation."
