"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering a 50-50 split of the $10,000, with each of us getting $5,000. This seems fair at first glance, but I need to remember that inflation affects me but not Alice. If I reject and we move to round 2, the money will be worth 20% less to me, so I would need to get more than $5,000 to match the current value of $5,000.

Given that this is a perfectly equal split in nominal terms, and any delay would decrease the value for me but not for Alice, accepting this offer is the rational choice.
