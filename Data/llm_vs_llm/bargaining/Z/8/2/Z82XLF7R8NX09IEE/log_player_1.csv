"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me propose a fair split, considering I'll lose 20% value in each round if we don't agree now.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose an equal split of the money - $500,000 each. This is a fair and reasonable offer that gives us both significant value, and it allows us to avoid the risk of inflation reducing the money's worth in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

The offer gives me $450,000, but due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $360,000 to me now. If I reject and we continue to the next round, any future gains will be worth even less due to compounding inflation (another 20% less in round 3).

Bob's offer is reasonable given the circumstances, and the risk of getting even less in future rounds due to inflation makes accepting this offer the rational choice.
