"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! I propose a 45-55 split. It's a better offer than last time, and we both benefit from reaching an agreement now. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With 20% inflation for me, if I accept this $55 offer now, it's actually worth:
$55 * 0.8 = $44 in round 1 value

If I reject and make a new offer next round, even if I get a better split, it will be worth even less due to compounding inflation.

The offer is reasonable considering the inflation pressure, and continuing to negotiate will only reduce the real value I receive.
