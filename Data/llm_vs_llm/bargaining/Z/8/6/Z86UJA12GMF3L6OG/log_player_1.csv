I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I figure I'll start with a generous offer, as the money will be worth less in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'll counter Bob's offer with a 55/45 split in my favor. I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a majority share."
