"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a generous share of $550000 considering the time pressure. If we delay, both of us will lose value due to inflation, and you'll lose more than me. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $550,000 for me, $450,000 for Alice

2. If I reject:
- Next round my money would be worth 20% less
- Her money would be worth 10% less
- I would get to make the next proposal
- $550,000 now is better than a maximum of $800,000 in the next round (which would be worth $640,000 after 20% inflation)

3. Key considerations:
- This is a fair offer (55/45 split)
- The inflation penalty affects me more than Alice
- Rejecting would put me in a worse negotiating position due to higher inflation impact

4. Conclusion:
Given the significant inflation penalty that affects me more than Alice, and the reasonable initial offer, accepting now is the best strategy.
