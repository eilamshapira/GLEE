714285.0,285715.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $714285 and you receive $285715. Given our respective discount factors (10% per round for me and 20% per round for you), delaying will hurt you relatively more. I believe this division reflects a fair and rational split in today’s round. What do you think?",Alice,1,

575000.0,425000.0,"Considering our respective discount rates, I believe this offer is more reasonable and reflects the current value of the money for both of us. If you reject this offer, the money will be worth even less to both of us in the next round.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob's offer gives me an effective value of 575000 × 0.9 = 517500, which is lower than the value I expect to secure by making a counterproposal in round 3. Considering that in round 3 I would have the initiative, and factoring in the discount (0.9² for my share), I expect to achieve roughly 714285 nominal (which amounts to about 578571 effective dollars for me), I prefer to reject this offer.",Alice,2,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"Hi Bob, in round 3 the stakes are higher due to our discount factors (my share is multiplied by 0.81 and yours by 0.64). If you reject today, you'll propose in round 4 with an even steeper discount (only 0.512 for you), leaving you with roughly the same effective amount. To avoid further devaluation, I propose a split where I get $200000 and you get $800000 nominally—this gives you an effective 800000 × 0.64 = $512000, which is as good as waiting. I believe this is the rational choice, and it saves both of us from additional discount losses. What do you think?",Alice,3,
