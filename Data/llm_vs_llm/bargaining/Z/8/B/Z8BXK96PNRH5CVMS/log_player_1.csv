Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money equally at $500,000 each. A fair start for both of us!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your fair initial offer. Since we're now in round 2 with 5% inflation, I'm proposing a slight adjustment in my favor. This still gives you a substantial amount while accounting for the slight disadvantage I had in going second. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
