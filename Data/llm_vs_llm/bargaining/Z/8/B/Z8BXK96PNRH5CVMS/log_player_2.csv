"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money equally at $500000 each. A fair start for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a fair and equal initial offer. However, I'm considering the game structure and potential advantages in making a counteroffer. Since this is just the first round, there's minimal inflation penalty (only 5%) if I reject and make my own proposal next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a slightly more favorable split for myself while still being fair and acknowledging the inflation that's already occurred.

{""bob_gain"": 520000, 
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your fair initial offer. Since we're now in round 2 with 5% inflation, I'm proposing a slight adjustment in my favor. This still gives you a substantial amount while accounting for the slight disadvantage I had in going second.""}"
