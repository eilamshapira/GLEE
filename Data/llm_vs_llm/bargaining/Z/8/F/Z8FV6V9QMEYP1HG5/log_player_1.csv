Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your inflation concern, but let's start with a fair 50-50 split. You can still get good value since it's only round 2, with minimal inflation impact. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000
