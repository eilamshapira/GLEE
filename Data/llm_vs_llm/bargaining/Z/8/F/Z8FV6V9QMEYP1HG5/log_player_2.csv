"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40 in my favor to account for the inflation I face. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer:
1. She's offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000
2. She justifies the uneven split due to her 5% inflation penalty per round
3. However, if I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
4. While her inflation concern is valid, a 60-40 split seems too favorable for her
5. Since it's early in the game (round 1), I can afford to negotiate for a better deal

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced counter-offer while acknowledging Alice's inflation concern:

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I understand your inflation concern, but let's start with a fair 50-50 split. You can still get good value since it's only round 2, with minimal inflation impact.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the need for fairness, but I also need to consider the inflation. Let's compromise with a 55-45 split in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:
1. She's reduced her demand from 60-40 to 55-45
2. She's offering me $450,000 now (up from $400,000)
3. The inflation impact on her share is now 9.75%, which is significant
4. She's showing willingness to negotiate and compromise
5. While I could push for more, there's a risk of further rounds reducing her value
6. This split seems more reasonable considering the inflation she faces

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
