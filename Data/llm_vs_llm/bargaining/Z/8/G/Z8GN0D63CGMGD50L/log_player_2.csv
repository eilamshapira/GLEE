"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since I'm starting the game. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000, keeping $600,000 for herself
2. While not a 50-50 split, it's still a substantial amount
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
4. However, there's no guarantee Alice will accept my counter-offer
5. With no inflation affecting my share, the value stays the same across rounds
6. It's a reasonable first offer, though not ideal

While I could try to negotiate for more, this is a decent offer and there's risk in rejection. Taking a guaranteed $400,000 is better than risking it for potentially less if negotiations break down.
