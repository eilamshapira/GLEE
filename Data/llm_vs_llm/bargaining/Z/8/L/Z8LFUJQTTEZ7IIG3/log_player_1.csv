"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 50/50 split which is fair to both of us. Consider that I face 20% inflation per round while you only face 5%, so delays hurt me much more. A 50/50 split now benefits both of us more than prolonged negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates and Bob's message, I think a 50/50 split is reasonable, especially since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, and it will continue to decrease.
