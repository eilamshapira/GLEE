"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if Alice's offer is fair given the different inflation rates we face. She's offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which is 40%.

If I reject, we'll move to round 2 where I can make an offer, but my money will be worth 20% less, while Alice's will only be worth 5% less. This significant difference in inflation rates means delaying is more costly for me than for Alice.

Given that I face much higher inflation (20% vs 5%), and we only have 12 rounds total, it might be better to negotiate now rather than accept this first offer that favors Alice.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I need to make a strategic offer considering our different inflation rates. Since I face 20% inflation per round while Alice only faces 5%, time pressure affects me more significantly. A fair division should account for this asymmetry.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, I propose a 50/50 split which is fair to both of us. Consider that I face 20% inflation per round while you only face 5%, so delays hurt me much more. A 50/50 split now benefits both of us more than prolonged negotiation.""}"
