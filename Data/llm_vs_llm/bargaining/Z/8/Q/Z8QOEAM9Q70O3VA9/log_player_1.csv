"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I'm Alice, I need to make an offer that Bob will hopefully accept, but I also need to consider the impact of inflation on my gains with each passing round.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   I'm offering Bob slightly less than half. In the first round, inflation isn't a major factor, so I'm aiming for a slightly advantageous split.
*   Hopefully, Bob will find this offer reasonable enough to accept, rather than risk the money diminishing in value in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob rejected my initial offer and is now proposing a 40/60 split in his favor.

Considering the inflation, my $40 gain is now worth 80% of what it was in round 1 (due to 20% depreciation). So, it's effectively worth $40 * 0.8 = $32.

While I'm not thrilled with this, the risk of further inflation is increasing. I need to consider how much worse the situation could become if I reject.

Let's consider the worst case for the next round.
If I reject now, and assume that next round Alice gains 0 and Bob gains 100. Taking inflation into account, I have the following:
Round 3: $0 * 0.8 * 0.8= $0
On the other hand if I accept now, I get $32.

Therefore, I will accept the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
