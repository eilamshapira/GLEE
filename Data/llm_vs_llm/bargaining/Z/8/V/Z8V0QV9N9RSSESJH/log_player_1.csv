"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split 55/45. It's a good deal for both of us and avoids further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $45. With the 20% inflation penalty, waiting longer would reduce my gains further, and this is a reasonable split. Better to secure this amount now than risk getting less in future rounds."
