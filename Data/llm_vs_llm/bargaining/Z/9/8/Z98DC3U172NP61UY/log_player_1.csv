"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's have a fair split and share the total equally. This way, we both benefit! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of an equal 50-50 split. This is a fair division that benefits both of us equally, and there's no reason to risk losing everything by continuing to negotiate."
