550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, for our first round I propose that I receive $550000 and you receive $450000. Given that the full value is available now and considering the potential inflation hit on my share in later rounds, I believe this is both fair and efficient. Looking forward to your thoughts.",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can both do better. I'm proposing a more equitable split of 550000 for me and 450000 for you.  Let's start off with a fair deal, and see if we can work together to reach a mutually beneficial outcome.",Bob,2,
