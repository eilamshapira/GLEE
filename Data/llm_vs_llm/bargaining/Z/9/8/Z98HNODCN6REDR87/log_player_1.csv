"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, for our first round I propose that I receive $550,000 and you receive $450,000. Given that the full value is available now and considering the potential inflation hit on my share in later rounds, I believe this is both fair and efficient. Looking forward to your thoughts.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can both do better. I'm proposing a more equitable split of 550000 for me and 450000 for you.  Let's start off with a fair deal, and see if we can work together to reach a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
