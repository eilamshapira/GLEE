"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, for our first round I propose that I receive $550000 and you receive $450000. Given that the full value is available now and considering the potential inflation hit on my share in later rounds, I believe this is both fair and efficient. Looking forward to your thoughts. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
