6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor since I'm affected by 20% inflation each round. This way we both benefit and can finish the game quickly.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Since the money is worth 20% less for you each round, I think it's fair that I get a larger share. Let's settle this quickly before the value drops further for you.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, due to the 20% inflation penalty I face each round, I need a larger share to achieve fair value. My 7000 is now worth only 5600 to me due to two rounds of inflation. If you reject this, we'll both lose more value in future rounds. Let's make a deal now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"Alice, considering the inflation penalty you're facing, I'm surprised you didn't accept my previous offer. Now, with the value dropping further for you, I'm willing to give you a smaller share. Let's settle before it's too late.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
8000.0,2000.0,"Bob, let's be rational. Due to inflation, my 8000 is now worth only about 4100 to me, while your 2000 is still worth 2000. If we keep going, we both risk getting nothing after 12 rounds. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
1500.0,8500.0,"Alice, I understand the inflation is hitting you hard, but I'm not willing to give up that much value. With the money being worth significantly less to you, I think this offer is more than generous. Let's end this before you lose even more.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
9000.0,1000.0,"Bob, we're reaching a critical point. With 67% inflation so far, even this 9000 is only worth about 2950 to me, while your 1000 remains at full value. If you reject this, we'll both be worse off. Let's end this now with a deal that gives us both something meaningful.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
1000.0,9000.0,"Alice, I know the inflation is severely impacting your side, but I'm not willing to compromise further. With the value of your share dropping drastically, I think it's time for you to consider the reality of the situation. This offer is final - take it or risk losing everything.",Bob,8,
