"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  It's a good starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you have any thoughts. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice's proposal gives her a bit more (55$) than me (45$), but it's not extremely unfair. If I reject, we move to the next round where I propose, but the total money decreases by 5% to 95$. 

If I'm thinking strategically, I could counter with a more favorable split in the next round. However, the money is depreciating with each round, and there's no guarantee Alice will accept my counter-offer.

Given that it's a reasonable first offer and the risk of losing value through continued negotiation, I'll respond:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
