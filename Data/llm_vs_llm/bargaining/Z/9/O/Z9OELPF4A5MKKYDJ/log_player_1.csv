"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the higher inflation impact on my side, with a clear message to Bob.

{
    ""alice_gain"": 5500,
    ""bob_gain"": 4500,
    ""message"": ""I suggest a slightly higher share for me since inflation affects me more severely (10% vs your 5%). This is fair and prevents prolonged negotiations that would hurt us both.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation effect, I'm offering a more balanced split. Let's agree to avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $4800, but with 10% inflation, it's worth $4320
- If I reject and we go to next round:
  - Money will depreciate further (another 10% for me, 5% for Bob)
  - My next offer would be worth even less to both of us
  - Bob would likely reject again, leading to more value loss

While Bob's offer gives them slightly more, the inflation factor makes accepting now better than continuing negotiations.
