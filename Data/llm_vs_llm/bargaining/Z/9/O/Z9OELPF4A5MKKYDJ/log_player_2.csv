"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a slightly higher share for me since inflation affects me more severely (10% vs your 5%). This is fair and prevents prolonged negotiations that would hurt us both. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice after each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

The initial amount is $10,000. After one round, the value for me is $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500, and for Alice, it's $10,000 * 0.90 = $9,000.

Considering this, I'll make a proposal that takes into account the decreasing value and tries to find a mutually beneficial split.
