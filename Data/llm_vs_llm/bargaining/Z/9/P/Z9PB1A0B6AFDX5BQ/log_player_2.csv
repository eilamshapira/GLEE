"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair and we both get a good share before inflation affects us too much. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's a fair offer, and there's no guarantee that future offers will be better, especially with the risk of getting nothing if the game goes on for too many rounds. Additionally, since inflation doesn't affect me, accepting this offer ensures a substantial gain."
