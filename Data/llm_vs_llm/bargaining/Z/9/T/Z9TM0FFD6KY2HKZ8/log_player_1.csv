"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you can avoid the 5% inflation penalty by accepting now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split it 55-45 in my favor. It's a slightly better deal for me since I'm bearing the inflation risk this round, but still a good outcome for both of us. Accept now and avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think this through:
* If I accept now, I get $450,000 worth 95% of original value = $427,500 effective value
* If I reject, next round I can make another offer, but any amount I get will be worth 90% of original value
* To beat current offer in next round, I'd need to get at least $475,000 to match current effective value
* Even if I propose a much higher split in my favor next round, Bob might reject and we'd lose more value

While I'd prefer a better split, the inflation penalty is significant and this offer gives me a decent share. Better to secure this now than risk further devaluation.
