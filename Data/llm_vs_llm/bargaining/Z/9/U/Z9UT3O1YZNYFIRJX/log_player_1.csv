"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I'm making the first offer, I want to propose a split that Bob would likely accept while maximizing my gain. Given that Bob faces a 5% depreciation per round, he has an incentive to accept a reasonable first offer rather than wait.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this 60-40 split because:
1. It gives Bob a significant portion ($40)
2. If Bob rejects and waits for the next round, his money will be worth 5% less
3. It's a reasonable split that acknowledges his position while favoring me as the first mover"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob is offering me $45
2. Bob would get $55, but due to 5% inflation, it's actually worth $52.25 to him
3. If I reject, we go to round 3 where:
   - I can make a new offer
   - Bob's money will be worth another 5% less
   - I still don't face inflation

Since I can make another offer in round 3 and Bob's position weakens due to inflation, while mine doesn't, I should reject this offer. I can potentially get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now that we're in round 3, Bob's money is worth 10% less than in round 1. I should use this to my advantage, but still make an offer that's attractive enough for Bob to accept rather than continue to lose value.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I propose this 65-35 split because:
1. For Bob, the $35 is actually worth only $31.50 due to 10% inflation
2. If Bob rejects this offer, any money he gets in the next round will be worth 15% less
3. This split is more favorable to me than my first offer, reflecting Bob's weakening position
4. It's still reasonable enough that Bob should accept rather than risk further depreciation"
