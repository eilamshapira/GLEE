55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split considering our different inflation rates. You lose value faster at 10% per round compared to my 5%, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This split gives us both substantial value without needing to go to another round where we both lose.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Hi Alice, I rejected your offer because I believe a 50-50 split is fairer, especially considering my higher inflation rate. Let's agree on this to avoid further loss in value for both of us.",Bob,2,

52.0,48.0,"Bob, I appreciate your offer of an even split, but I've adjusted slightly in my favor since we're both losing value with each round. With inflation rates of 5% for me and 10% for you, it's especially important for you to reach an agreement now. This is a very reasonable compromise that gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging that I have a slightly stronger position due to my lower inflation rate.",Alice,3,
