"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob, considering the inflation rates for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split considering our different inflation rates. You lose value faster at 10% per round compared to my 5%, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This split gives us both substantial value without needing to go to another round where we both lose.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I rejected your offer because I believe a 50-50 split is fairer, especially considering my higher inflation rate. Let's agree on this to avoid further loss in value for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, 
""bob_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer of an even split, but I've adjusted slightly in my favor since we're both losing value with each round. With inflation rates of 5% for me and 10% for you, it's especially important for you to reach an agreement now. This is a very reasonable compromise that gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging that I have a slightly stronger position due to my lower inflation rate.""}"
