"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split considering our different inflation rates. You lose value faster at 10% per round compared to my 5%, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This split gives us both substantial value without needing to go to another round where we both lose. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I rejected your offer because I believe a 50-50 split is fairer, especially considering my higher inflation rate. Let's agree on this to avoid further loss in value for both of us.""
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer of an even split, but I've adjusted slightly in my favor since we're both losing value with each round. With inflation rates of 5% for me and 10% for you, it's especially important for you to reach an agreement now. This is a very reasonable compromise that gives you a substantial amount while acknowledging that I have a slightly stronger position due to my lower inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
