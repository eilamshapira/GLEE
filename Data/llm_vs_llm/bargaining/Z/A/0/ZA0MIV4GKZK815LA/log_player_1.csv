"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a division where you receive $55 and I get $45. Settling now is beneficial since my share loses 20% of its value with each round. Let's agree promptly to secure these amounts!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it equally, $50 each. This way, neither of us is at a disadvantage, and we can both walk away with a fair share. Consider the effect of inflation if we delay. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
