"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a division where you receive $55 and I get $45. Settling now is beneficial since my share loses 20% of its value with each round. Let's agree promptly to secure these amounts! 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
