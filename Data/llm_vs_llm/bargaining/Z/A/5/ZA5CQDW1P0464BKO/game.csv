550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a deal: I'll receive $550000 and you'll receive $450000. By agreeing now, we both avoid any complications or potential losses due to inflation in later rounds. I believe this is a fair arrangement to secure our winnings quickly. Looking forward to your positive response.",Alice,1,

480000.0,520000.0,"Let's split it fairly, considering the inflation risk. My proposal: I get $520000, and you get $480000. It's a good deal for both, and we should act quickly to avoid further devaluation.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'll pass on this round. Given the inflation hit on your share and the fact that I get full value without any deductions, I believe we have room to negotiate a deal that works better for both of us in the next round. Let's keep looking for a mutually beneficial arrangement.",Alice,2,reject
451000.0,549000.0,"Hi Bob, considering that each round further erodes the value of your share (now down by 10% compared to Round 1), I’d like to propose a deal that helps you stave off further losses. In this offer, I receive $451000 and you receive $549000, which means your effective value is about $549000 × 0.90 ≈ $494100—roughly matching the real value of your previous offer in Round 2. Accepting now secures our winnings before inflation worsens our positions further. I hope you find this proposal fair and in our mutual best interest.",Alice,3,
