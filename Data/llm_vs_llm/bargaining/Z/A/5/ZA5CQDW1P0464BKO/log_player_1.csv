"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a deal: I'll receive $550,000 and you'll receive $450,000. By agreeing now, we both avoid any complications or potential losses due to inflation in later rounds. I believe this is a fair arrangement to secure our winnings quickly. Looking forward to your positive response.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, considering the inflation risk. My proposal: I get $520000, and you get $480000. It's a good deal for both, and we should act quickly to avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'll pass on this round. Given the inflation hit on your share and the fact that I get full value without any deductions, I believe we have room to negotiate a deal that works better for both of us in the next round. Let's keep looking for a mutually beneficial arrangement.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 451000, ""bob_gain"": 549000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, considering that each round further erodes the value of your share (now down by 10% compared to Round 1), I’d like to propose a deal that helps you stave off further losses. In this offer, I receive $451,000 and you receive $549,000, which means your effective value is about $549,000 × 0.90 ≈ $494,100—roughly matching the real value of your previous offer in Round 2. Accepting now secures our winnings before inflation worsens our positions further. I hope you find this proposal fair and in our mutual best interest.""}"
