Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a deal: I'll receive $550000 and you'll receive $450000. By agreeing now, we both avoid any complications or potential losses due to inflation in later rounds. I believe this is a fair arrangement to secure our winnings quickly. Looking forward to your positive response.

# Alice gain: 550000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I'll make a reasonable offer to Alice. Considering the inflation effect, I'll propose a division that is slightly in my favor to account for the potential loss in value.

""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the inflation risk. My proposal: I get $520,000, and you get $480,000. It's a good deal for both, and we should act quickly to avoid further devaluation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, considering that each round further erodes the value of your share (now down by 10% compared to Round 1), I’d like to propose a deal that helps you stave off further losses. In this offer, I receive $451000 and you receive $549000, which means your effective value is about $549000 × 0.90 ≈ $494100—roughly matching the real value of your previous offer in Round 2. Accepting now secures our winnings before inflation worsens our positions further. I hope you find this proposal fair and in our mutual best interest. 
# Bob gain: 549000 
# Alice gain: 451000
