"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. The offer is a 50-50 split, which is traditionally considered fair
2. If I reject, I'll make the next offer, but:
   - The money will be worth 20% less to me
   - 100$ will become effectively worth 80$ to me
   - Even if I propose a more favorable split next round, I'll be working with less value

A 50$ gain now is better than potentially getting even 60$ of the inflated money next round (which would only be worth 48$ to me due to inflation).

Therefore, I'll accept this fair offer.
