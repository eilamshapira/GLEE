"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning is that I'm starting with a slightly advantageous position, considering I'm making the first offer. I'm also mindful of the inflation risk and want to secure a reasonable portion early on. This offer gives Bob a significant amount while still prioritizing my potential gains given the time constraint."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","Absolutely not. That's an absurd offer.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn again. I need to consider the inflation that has happened for both of us. I'll try to make a more appealing offer, but also protect myself from further losses due to time. Remember that the money I gain is worth 20% less than in round 1 (10% + 10% from round 2), and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in round 1 (5%+5% from round 2).

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```
This offer gives Bob a larger share than my initial offer in Round 1, hopefully enticing him to accept. I am still taking a larger share, but I am lowering the amount I am asking."
