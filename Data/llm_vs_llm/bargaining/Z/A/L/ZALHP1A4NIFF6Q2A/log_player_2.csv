"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the advantage of making the first move. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $400,000 while she takes $600,000.

If I reject and move to the next round, I would make a counter-offer, but the money would be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. That means the total value to me would be $900,000 in the next round.

If I make a counter-offer in round 2, I could propose a more favorable split, but Alice might reject it, leading to further inflation in round 3.

Given that I'm already being offered 40% of the money, and inflation will reduce the value in subsequent rounds, I'll accept this offer.
