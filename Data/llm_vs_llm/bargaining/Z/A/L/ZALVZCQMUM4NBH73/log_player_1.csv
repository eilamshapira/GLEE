"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make the first offer, considering that with each round the money is worth 20% less to me. I want to propose a fair split that Bob would be likely to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering you a bit more than half because I'm making the first move, and I value reaching an agreement quickly due to the inflation penalty. This is a reasonable split that gives both of us a substantial portion of the money."
