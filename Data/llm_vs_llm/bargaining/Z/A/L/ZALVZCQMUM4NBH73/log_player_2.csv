"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $450,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less next round when I make a counter-offer
3. $450,000 now is better than $475,000 next round due to the 5% inflation
4. This is a reasonable first offer, close to 50-50
5. Starting a negotiation war might lead to significant value loss due to inflation
