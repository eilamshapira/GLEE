"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60%, you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the impact of inflation on this offer. If I reject, the total value of $10,000 will be worth 10% less to me in the next round, meaning the total pot would effectively be worth $9,000 to me. 

While Alice's offer gives me $4,000, which is less than half, I need to weigh this against making a counter-offer in the next round where the total value to me has decreased.
