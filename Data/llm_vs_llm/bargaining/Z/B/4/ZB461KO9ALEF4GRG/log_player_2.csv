"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer.

*   **Alice's offer:** Bob gets $40, Alice gets $60.
*   **My current value of money:** It's round 1, so the value is still 100% (no inflation yet).
*   **My inflation:** It will start on the next round (round 2), making money worth 10% less.

If I reject, I will make a proposal on Round 2.
If Alice reject my offer in Round 2, money will be worth 10% less for me AND 20% less for Alice.

Given this information and the potential for the value of the money to decay rapidly for both of us, I will accept the offer.
