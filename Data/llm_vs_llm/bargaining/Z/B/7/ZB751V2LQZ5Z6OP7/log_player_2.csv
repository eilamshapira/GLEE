"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000. While this isn't an even split, it's still a substantial amount. However, since this is just the first round and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer, I believe I can negotiate for a fairer division.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still leaving some advantage to incentivize acceptance.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I propose this split because it's closer to an equal division while still being reasonable. It gives both of us a substantial amount and shows I'm willing to be fair but also firm in negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has moved from her initial offer of 4000/6000 to 4500/5500, showing she's willing to negotiate. However, this is exactly the reverse of what I just proposed. Since we still have 9 rounds left, I think there's room to reach a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose an even split now. This is the most fair division possible, and it shows I'm willing to be completely equitable. There's no rational reason to reject a 50-50 split.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}"
