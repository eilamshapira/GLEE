"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $400,000, keeping $600,000 for herself
2. If I reject, we move to round 2, where I can make a counter-offer
3. However, due to 20% inflation per round for me, my money will be worth 20% less in the next round
4. $400,000 now is better than a larger number that's worth less due to inflation
5. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of losing value through inflation is significant

The offer is reasonable enough considering the inflation penalty I face. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
