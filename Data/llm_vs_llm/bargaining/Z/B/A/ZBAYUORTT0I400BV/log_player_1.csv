"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both want to conclude this quickly to avoid inflation eating into our gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable, considering we both want to avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept now, I get $4500, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $4050
2. If I reject, I can make another offer in round 3, but:
   - The money will be worth 20% less for me
   - Bob might reject again, leading to even more inflation loss
   - Bob's position seems strong since inflation doesn't affect him

Given these factors, while the split isn't ideal, waiting longer will likely result in an even worse outcome for me due to the asymmetric inflation effect.
