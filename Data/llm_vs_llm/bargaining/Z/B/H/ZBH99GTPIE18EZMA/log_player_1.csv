Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split would be fair. I'm proposing I get $55 and you get $45. This is actually closer to 50/50 than your initial offer, and we should finalize now before inflation reduces the total value further for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
