"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I'll take 60, you get 40. Sounds good? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate this offer.

Alice is proposing a 60/40 split in her favor. If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-proposal in round 2, but the total money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation, meaning we'd effectively be splitting 90$ from my perspective.

This isn't an equal split, and I can likely do better by making a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since I'm making the counter-proposal now, I'll aim for a fair split while acknowledging the inflation impact.

{""bob_gain"": 55, 
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I think a more balanced split would be fair. I'm proposing I get $55 and you get $45. This is actually closer to 50/50 than your initial offer, and we should finalize now before inflation reduces the total value further for both of us.""}"
