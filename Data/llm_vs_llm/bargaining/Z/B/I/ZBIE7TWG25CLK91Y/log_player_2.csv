"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose an even split â€” $50 for me and $50 for you. This round is our best chance to lock in value before inflation bites my side. Let's agree now and both avoid any future discounting. Looking forward to your acceptance! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, I need to consider the inflation effect - with each round, the money is worth 10% less to me.

If I reject now and propose in round 2, the total value to me would be discounted by 10%. That means even if I proposed to take all $100 in round 2, it would only be worth $90 to me.

A guaranteed $50 now is better than risking a negotiation process where the value keeps decreasing for me. Since this is the first round with no inflation yet, and a 50-50 split is generally considered fair, I'll accept.
