"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, considering the decreasing value of the money for me.

Here's my first offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slightly favorable offer for myself to see how Bob reacts. I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid the inflation penalty."
