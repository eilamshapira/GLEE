"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if Alice's offer is fair given the inflation effect.

The offer gives me $4,000 out of $10,000, which is 40% of the total. If I reject, we move to the next round where I can make an offer, but the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation.

If I reject, the $10,000 would be worth $9,000 to me in the next round. I could try to negotiate for more, but there's risk involved, and the value keeps decreasing with each round.

Since I still get a substantial amount ($4,000) and avoid the 10% inflation penalty, I'll accept this offer.
