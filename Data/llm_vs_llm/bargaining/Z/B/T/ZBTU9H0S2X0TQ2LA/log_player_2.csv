"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair deal considering it's my first offer. Let's avoid the money losing value with further rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%)
2. If I reject, the next round's money will be worth 10% less to me
3. In the next round, I could propose a split, but:
   - The $10,000 would only be worth $9,000 to me
   - Even if I proposed a 60/40 split in my favor, I'd get $5,400, but it would only be worth $4,860 to me
4. The current offer of $4,000 is better than what I could reasonably expect to get in the next round after inflation
