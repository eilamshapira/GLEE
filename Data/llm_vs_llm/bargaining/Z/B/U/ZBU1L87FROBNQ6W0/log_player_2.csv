"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- Alice is offering me $40 out of $100
- If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be worth 5% less to me
- 95% of $100 = $95, so next round we're effectively dividing $95 from my perspective
- A 50-50 split next round would give me $47.50, but Alice would need to accept it
- There's risk in rejection as we could go multiple rounds, losing more value

While $40 isn't a perfectly fair split, it's a reasonable first offer. Given the inflation penalty and the risk of a prolonged negotiation reducing the pie further, I'll accept.
