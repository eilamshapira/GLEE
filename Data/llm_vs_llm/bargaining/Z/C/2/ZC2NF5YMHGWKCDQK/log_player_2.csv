"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully, taking into account the inflation rates.

Alice is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for herself. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in round 2, but the money will be worth 10% less to me and 5% less to Alice.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, I'd need to offer Alice enough that she wouldn't want to wait for round 3. Given the inflation rates, this might not be significantly better for me than the current offer.

The 40/60 split isn't equal, but considering the inflation penalties affect me more severely than Alice, accepting now might be better than risking further devaluation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for our different inflation rates. Since I'm more affected by inflation (10% per round vs Alice's 5%), I should aim for a fair division that incentivizes Alice to accept now rather than delay.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the money. This is fair and equitable, giving us each half a million dollars. Since you face a lower inflation rate than I do, delaying would hurt me more than you, but neither of us benefits from unnecessary delays."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this new offer carefully.

Alice has slightly improved her offer from $400,000 to $420,000 for me, while reducing her portion from $600,000 to $580,000.

Due to inflation, the money is now worth 19% less to me and 9.75% less to Alice. If I reject and we continue to round 4, the inflation will increase further, reducing the value even more.

Let me calculate the actual value of this offer to me: $420,000 Ã— (1 - 0.19) = $340,200

If I reject and we keep going back and forth, the inflation will continue to reduce the value for both of us, with me being more affected due to my higher inflation rate (10% per round vs Alice's 5%).

Given that Alice only improved her offer slightly and considering the asymmetric inflation rates that disadvantage me more, I should take this offer before the money loses more value.
