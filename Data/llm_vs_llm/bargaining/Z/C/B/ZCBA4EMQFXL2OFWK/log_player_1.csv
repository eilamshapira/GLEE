Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it might seem tempting to take a little less than half now, I believe I can still negotiate for a better outcome.  The longer the game goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 

Even split. It's fair and avoids further losses due to inflation."
