"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%)
2. If I reject, we move to next round where:
   - The money is worth 10% less to me
   - The money is worth 20% less to Alice
   - I get to make the next proposal

The current split seems unfavorable to me, as Alice is taking a larger share (60%). Given that money devalues more quickly for Alice (20% vs my 10%), I have leverage to negotiate a better deal. By rejecting this offer, I can propose a more favorable split in the next round when Alice's position is weaker.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

Since Alice's money devalues faster (20% vs my 10% per round), and we just lost one round, I should propose a more balanced split while highlighting our mutual interest in reaching an agreement soon.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""A fair 50-50 split is better for both of us. Remember, delays hurt you more than me due to higher depreciation on your side.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle, slightly in my favor 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer is $4,200 for me (42%) and $5,800 for Alice (58%)
2. Due to inflation:
   - My $4,200 is actually worth $3,402 (19% less)
   - Alice's $5,800 is worth $3,712 (36% less)
3. If I reject:
   - Next round money will be worth 28% less for me
   - Next round money will be worth 48% less for Alice
   - I get to make the next proposal

Alice has moved slightly in my direction (from 40% to 42%), but given that her money is devaluing much faster than mine, I still have negotiating leverage. The difference in our inflation rates (20% vs 10%) means each round hurts her more than me. I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and proposing a more favorable split next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that we're now in round 4 and Alice's money is devaluing faster, I'll propose a split that's more in my favor while still being reasonable enough for her to accept:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Time is strongly against us both, but especially you with 20% depreciation per round. This 55-45 split is fair considering our different depreciation rates, and we should agree now before further losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly better for you, but still considering my higher losses 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Current offer: $4,400 (44%) for me, $5,600 (56%) for Alice
2. After inflation:
   - My $4,400 is worth $2,887 (34.39% less)
   - Alice's $5,600 is worth $2,294 (59.04% less)
3. If I reject:
   - Next round money will be worth 41% less for me
   - Next round money will be worth 67% less for Alice

While Alice has improved her offer again (from 42% to 44% for me), we're now getting into dangerous territory with significant value loss. We're almost halfway through our rounds, and the actual value we're both getting is dramatically decreasing. Alice's position is particularly weak with her 59% depreciation.

However, given that Alice has shown a pattern of gradual concessions and the severe depreciation we're both facing, it's reasonable to accept this offer now before we lose more value.
