"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering you a fair $400000 right now. Remember, if you wait, each round will make your share worth 20% less to you. Let's make a deal now and both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of $1,000,000 (40%)
2. If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me
3. Even if I propose a better split next round, my $400,000 now would be worth more than $500,000 in the next round due to the 20% inflation
4. This is actually a decent first offer considering the inflation penalty I face

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me. $400,000 now is better than a potentially larger sum that's worth less due to inflation.
