Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, let's consider the inflation. My gain is now worth 40% less than in round 1 (20% * 2 rounds), and Bob's gain is worth 10% less (5% * 2 rounds). To account for this, and to make it more appealing, I'll offer him a slightly better deal than I would have initially.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, the inflation is really eating into my potential gains now. My money is worth almost half of what it was initially. I need to make this a compelling offer for Bob, but still try to get a reasonable amount considering the devaluation.
