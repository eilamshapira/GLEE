"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer.

Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which is objectively fair. However, since I'm making the next offer if I reject, and there's still plenty of rounds left, I could potentially get a better deal. 

The 20% inflation penalty per round means:
- Current value: $10,000
- Next round value: $8,000

If I reject, I could propose a 60-40 split next round ($4,800 for me, $3,200 for Alice), but Alice might reject that, leading to further value loss.

The current offer of $5,000 is actually quite reasonable, and trying to get more might result in both of us getting less due to inflation.
