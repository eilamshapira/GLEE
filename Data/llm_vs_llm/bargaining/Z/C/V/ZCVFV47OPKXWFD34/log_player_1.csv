"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer that takes into account the 5% inflation penalty I face each round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose this division because it's fair and slightly in my favor, which makes sense since I face a 5% inflation penalty each round. This gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my need to secure a good deal early."
