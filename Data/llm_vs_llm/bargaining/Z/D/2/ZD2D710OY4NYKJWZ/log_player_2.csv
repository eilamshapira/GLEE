"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I get $40 while she gets $60 out of our $100. While this isn't an even split, it's not terribly unfair either. I could reject and make a counter-offer, but there's also the risk of extended negotiations where we might both end up with nothing if we can't agree within 12 rounds.

Since there's no inflation affecting me (0% less each round), I don't lose value by continuing negotiation. However, I don't know how inflation affects Alice, which might give me leverage in later rounds if inflation impacts her negatively.

For now, I'll reject this offer and propose a more equitable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more balanced split while still being reasonable.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money evenly - $50 for me and $50 for you. This is a fair division that benefits us both equally."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Alice has improved her offer to me slightly (from $40 to $45), and I now have information that inflation is affecting Alice significantly - her money is worth 36% less than in the first round. This gives me some negotiating leverage.

Since I'm not affected by inflation (my money maintains its value), I could potentially benefit from extending negotiations further. Alice may be more willing to offer me a better deal in future rounds as inflation continues to reduce the value of her share.

However, I also need to consider the risk of not reaching an agreement within the 12-round limit. Alice has moved toward a more equitable split, but it's still not completely fair.

After consideration, I'll reject this offer and propose a better split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Alice is facing significant inflation (36% less value already by round 3), while I'm not affected by inflation, I'll propose a slightly more favorable offer for myself but still reasonable enough that Alice might accept rather than face further devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I propose I receive $55 and you receive $45. Since inflation is significantly reducing the value of your share with each passing round while my value remains stable, this offer allows us to reach a fair agreement before your potential gains decrease further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has now offered an even 50-50 split, which is fair in nominal terms. However, the inflation situation has changed significantly - Alice's money is now worth 59.04% less than in the first round, while mine maintains its full value.

This means that while Alice would get $50 nominally, the actual value to her is much lower due to inflation. Given this severe inflation impact on Alice's side, and the fact that we're only in round 5 of 12 possible rounds, I suspect Alice may be willing to offer me an even better deal in future rounds.

However, there's also risk in continued negotiation. We need to reach agreement within 12 rounds, and Alice has moved to what appears to be a fair offer on the surface.

After weighing these factors, I'll accept this offer. While I might potentially get more by waiting, a 50-50 split is objectively fair, and the risk of no agreement grows with more rounds.
