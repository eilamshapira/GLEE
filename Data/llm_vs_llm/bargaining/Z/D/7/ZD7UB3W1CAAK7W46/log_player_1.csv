"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to propose a split of $100, knowing that the value of the money decreases by 20% for me with each round. I want to be reasonable but also take the inflation into account.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning is this: It's round 1, so I'm starting with a slight advantage for myself to account for the future inflation. This should still be appealing to Bob since he gets a substantial amount, and rejecting it means risking everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **Bob's Offer:** He's proposing a 50/50 split.

*   **My Situation:** The money is worth 20% less to me than in round 1.

*   **Bob's Situation:** The money is worth 10% less to him than in round 1.

I need to consider if 50% of the current value is better than risking another round, where the inflation will hit me even harder. Also, I need to consider what would be my lowest acceptable value and compare it with current offer

Let's say, originally the value of 1$ is 1 for me. Now it is 0.8 for me. If I reject, and we enter round 3, the value of 1$ will be 0.64.
So, now 50$ is worth 50*0.8 = 40$ for me. It is still quite a bit!

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
