"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Based on a backward‐induction analysis of the 12–round bargaining game—with the twist that while your dollars remain undiminished through time, Bob’s “real” dollars shrink by 20% each round—we can derive an equilibrium outcome.

Here’s a rough sketch of the reasoning (worked “backwards” from the last round):

1. In Round 12 Bob is the proposer. Knowing that if Alice rejects she gets nothing, Bob can “claim” the whole (nominal) $100. (For Bob this “$100” is later discounted by 20% each round that passed; in Round 12 it is worth only (0.8)^(11) of Round-1 dollars, but that does not affect his proposal there.)

2. In Round 11 Alice proposes. To get Bob to accept, she must offer him at least as much (in Round-11 nominal terms) as he would get by waiting until Round 12. (Working through the math, it turns out that in Round 11 Alice’s “optimal” proposal is to offer Bob $80 and keep $20 for herself.)

3. In Round 10 Bob becomes proposer. Now, Alice’s “continuation value” (if she rejects in Round 10, she’ll propose in Round 11 and get $20 nominal) forces Bob to offer her exactly $20. So in Round 10 Bob’s proposal is $20 for Alice and $80 for himself.

4. Repeating this logic for each pair of rounds (notice that because the players alternate, the “bargaining surplus” flips each round) one finds that when it comes time for Round 1—where you (Alice) get to propose—you must offer Bob just enough in nominal dollars (without discount) so that his effective (discount‐adjusted) gain equals what he would get if he waited until his turn in Round 2.

A careful calculation (using that Bob’s money is multiplied by 0.8^(round–1) in each round, while yours is not discounted) shows that the equilibrium offer in Round 1 is to allocate approximately:
 • Alice: $73.79
 • Bob: $26.21

That is, if you propose: {""alice_gain"": 73.79, ""bob_gain"": 26.21}, Bob’s effective payoff from accepting is exactly as good as his “continuation value” (which would be lower because of his 20% per–round loss).
