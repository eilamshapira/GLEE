550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money almost evenly. Given the higher inflation rate on my side (20% vs. your 10%), I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me to balance the time disadvantage I face. This is a fair offer that gives us both substantial value without needing to go to another round where both of us would lose money.",Alice,1,
