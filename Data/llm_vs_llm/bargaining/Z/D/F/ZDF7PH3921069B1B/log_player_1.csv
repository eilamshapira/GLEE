"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money almost evenly. Given the higher inflation rate on my side (20% vs. your 10%), I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me to balance the time disadvantage I face. This is a fair offer that gives us both substantial value without needing to go to another round where both of us would lose money.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation rates, I'm offering a more balanced split. This way, we both get a significant share without losing too much value. Let's end the game here and avoid further depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
