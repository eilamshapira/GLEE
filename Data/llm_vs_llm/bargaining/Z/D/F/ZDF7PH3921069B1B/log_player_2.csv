"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money almost evenly. Given the higher inflation rate on my side (20% vs. your 10%), I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me to balance the time disadvantage I face. This is a fair offer that gives us both substantial value without needing to go to another round where both of us would lose money. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice after each round, I'll take that into consideration for my offer.

{""bob_gain"": 520000, 
""alice_gain"": 480000, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation rates, I'm offering a more balanced split. This way, we both get a significant share without losing too much value. Let's end the game here and avoid further depreciation.""}"
