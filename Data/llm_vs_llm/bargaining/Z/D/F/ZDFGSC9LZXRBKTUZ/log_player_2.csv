"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze Alice's offer:

Alice is proposing a split where I (Bob) get $600,000 and she gets $400,000. 

This is a favorable split for me, giving me 60% of the total amount. Since there's no inflation penalty for me (the money is worth 0% less each round), there's no financial incentive to reject and wait for the next round.

Given that:
1. I receive a majority of the money (60%)
2. There's no inflation penalty for me
3. Accepting now guarantees this favorable outcome
