"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 23.57, ""bob_gain"": 76.43, ""message"": ""Hi Bob – in Round 1 I propose we split the $100 as $23.57 for me and $76.43 for you. I’ve worked out the numbers by thinking ahead: if you reject and get to propose in Round 2, the total will have dropped (by that pesky 5% inflation), and you’d end up with roughly this same value anyway. So accepting this offer now gets you the same benefit but without delay. I hope you agree that this forward‐looking split is in both our best interests!""}"
