"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob – in Round 1 I propose we split the $100 as $23.57 for me and $76.43 for you. I’ve worked out the numbers by thinking ahead: if you reject and get to propose in Round 2, the total will have dropped (by that pesky 5% inflation), and you’d end up with roughly this same value anyway. So accepting this offer now gets you the same benefit but without delay. I hope you agree that this forward‐looking split is in both our best interests! 
# Bob gain: 76.43 
# Alice gain: 23.57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
