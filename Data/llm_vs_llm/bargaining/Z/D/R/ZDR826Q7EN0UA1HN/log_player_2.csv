"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly. How about I take 60%, and you take 40%? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""My turn, let's make it 55/45, a bit more in my favor""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly. How about a 50/50 division? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 36% less, the actual value of my gain would be 5000 * (1 - 0.36) = 5000 * 0.64 = 3200.

Considering this, I think a 50/50 division is not a bad deal, especially since the value of the money will continue to decrease for me in subsequent rounds.
