"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

If I reject now, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the total amount will be worth 10% less to me. So $100 becomes effectively $90 for me.

With the current offer:
- I get $40 now
- If I wait, even if I propose a more favorable split next round, the money will be worth less to me

While a 40-60 split isn't completely fair, it's not terrible. If I reject, I risk:
1. Getting a worse deal later
2. Losing value due to inflation
3. Having my counter-offer rejected, leading to further rounds and more inflation
