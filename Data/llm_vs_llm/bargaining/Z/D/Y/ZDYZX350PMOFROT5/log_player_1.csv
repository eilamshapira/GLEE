"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the rapidly decreasing value of the money for me. Here's my initial offer:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

Rationale: I'm starting with a proposal that favors me, but isn't completely unreasonable. I need to factor in the inflation that will hit me hard if we go to later rounds. I hope Bob accepts this to avoid the loss of value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer.

*   **Bob's offer:** $5000 for me, $5000 for him.
*   **Inflation:** My money is worth 20% less than Round 1. Bob's money is worth 5% less than Round 1.

If I accept, I get $5000, but it's only worth $5000 * 0.8 = $4000 in Round 1 dollars.

If I reject, I get to make an offer next round, but the money will be worth even less to me (another 20% decrease). I have to weigh the potential gain of a better offer against the certainty of further inflation.

Given that the total number of rounds is limited, and inflation is hurting me more than Bob, I'll accept this offer. It's better to get something than risk losing more value.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
