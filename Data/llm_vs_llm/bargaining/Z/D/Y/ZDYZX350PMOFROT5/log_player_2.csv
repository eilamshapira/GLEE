"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing a 40/60 split in her favor. While this isn't an even split, I need to be mindful of the 5% inflation per round. If I reject now, the total pot's value to me decreases, and I'll need to make a counteroffer.

Let me analyze: If I reject and propose a better split next round, the total value to me will be 9,500 (5% less). Even if I could get a 50/50 split then, I'd receive 4,750, which is better than the 4,000 offered now. But Alice might reject that, leading to further inflation.

Given we're only in round 1 of a possible 12, I think I can try for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a fair counteroffer while considering the inflation effect. Since Alice offered a 40/60 split, I'll propose something more balanced but still attractive enough for her to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an even 50/50 split of the money. This is fair to both of us and avoids further rounds of inflation which would reduce the value for everyone. This represents a balanced approach that respects both our interests."
