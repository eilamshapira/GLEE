"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $350,000 out of the $1,000,000 total, which is 35% of the pot.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but I need to account for inflation. For me, the money will be worth 20% less next round, so the $1,000,000 pot would effectively be worth $800,000 to me. For Alice, it would be worth $900,000 due to her 10% inflation rate.

If I accept now, I get $350,000. If I reject and we move to the next round, I'd need to propose something that gives Alice enough value that she'd accept rather than moving to a third round.

Since the inflation rates are asymmetric, there's a strategic disadvantage to prolonging negotiations. I believe I should reject this initial offer and make a counter-proposal that better reflects the inflation dynamics.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer that accounts for the inflation dynamics while being fair enough that Alice would likely accept it rather than moving to another round.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}

I'm proposing a 45%/55% split which gives me a higher share than Alice's initial offer while still giving her the majority. This reflects the fact that inflation hurts me more than it hurts Alice, so we both have incentives to reach an agreement quickly. If we go to round 3, Alice's share would be subject to another 10% inflation, and my counteroffer gives her more value now than she might expect after further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully analyze this situation with the updated inflation rates.

Currently, Alice is offering me $400,000, which is better than her initial offer of $350,000. However, due to inflation, this $400,000 is worth 36% less than money in round 1, making it equivalent to $256,000 in round 1 value.

If I reject and move to round 4, my inflation will increase further (likely to around 49% from round 1 value), while Alice's will increase to about 27%. 

Since the inflation rate is hurting me significantly more than Alice, prolonging the negotiation works against me. Alice has improved her offer substantially from the first round, and considering the inflation dynamics, this is likely better than what I could achieve by continuing.

The asymmetric inflation rates create pressure on me to accept sooner rather than later, as my bargaining position weakens more quickly than Alice's.
