"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly. I'm offering you a decent chunk, and we both get something. Take it before things get worse! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: $1000 for me, $9000 for Alice
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But my money will be worth 20% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 10% less
   * This gives me leverage since inflation hurts me more

$1000 is only 10% of the total, which is quite low. Since inflation affects me more severely than Alice, I should make a counter-offer now while the money is still worth more.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a more balanced offer:

{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite uneven. This is a fair split considering we both face inflation, though yours is less severe. If you reject, you'll lose more value next round than I will.""}

Reasoning:
1. I'm offering Alice more than half (55%) to acknowledge her better inflation position
2. But I'm also ensuring I get a reasonable share (45%)
3. If she rejects, her $5500 will be worth $4950 next round (10% less)
4. My threat of future negotiations is credible because I've already shown I'm willing to reject unfair offers
5. The message emphasizes the mutual benefit of agreeing now"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright, Bob, let's try this again. I'm bumping up your share a bit. Take this deal now; it's the best you'll get. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice is offering $4000, but due to 36% inflation, it's only worth $2560 to me now
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make an offer
   * But my money will be worth 49.2% less than original value (another 20% drop)
   * Alice's money will be worth 27.1% less than original value (another 10% drop)
   * Any future negotiations will significantly erode my value

The offer is more balanced than the first one (40/60 split), but inflation has severely impacted its real value to me. However, if I reject, my negotiating position will be even weaker due to the asymmetric inflation rates.

Given that:
1. The nominal split is reasonable
2. Further delays will hurt me more than Alice
3. The real value will only get worse for me in future rounds
