60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, let's start with a more balanced split. I propose 55 for me and 45 for you. It's early in the game, and this is a reasonable compromise.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, due to the 10% inflation that affects my gains each round, I need a larger share to make up for the decreased value. Your previous offer of 45 was actually worth only 40.5 to me. This 65-35 split would be fair considering the inflation impact on my side.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, I understand the inflation is a concern for you, but I'm facing inflation as well. Let's meet in the middle. 60 for me, 40 for you. This considers the diminishing value for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
75.0,25.0,"Bob, the inflation is severely impacting my gains now - any amount I receive is worth 27.1% less than in round 1. Your offer of 40 would only be worth 29.16 to me in real terms. This 75-25 split would give me about 54.7 in real value, which is more reasonable given the inflation impact. We should reach an agreement soon before inflation reduces the value further.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
35.0,65.0,"Alice, the inflation is hurting us both. I am proposing 65 for me and 35 for you. This is the best offer I can make considering the circumstances. Let's take what we can while it's still worth something.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
85.0,15.0,"Bob, the situation is getting critical. Due to 40.95% inflation, any amount I receive is worth less than 60% of its nominal value. Your last offer of 35 would only be worth 20.67 to me in real terms. This 85-15 split would give me about 50.2 in real value after inflation, which is more balanced given the circumstances. We need to reach an agreement quickly - we're more than halfway through our rounds, and the inflation will only get worse.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, we are running out of time and the inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'm proposing 70 for me, 30 for you. This is a tough offer, but it's better than nothing. Let's secure something before it all vanishes.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
90.0,10.0,"Bob, we only have 3 rounds left after this one. The 52.17% inflation means I only get 47.83% of any nominal amount. Your last offer of 30 would only be worth 14.35 to me in real terms, while you get the full 70. Even this 90-10 split would only give me about 43 in real value after inflation. We must reach an agreement soon, or we both get nothing. Please consider this carefully - getting 10 is better than getting nothing if we fail to agree.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
20.0,80.0,"Alice, we have very little time left. I'm proposing a final offer of 80 for me and 20 for you. It's a difficult offer, I know, but the alternative is getting nothing. Please accept this, so we both get something out of this.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
95.0,5.0,"Bob, this is our second to last round. The 61.26% inflation means I get less than 39% of any nominal amount. Your last offer of 20 would only be worth 7.74 to me in real terms, while you get the full 80. Even with this 95-5 split, I would only get about 36.8 in real value. We have just ONE round left after this. Getting 5 is MUCH better than the zero we'll both receive if we don't agree. This is your last chance to get anything above zero.",Alice,11,
