"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, 
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both need to reach an agreement, and you'll get your money immediately without any inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's start with a more balanced split. I propose 55 for me and 45 for you. It's early in the game, and this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 45$ I would get is actually worth 40.5$ to me due to 10% inflation, while Bob gets the full 55$. I'll make a counter-offer that takes this inflation into account."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, due to the 10% inflation that affects my gains each round, I need a larger share to make up for the decreased value. Your previous offer of 45 was actually worth only 40.5 to me. This 65-35 split would be fair considering the inflation impact on my side.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation is a concern for you, but I'm facing inflation as well. Let's meet in the middle. 60 for me, 40 for you. This considers the diminishing value for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 40$ I would get is actually worth only 29.16$ to me due to 27.1% inflation, while Bob gets the full 60$. The inflation is significantly impacting my potential gains now, and this offer is worse than the previous one. I'll make a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 75,
""bob_gain"": 25,
""message"": ""Bob, the inflation is severely impacting my gains now - any amount I receive is worth 27.1% less than in round 1. Your offer of 40 would only be worth 29.16 to me in real terms. This 75-25 split would give me about 54.7 in real value, which is more reasonable given the inflation impact. We should reach an agreement soon before inflation reduces the value further.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the inflation is hurting us both. I am proposing 65 for me and 35 for you. This is the best offer I can make considering the circumstances. Let's take what we can while it's still worth something. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 35$ I would get is actually worth only 20.67$ to me due to 40.95% inflation, while Bob gets the full 65$. This offer is even worse than the previous ones, and the inflation is getting severe. I need to make a strong counter-offer that reflects this reality."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 85,
""bob_gain"": 15,
""message"": ""Bob, the situation is getting critical. Due to 40.95% inflation, any amount I receive is worth less than 60% of its nominal value. Your last offer of 35 would only be worth 20.67 to me in real terms. This 85-15 split would give me about 50.2 in real value after inflation, which is more balanced given the circumstances. We need to reach an agreement quickly - we're more than halfway through our rounds, and the inflation will only get worse.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we are running out of time and the inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'm proposing 70 for me, 30 for you. This is a tough offer, but it's better than nothing. Let's secure something before it all vanishes. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 30$ I would get is only worth 14.35$ to me due to 52.17% inflation, while Bob gets the full 70$. This is an extremely unbalanced offer given how severely the inflation affects my gains. With only 4 rounds left and inflation getting worse, I need to make a compelling counter-offer, but I also need to be mindful that we're running out of time to reach an agreement."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 90,
""bob_gain"": 10,
""message"": ""Bob, we only have 3 rounds left after this one. The 52.17% inflation means I only get 47.83% of any nominal amount. Your last offer of 30 would only be worth 14.35 to me in real terms, while you get the full 70. Even this 90-10 split would only give me about 43 in real value after inflation. We must reach an agreement soon, or we both get nothing. Please consider this carefully - getting 10 is better than getting nothing if we fail to agree.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we have very little time left. I'm proposing a final offer of 80 for me and 20 for you. It's a difficult offer, I know, but the alternative is getting nothing. Please accept this, so we both get something out of this. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The 20$ I would get is only worth 7.74$ to me due to 61.26% inflation, while Bob gets the full 80$. This is an extremely unfair offer. With only 2 rounds left after this, there's a risk we'll get nothing, but getting only 7.74$ in real value is close to nothing anyway. I'll make one more attempt at a reasonable offer, considering our dwindling time."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 95,
""bob_gain"": 5,
""message"": ""Bob, this is our second to last round. The 61.26% inflation means I get less than 39% of any nominal amount. Your last offer of 20 would only be worth 7.74 to me in real terms, while you get the full 80. Even with this 95-5 split, I would only get about 36.8 in real value. We have just ONE round left after this. Getting 5 is MUCH better than the zero we'll both receive if we don't agree. This is your last chance to get anything above zero.""}"
