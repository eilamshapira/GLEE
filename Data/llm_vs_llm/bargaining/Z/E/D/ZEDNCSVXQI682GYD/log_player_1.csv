"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split that slightly favors me since I'm making the first offer, but is still attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting rather than risking value loss due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

Let me explain my offer to Bob: I propose I get $55 and you get $45. This is a fair split considering I'm making the first move, and if you reject it, we'll both lose value due to 20% inflation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. If I accept, I get $40, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively I get $32
2. If I reject, we go to round 3 where I can make a new offer, but the money will be worth another 20% less
3. My original offer of $55 would now be worth $44 after inflation, and even less in the next round
4. If I reject, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round, and the value will continue to decrease

Given this analysis, I should accept this offer as further negotiations will likely lead to even lower real values for both of us.
