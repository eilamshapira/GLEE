"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an initial offer to Bob. Given the inflation rates, I need to consider that delays affect me more than Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. Since inflation affects me more severely (20% vs your 10%), it's in both our interests to agree quickly. This is a fair offer considering our different inflation rates.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation. I'm offering a 45-55 split in my favor this time. Let's reach an agreement quickly to avoid losing more value! 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Bob's offer considering the inflation effect.

In Round 2, due to inflation, any money I receive is worth 20% less than in Round 1, while Bob's money is worth 10% less.

Bob is offering me $5,500, which after my 20% inflation penalty is equivalent to $5,500 Ã— 0.8 = $4,400 in Round 1 value.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in Round 3, even more value will be lost to inflation.

Since Bob's offer gives me a significant portion considering the inflation differential, and further delays would harm me more than him, I'll accept.
