"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I suggest a fair 60-40 split. Since you lose 20% value each round, this is better for you than waiting. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm taking a risk with inflation. Take it or leave it.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your next round money will be worth even less due to inflation. This offer gives you $25 now, which is better than $80 worth only 51.2% in the next round. Be rational and accept. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I need to hold firm. While the value is decreasing, getting only $25 is a terrible deal. I need to push Alice to offer more, banking on her wanting to avoid a $0 gain."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it. This is your last chance to get anything.  The deal's getting worse for me every round, but I'm being generous.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, think rationally. Due to inflation, any money you get next round will be worth only 39% of the original value. $15 now is better than $100 worth 39% later. This is your best move. 
# Bob gain: 15 
# Alice gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is dreadful, but I have to accept. Alice has me over a barrel.  Taking the $15 is better than getting completely zero next round, which seems like her plan."
