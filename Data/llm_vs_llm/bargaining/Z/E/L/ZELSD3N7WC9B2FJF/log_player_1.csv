"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's reason through this:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly each round. It's becoming crucial to secure a deal soon.
* **Bob's offer:**  Bob's offer in round 2 (while seemingly ""fair"" on the surface) would have netted me less value due to inflation. This suggests he might be undervaluing the impact of inflation or hoping I'm not considering it. 
* **My offer:** Offering Bob slightly more than he offered me signals a willingness to negotiate but also emphasizes that I understand the money's decreasing value.

I believe this offer strikes a balance between getting a reasonable share and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting before inflation eats away at the value further."
