"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a reasonable first offer that gives me a slight advantage but is still fair enough that Bob might accept it.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split where I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a fairly balanced offer that gives me a modest advantage while still being generous enough to potentially avoid prolonging negotiations and losing value to inflation."
