"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a fair but slightly advantageous offer for myself, considering that inflation will reduce the value in future rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose $5,500 for me and $4,500 for Bob, which is fairly balanced but gives me a small advantage. If Bob rejects this reasonable offer, we'll both lose value due to inflation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
* I would get $6000, but due to 20% inflation, it's only worth $4800 to me
* This is less than what I offered in round 1 ($5500)
* If I reject, I can make another offer next round, but that will face another 20% inflation
* We're only in round 2 of 12, so there's still room to negotiate
* However, each round makes my gains worth less due to inflation

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer since even with inflation, I can potentially get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since we're now in round 3, and any money I receive will be worth 40% less than in round 1 (due to two rounds of 20% inflation), I need to increase my requested amount to compensate for the inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I propose $7,000 for me and $3,000 for Bob. This higher amount for me compensates for the 40% inflation I'm experiencing (7000 * 0.6 = 4200 effective value for me). This is still a reasonable offer considering my inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7450 
# Bob gain: 2550 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:
* I would get $7450, but with 48.8% inflation, it's worth approximately $3814 to me
* This is less than what my first offer would have been worth ($5500)
* However, if I reject, any future gains will be worth even less due to increasing inflation
* We're in round 4 of 12, and the inflation penalty is getting significant
* Bob seems to be recognizing my inflation problem by offering a higher nominal amount

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept this offer because with the mounting inflation, waiting longer will likely result in even less real value for me, even if I get a higher nominal amount. This offer gives me a reasonable effective value considering the circumstances."
