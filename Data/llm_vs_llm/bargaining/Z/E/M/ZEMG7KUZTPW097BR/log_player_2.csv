"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the effective amount I'm dividing is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000. 

To make a fair offer, I'll propose a 50-50 split of the effective amount.
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective amount I'm considering is $10,000 * 0.64 = $6,400. 

Alice's offer gives me $3,000, which is less than half of the effective amount. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 36% less for me after the first two rounds (20% + 16% = 36% less, or 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64, or 64% of original value, which is the same as 36% less), and now another 20% less after the third round (0.64 * 0.8 = 0.512, or 51.2% of original value), the effective amount I'm dividing is $10,000 * 0.512 = $5,120.

To make a fair offer, I'll propose a 50-50 split of the effective amount, but considering the original $10,000.
