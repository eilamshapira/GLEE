"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I want to secure a good outcome for myself while also ensuring Bob accepts the offer to avoid us both getting nothing.

Here's my first offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning: I'm offering Bob $4000, which is a significant amount. Hopefully, this will be enough to entice him to accept the offer rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds. I'm prioritizing securing a larger portion for myself early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob is trying to take a larger share. While I'd prefer more, we're in round 2 and I want to avoid a protracted negotiation that leads to nothing. $4500 is still a decent amount.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
