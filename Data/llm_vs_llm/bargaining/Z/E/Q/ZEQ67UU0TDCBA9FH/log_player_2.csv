"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","While Alice's offer gives me $4000, which is a significant amount, I could potentially get a more favorable split in the next round when it's my turn to make a proposal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split that's slightly in my favor, but still fair to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering you $4500, Alice, which is quite fair. This gives us both a substantial amount, and I think it balances our interests well. I hope you'll find this acceptable so we can both walk away with a good outcome."
