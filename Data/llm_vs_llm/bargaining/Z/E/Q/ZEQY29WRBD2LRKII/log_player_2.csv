"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's keep it simple and fair by splitting the amount equally. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","While a 50-50 split might initially seem fair, I need to consider the inflation factor. Since the money loses 20% of its value for me each round, accepting now gives me the full $5,000. If I reject and we go to the next round, my potential share would be affected by inflation.
