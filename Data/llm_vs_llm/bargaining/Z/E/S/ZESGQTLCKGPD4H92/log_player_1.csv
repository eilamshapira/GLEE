I'm offering a very generous split to Bob, hoping he'll accept it in the first round. This leaves me with the majority of the money, and it's worth remembering that his share will be worth 20% less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
