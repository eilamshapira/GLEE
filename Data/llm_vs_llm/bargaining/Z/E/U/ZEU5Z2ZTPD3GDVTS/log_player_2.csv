"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I can make my own offer in the next round
3. But waiting comes with a 5% inflation penalty, meaning the money will be worth less
4. If I reject, the $5000 would effectively become $4750 in the next round due to inflation
5. Making a more aggressive offer might result in Alice rejecting, leading to further rounds and more inflation losses

Given that it's a fair split and the risk of losing value to inflation, I'll accept.
