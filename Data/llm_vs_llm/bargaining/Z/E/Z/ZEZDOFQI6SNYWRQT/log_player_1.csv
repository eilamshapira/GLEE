"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I should make a strong initial offer considering that inflation will affect my gains by 20% each round but won't affect Bob's gains. However, I also need to make it attractive enough for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I offer Bob 400,000$ (40%) and keep 600,000$ (60%) for myself. This is a fair initial offer that acknowledges both my time pressure due to inflation and Bob's power to reject and counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- Bob is offering a 50-50 split
- Due to 20% inflation, my $500,000 would actually be worth $400,000 to me
- If I reject, my next offer would be subject to 40% inflation, making each dollar worth only 60 cents to me
- Bob knows he has the advantage due to inflation only affecting me
- Further rounds will only decrease my purchasing power

While I could reject and try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes this risky. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush, especially with inflation.
