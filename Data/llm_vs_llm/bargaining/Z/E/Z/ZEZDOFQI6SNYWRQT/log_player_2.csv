"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since it's round 2, and I'm Bob, the value of the money for me has decreased by 0%. For Alice, the value has decreased by 20% from the original value in round 1.

To maximize my gain, I'll propose a division that is slightly more favorable to me than the previous offer, knowing Alice's value of the money has decreased. I'll aim to get close to half while being slightly generous to incentivize acceptance.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""alice_gain"": 500000
}
```"
