"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to factor in the inflation for both myself and Bob when making my offer.

Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning is that I'm offering Bob a significant portion of the money upfront, which should be attractive considering his inflation rate. I'm also keeping a slightly larger share for myself to account for my own inflation."
