"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully considering the inflation factors.

If I reject and make my own offer in the next round, the total value would be 20% less valuable to me, so the $100 would effectively be worth $80 to me. Similarly, for Alice, the $100 would be worth $95 in the next round (5% less).

Alice is offering me $20 now, which is 20% of the current value. If I reject and go to the next round, I would need to secure more than $25 ($20 รท 0.8) to make it worthwhile, and Alice would also need to accept my offer.

Given the asymmetric inflation rates, I think I can make a better offer that Alice might accept, so I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I need to propose a fair offer that Alice would accept, considering our respective inflation rates.

Since we're now in round 2, the money is worth 20% less to me and 5% less to Alice compared to round 1. If Alice rejects my offer, in round 3 the money would be worth 36% less to me and 9.75% less to Alice compared to round 1.

I should propose a division that gives Alice enough incentive to accept rather than waiting for round 3. Given that Alice initially proposed keeping 80%, I'll offer a more balanced split that still favors her (since she has less inflation pressure) but is significantly better for me than her initial offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate this offer considering our current inflation rates.

At this point, the $100 is worth 36% less to me (so $100 is effectively worth $64), and 9.75% less to Alice (so $100 is effectively worth $90.25 to her).

Alice is offering me $25. Let me compare this to what would happen if I reject:
- If I reject, we go to round 4, where my inflation would be even higher (roughly 49% less valuable than round 1)
- The $25 now is equivalent to about $39.06 in round 1 value for me ($25 รท 0.64)
- To make rejection worthwhile, I would need to secure more than $49.02 in round 4 ($25 รท 0.51), which seems unlikely given Alice's previous behavior

Given the significant inflation penalty I face and the fact that Alice's offering a bit more than her initial offer (adjusted for inflation), I should accept this offer.
