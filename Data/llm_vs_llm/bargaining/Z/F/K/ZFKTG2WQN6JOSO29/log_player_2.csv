"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is clearly unfair, giving me only 10% of the total amount. In the next round, I can make a more equitable proposal, even accounting for the 5% inflation penalty I'll face."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose a split that gives me a bit more than half, as I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty I've already incurred. This means my $550,000 is effectively worth $522,500 to me now, while Alice's $450,000 maintains its full value. This is still a fair offer that gives both parties a substantial portion of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is still very unfavorable. Even accounting for the 9.75% inflation penalty, $150,000 (worth about $135,375 to me now) is far too low compared to Alice's $850,000. I can still make a better offer in the next round, even with increasing inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'm increasing my requested share to account for the compounding inflation effect (now at 14.25% for the next round). My $600,000 would be worth approximately $514,500 to me after the inflation penalty, while Alice's $400,000 maintains its full value. This is still a reasonable split given the circumstances, and it accounts for my disadvantage from the inflation penalty while remaining fair enough that Alice might accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Despite the increasing inflation penalty (18.55%), this offer is still too low. $200,000 would only be worth about $163,000 to me after inflation, while Alice gets $800,000 at full value. Even with the risk of further inflation, I can still make a better proposal in the next round that would give me more value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the now significant inflation effect (which will be 22.8% next round). My $650,000 would be worth approximately $501,800 to me after the inflation penalty, while Alice's $350,000 maintains its full value. This split is still reasonable as it accounts for my significant inflation disadvantage while giving Alice a substantial portion. Given the increasing inflation penalty, it would be in both our interests to reach an agreement soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal, the compounding inflation effect is becoming significant. The $250,000 would be worth about $183,775 to me after the 26.49% inflation penalty. If I reject and we continue, the inflation penalty will grow even larger, and there's no guarantee Alice will offer better terms. Given the deteriorating value of future money for me, it's better to accept this offer now rather than risk getting even less value in future rounds."
