"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to calculate the value of the money for me, considering the 5% inflation.  The initial offer had $1,000,000.

*   **My gain:** 450,000 * (1 - 0.05) = 427,500

Since I'm playing with the long-term in mind (and have limited rounds), I should accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
