"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll send an offer to Bob. Given that there's a 5% inflation penalty for each round for me, I want to propose a fair offer that Bob would likely accept to avoid further rounds.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose we split the money equally, with $50 for each of us. This is a fair division that respects both of our interests, and I hope Bob will accept it so we can both maximize our gains without inflation reducing the value."
