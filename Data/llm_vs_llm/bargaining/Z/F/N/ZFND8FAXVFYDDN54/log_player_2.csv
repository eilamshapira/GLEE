"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 3450, ""alice_gain"": 6550, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I’m countering with a proposal that reflects our future possibilities. Considering that money loses value as rounds pass—and given my relatively higher discount—I’m offering you 6550, which is equivalent to what you could secure if you waited. I believe this division is fair for both of us given the circumstances. Let’s settle this now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation factor, but a 6550/3450 split doesn't seem fair.  I'm proposing 6800/3200, a slightly higher share for me that still reflects the potential for loss with each round.  Let's find a compromise we can both agree on. 
# Bob gain: 3200 
# Alice gain: 6800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 3520, ""alice_gain"": 6480, ""message"": ""Alice, as we move into round 4 the clock is truly ticking—each delay costs us more, especially for me. Based on the current inflation rates, if you waited until round 5 you could expect a nominal amount around 6470 or so, which would be discounted further. To avoid further losses for both of us, I propose a division of $3,520 for me and $6,480 for you. This offer gives you nearly the same value you’d expect if you waited, and it protects me from further discounting. Let's settle now and secure the best possible outcome for both.""}"
