"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is offering me 40% of the money while taking 60% for herself, which doesn't seem fair given that an even split would be 50-50. I need to consider the inflation factor though - with each round, the money becomes worth 5% less to me, while Alice doesn't face any inflation penalty.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be worth 5% less to me, meaning the $100 would effectively be worth $95 from my perspective. I should reject this offer and propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I face a 5% inflation penalty per round, I should propose a fair split that accounts for this disadvantage. I'll offer a more equitable division that's slightly in my favor to compensate for the time pressure I face.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor. This is reasonable considering I'm at a disadvantage with the 5% inflation penalty each round, while Alice faces no such penalty. This offer still gives Alice a substantial portion while recognizing my time constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me from 40 to 45, while taking 55 for herself. I need to consider that:

1. We're now in round 3, and I've already lost 9.75% value due to inflation
2. If I reject and we go to round 4, I'll lose approximately 15% value due to inflation
3. Each round we spend negotiating hurts me more than Alice

While I'd prefer an even split or better, the inflation penalty means I should be more willing to accept a reasonable offer. Alice has moved considerably from her initial offer, and the current split is not too far from equal.

Given the inflation pressure, this is a reasonable offer that I should accept.
