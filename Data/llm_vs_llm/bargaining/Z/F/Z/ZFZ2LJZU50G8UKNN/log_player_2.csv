"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the inflation risk. This offer gives you a substantial amount while ensuring I'm protected from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4,500 out of $10,000
2. While this isn't a 50-50 split, it's still a substantial amount
3. I don't lose any value to inflation, so there's no risk in accepting now
4. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, but Alice might reject it, leading to more rounds
5. The split (45%-55%) is reasonably fair

Given these factors, especially considering that I don't face any inflation risk and the split is reasonably fair, I'll accept this offer.
