2000.0,8000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that you receive $8000 and I take $2000. If you wait until round 2, you’d be in the position to propose—but your share will be discounted by 20%, leaving you with roughly the same value. Accepting this offer now avoids any further loss in value for both of us. Let's settle this swiftly!",Alice,1,
