"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that you receive $8000 and I take $2000. If you wait until round 2, you’d be in the position to propose—but your share will be discounted by 20%, leaving you with roughly the same value. Accepting this offer now avoids any further loss in value for both of us. Let's settle this swiftly! 
# Bob gain: 8000 
# Alice gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current offer: I get $8000, Alice gets $2000
2. If I reject:
   * Next round I can make a proposal
   * My money will be worth 20% less
   * Alice's money will be worth 10% less
   * $8000 × 0.8 = $6400 effective value for me in next round

Alice is right - even if I make a more favorable proposal next round, the 20% depreciation means I'm unlikely to get much better than the current $8000 value.

This is actually a very generous first offer from Alice, offering me 80% of the total. Given the depreciation rates and that she could have started with a much lower offer, this is an excellent deal.
