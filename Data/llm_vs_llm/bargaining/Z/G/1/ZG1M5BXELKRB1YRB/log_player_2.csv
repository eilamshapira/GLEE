"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is the first round, so there's no inflation effect yet
2. Alice is offering me 40% of the total ($4000)
3. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the money will be worth 20% less to me
4. $4000 now is worth more than $5000+ in the next round due to inflation
5. While I could try to negotiate for more, the risk of losing value through inflation and potential further negotiations makes this a reasonable offer
