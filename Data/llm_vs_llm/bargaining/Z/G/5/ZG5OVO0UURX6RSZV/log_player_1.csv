"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a slightly favorable split for me, but still fair enough that Bob might accept to avoid inflation affecting his share.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because getting $450,000 now might be more attractive to Bob than risking the 5% inflation and waiting for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. If I accept, I get $450,000 at 95% value = $427,500 effective value
2. If I reject, we go to next round where:
   - Money will be worth even less (90% for me)
   - I'll have another chance to make an offer
   - But there's risk of further back-and-forth and value loss

Given that the difference between Bob's offer and my initial proposal isn't too large, and considering the inflation risk, I'll accept this offer to secure a reasonable amount rather than risk further devaluation.
