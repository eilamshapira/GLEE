"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me 400,000$ out of 1,000,000$, which is 40% of the total amount. While this isn't an even split, it's still a substantial amount of money. 

However, if I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round. Since Alice demonstrated she's willing to take a larger share, she might reject a perfectly fair 50-50 split. But she might accept something like 450,000$ for me and 550,000$ for her.

Given that there's risk in rejection (Alice might make an even worse offer next time), and 400,000$ is still a significant sum, I'll accept this offer.
