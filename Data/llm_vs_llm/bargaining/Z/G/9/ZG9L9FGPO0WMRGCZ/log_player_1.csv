Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I value fairness and efficiency. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor to account for the slight delay cost on my end. I believe this division is reasonable and avoids further complications. What do you think?

# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time works against you due to inflation. If you reject now, as the next proposer you'll face even harsher constraints because my value remains full while yours is discounted. I'm offering you $1 nowâ€”which, though it may seem small, is far better than the near-zero alternative if we delay further. Accept and let's conclude this efficiently. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99
