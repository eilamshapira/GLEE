600000.0,400000.0,Let's split it fairly considering the inflation rates. This offer gives you a good share while accounting for the devaluation.,Alice,1,

285714.0,714286.0,"Alice, by accepting this offer now, you secure an effective payout that’s higher than what you’d get if we delay further. I’m offering you 28.57% of the pie (which amounts to $285714 nominally) so that your actual value is $228571 at current devaluation. Let’s agree and avoid further loss due to inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Let's split it evenly this time. Given the inflation rates, this is a fair deal for both of us. Accepting this offer will minimize further losses for both parties.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Alice, delaying further will only hurt both of us. If you reject this round, you'll get to propose in round 5 when, due to your higher devaluation (only 40.96% of each dollar’s original value), you could at best secure nearly the entire 1000000—that amounts to an effective 409600 in today’s terms. To match that future outcome while avoiding further losses, I'm offering you $800000 nominally in round 4 (worth about 0.512 × 800000 = 409600), leaving me $200000 (worth 0.729 × 200000 = 145800). I believe this is the minimum acceptable deal for you given the steep depreciation you face. Let’s agree now rather than suffer deeper losses.",Bob,4,
