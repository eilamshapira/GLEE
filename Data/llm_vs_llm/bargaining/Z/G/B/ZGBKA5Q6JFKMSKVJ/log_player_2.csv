"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the inflation rates. This offer gives you a good share while accounting for the devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 714286, ""alice_gain"": 285714, ""message"": ""Alice, by accepting this offer now, you secure an effective payout that’s higher than what you’d get if we delay further. I’m offering you 28.57% of the pie (which amounts to $285,714 nominally) so that your actual value is $228,571 at current devaluation. Let’s agree and avoid further loss due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. Given the inflation rates, this is a fair deal for both of us. Accepting this offer will minimize further losses for both parties. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 200000, ""alice_gain"": 800000, ""message"": ""Alice, delaying further will only hurt both of us. If you reject this round, you'll get to propose in round 5 when, due to your higher devaluation (only 40.96% of each dollar’s original value), you could at best secure nearly the entire 1,000,000—that amounts to an effective 409,600 in today’s terms. To match that future outcome while avoiding further losses, I'm offering you $800,000 nominally in round 4 (worth about 0.512 × 800,000 = 409,600), leaving me $200,000 (worth 0.729 × 200,000 = 145,800). I believe this is the minimum acceptable deal for you given the steep depreciation you face. Let’s agree now rather than suffer deeper losses.""}"
