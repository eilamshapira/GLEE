"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose we split the money $55 for me and $45 for you, Bob. This is a fair offer that gives us both a substantial amount, and accepting now means we avoid the 10% inflation penalty in the next round."
