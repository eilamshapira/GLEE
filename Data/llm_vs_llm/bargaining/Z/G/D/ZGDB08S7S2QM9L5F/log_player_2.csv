"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $45 and keeping $55
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, the total amount will decrease by 10% (to $90 total)
4. My potential maximum in the next round would be less than $90

This is a fairly reasonable first offer, close to 50-50. While slightly in Alice's favor, rejecting would mean losing $10 in total value, making it unlikely I'd end up with more than $45 after the 10% inflation.
