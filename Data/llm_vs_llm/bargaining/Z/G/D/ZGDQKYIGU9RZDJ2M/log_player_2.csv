"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically. Alice is offering me $450,000, which is 45% of the total amount. While it's slightly less than half, it's still a substantial sum, and we have the pressure of potentially losing everything if we don't reach an agreement within 12 rounds.

Given that:
1. This is a very reasonable first offer
2. The amount I would receive is significant
3. There's a risk of getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers
4. Even if I counter-offer, Alice might reject and we'd waste rounds

I will accept this offer.
