"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. If I reject, I can propose in the next round, but due to the 5% inflation, the $100 total will be worth only $95 to me, while still worth $100 to Alice.

If I accept now, I get $40.
If I reject and make a counter-offer, the maximum I could get in theory would be around $95, but Alice would need to accept my proposal.

Let me reject this offer so I can make a counter-proposal in the next round. While I lose 5% to inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a proposal that acknowledges the inflation factor while still being fair enough that Alice might accept it.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing that I receive $55 and Alice receives $45. This is slightly more favorable to me, but still gives Alice a substantial portion. Since I'm facing a 5% inflation penalty for each round, it's important that we reach an agreement soon. This offer gives us both a good outcome and avoids further devaluation of the total amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate this offer carefully considering the inflation effect.

Alice is now offering me $43, which due to the 9.75% inflation is actually worth about $38.81 to me in round 1 value.

If I reject and we move to round 4, I'll face even more inflation (around 14.5% total), meaning the entire $100 would only be worth about $85.5 to me. Even if I proposed a more favorable split, Alice might reject again, leading to further devaluation.

Alice has increased her offer from $40 to $43, showing some willingness to compromise. Given the inflation penalty I'm facing, the improving offer trend, and the risk of further devaluation, I should accept this offer.
