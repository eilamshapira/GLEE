"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual amount I'm dividing is 800,000 (1,000,000 * 0.8). For Alice, it's worth 10% less, so she considers it as 900,000 (1,000,000 * 0.9). However, the game's rules imply that we're negotiating over the original $1,000,000, with the value reduction affecting our perception of its worth in subsequent rounds.

Given this, I'll make an offer considering the original amount for simplicity, but keeping in mind the diminishing value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This is my final offer before the stakes get even lower for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the diminishing value:
- For me, the money is worth 64% of its original value (1 - 0.36 = 0.64).
- For Alice, the money is worth 81% of its original value (1 - 0.19 = 0.81).

Given Alice's offer:
- My gain would be 400,000 * 0.64 = 256,000 (in terms of original value).
- Alice's gain would be 600,000 * 0.81 = 486,000 (in terms of original value).

This offer still seems to favor Alice significantly.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the value reduction:
- The money is worth 64% of its original value for me, and it will decrease further.
- For Alice, it's worth 81% of its original value.

To make a fair offer, I'll consider the original $1,000,000, but keep in mind the value reductions.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this back-and-forth is costing us both.  Take this offer before the inflation eats away even more. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the diminishing value:
- For me, the money is worth 40.96% of its original value (1 - 0.5904 = 0.4096).
- For Alice, the money is worth 65.61% of its original value (1 - 0.3439 = 0.6561).

Given Alice's offer:
- My gain would be 430,000 * 0.4096 = 176,208 (in terms of original value).
- Alice's gain would be 570,000 * 0.6561 = 374,347 (in terms of original value).

This offer still seems to favor Alice, and the value reduction for me is significant. However, considering the rapid decrease in value, I should weigh the option of accepting a less favorable deal against the risk of losing even more value in subsequent rounds.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the value reduction:
- For me, the money is worth 40.96% of its original value, and it will decrease further.
- For Alice, it's worth 65.61% of its original value.

To make a competitive offer, I'll aim for a split that reflects the diminishing values but still tries to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it. The clock is ticking and we both lose if we don't agree now. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the diminishing value:
- For me, the money is worth 26.21% of its original value (1 - 0.7379 = 0.2621).
- For Alice, the money is worth 53.14% of its original value (1 - 0.4686 = 0.5314).

Given Alice's offer:
- My gain would be 460,000 * 0.2621 = 120,466 (in terms of original value).
- Alice's gain would be 540,000 * 0.5314 = 286,956 (in terms of original value).

At this point, the value reduction is severe for me, and the difference in perceived value between Alice and me is significant. However, considering this is Alice's ""final offer"" and the risk of losing even more value (potentially everything) if we don't agree, I should consider accepting this offer to secure some value rather than risking getting nothing.
