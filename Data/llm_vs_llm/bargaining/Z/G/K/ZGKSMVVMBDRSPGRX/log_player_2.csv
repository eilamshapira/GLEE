"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I hope we can reach a fair agreement that benefits us both! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer strategically:

1. Current offer: $4000 for me, $6000 for Alice
2. If I reject and move to next round:
   - The money will be worth 10% less to me
   - Maximum I could propose would be worth only 90% of current value
   - $10,000 Ã— 0.9 = $9,000 effective value for me next round

While $4000 isn't exactly a 50-50 split, it's still a significant amount. If I reject, I risk:
1. Getting a worse deal next round
2. Losing value due to inflation
3. Alice potentially rejecting my counter-offer, leading to even more inflation loss

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer. While not perfect, it's reasonable enough considering the inflation risk.
