"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to Bob in Round 1.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'd like to propose a slightly favorable split for myself, but still giving Bob a substantial amount. Since I'm facing 5% inflation per round, I need to secure a good deal early, but I also want to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept rather than reject and counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer to Bob in Round 3.

{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000}

I'm adjusting my offer to be more favorable to Bob compared to my first proposal, but still ensuring I get a fair portion. Given the 10% effective inflation I've already experienced, I need to find a balance that's attractive enough for Bob to accept while protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000
