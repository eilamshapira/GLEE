"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a fair split that accounts for the 20% inflation risk I face if we go to another round.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose I get $5,500 and you get $4,500. This is a reasonable split considering I need to account for the inflation risk I face in future rounds."
