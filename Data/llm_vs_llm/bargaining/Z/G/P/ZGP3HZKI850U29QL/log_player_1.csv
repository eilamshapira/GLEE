"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the 20% depreciation per round for Bob. Since he might be tempted to wait for the next round, I'll offer him a favorable split to encourage immediate acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose $600,000 for me and $400,000 for Bob. This is a reasonable 60-40 split that gives Bob a significant portion. If he declines and waits for the next round, his money will be worth 20% less, so it's in his interest to accept now."
