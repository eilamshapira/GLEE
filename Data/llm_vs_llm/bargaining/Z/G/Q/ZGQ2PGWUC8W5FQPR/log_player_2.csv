"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer since Alice is trying to take a significantly larger share (60%) without any justification. As Bob, I think I deserve a more equitable split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split, slightly in my favor since Alice tried to take advantage in the first round, but still reasonable enough that she should accept rather than risk further inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}

I propose this fair division where we both get close to half, with me getting slightly more as compensation for Alice's initial unfair offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. While it's not a perfect 50-50 split, it's a more reasonable offer than Alice's first proposal. Given that we've already lost almost 10% to inflation and might lose more if we continue negotiating, it's better to accept now. Getting $4,500 (worth about $4,061 after inflation) is better than risking further devaluation of the total amount.
