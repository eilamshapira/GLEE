"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob's offer.

Due to inflation, my money is worth 5% less. Let's calculate the value of the money I would receive.

In the first round, $100 was the total value. In this round, the total value for me is $100 * 0.95 = $95. So, I need to consider how much $45 would actually be worth to me.

I am offered $45, which is worth $45 to me.

Given the parameters of the game, I will:

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 3, considering the inflation:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```"
