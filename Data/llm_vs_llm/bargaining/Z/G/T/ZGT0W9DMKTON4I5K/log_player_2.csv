"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice offered me $40, keeping $60 for herself. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round. Since Alice faces a 5% inflation penalty per round, her $60 would be worth $57 to her in the next round. This gives me negotiating leverage.

I could offer a more favorable split next round, knowing that her money is worth less to her. She would need to weigh accepting a potentially better offer against the 5% loss in value.

Given this advantage, I'll reject this first offer to negotiate for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a strategic counter-offer. Given that:
1. Alice faces 5% inflation per round
2. If she rejects my offer, her next proposal would be worth 5% less to her
3. I don't face any inflation penalty

I'll propose a more favorable split for me, but not so extreme that she would definitely reject it:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This offer is more balanced than her initial proposal, giving me the majority but leaving Alice with a significant portion. Since she knows that waiting another round will cost her 5% in value, she has an incentive to accept this offer now rather than continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has moved from her initial 40/60 split to a 50/50 split
2. Due to inflation, her $50 is actually worth only about $45.13 to her (50 * 0.9025)
3. My $50 maintains full value since I don't face inflation
4. If I reject, we go to round 4, where her money would be worth about 14.75% less

The 50/50 split is quite fair from my perspective, and I'm getting $10 more than in her initial offer. While I could potentially negotiate for more by rejecting (since Alice faces increasing inflation pressure), there's also a risk that continued negotiation could lead to a worse outcome.

Given that this is a reasonable offer and I'm getting full value while Alice is already facing nearly 10% inflation, I'll accept this offer.
