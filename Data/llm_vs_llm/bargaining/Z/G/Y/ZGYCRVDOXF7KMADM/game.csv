4000.0,6000.0,"I appreciate the sentiment of a 50/50 split Alice, but considering the inflation, I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?",Bob,2,
,,"I understand your point about inflation, Bob, but a 60/40 split seems a bit steep considering we started with an equal split. How about we meet in the middle with a 55/45 split in your favor?",Alice,2,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Considering your concerns about inflation and our previous discussions, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in your favor, Bob. This way, we both get a fair deal, and we can end this before the value drops further for me.",Alice,3,
