"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the sentiment of a 50/50 split Alice, but considering the inflation, I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. How about a 60/40 split in my favor? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I understand your point about inflation, Bob, but a 60/40 split seems a bit steep considering we started with an equal split. How about we meet in the middle with a 55/45 split in your favor?""
