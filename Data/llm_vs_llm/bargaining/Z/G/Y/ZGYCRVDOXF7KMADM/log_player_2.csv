"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly down the middle, Bob. 50-50 sounds good, right?

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate the sentiment of a 50/50 split Alice, but considering the inflation, I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your concerns about inflation and our previous discussions, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in your favor, Bob. This way, we both get a fair deal, and we can end this before the value drops further for me. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
