5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money evenly. This is fair for both of us, and we'll both walk away with a good amount. With our different inflation rates (20% for me vs 5% for you), delaying doesn't benefit either of us. Let's agree now and both win.",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, considering our different inflation rates (20% vs 5%), waiting another round will hurt you significantly more than me. This 60-40 split in my favor is still better for you than getting 50% next round, which would only be worth 80% of its current value. Let's make a deal now and both benefit.",Bob,2,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but your proposed split was too extreme. Consider that we both lose if we keep rejecting offers. This 52-48 split slightly favors me to offset the higher inflation I face. It's fair and gives us both substantial value - you'd get $4800 that's only lost 10% value so far. If we continue to the next round, we both face more significant losses due to inflation.",Alice,3,
