"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob that is fair but takes into account our different inflation penalties.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money evenly. This is fair for both of us, and we'll both walk away with a good amount. With our different inflation rates (20% for me vs 5% for you), delaying doesn't benefit either of us. Let's agree now and both win.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering our different inflation rates (20% vs 5%), waiting another round will hurt you significantly more than me. This 60-40 split in my favor is still better for you than getting 50% next round, which would only be worth 80% of its current value. Let's make a deal now and both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800, 
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but your proposed split was too extreme. Consider that we both lose if we keep rejecting offers. This 52-48 split slightly favors me to offset the higher inflation I face. It's fair and gives us both substantial value - you'd get $4,800 that's only lost 10% value so far. If we continue to the next round, we both face more significant losses due to inflation.""}"
