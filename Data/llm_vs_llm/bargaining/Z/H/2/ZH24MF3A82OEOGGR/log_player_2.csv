"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest we split the money evenly. This is fair for both of us, and we'll both walk away with a good amount. With our different inflation rates (20% for me vs 5% for you), delaying doesn't benefit either of us. Let's agree now and both win. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is right that delay hurts both of us due to inflation, but it hurts her more (20% vs my 5%). This gives me some negotiating leverage.

If I reject now:
- Next round I can propose a split more in my favor
- My money will be worth 95% of current value
- Her money will be worth 80% of current value
- This significant difference in inflation rates means she'll be more pressured to accept a less favorable deal

While a 50-50 split might seem fair at first glance, I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making my own proposal next round, taking advantage of the inflation differential.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that I have leverage due to the different inflation rates, I'll propose a split that's more in my favor while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept to avoid the severe inflation penalty she faces.

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, considering our different inflation rates (20% vs 5%), waiting another round will hurt you significantly more than me. This 60-40 split in my favor is still better for you than getting 50% next round, which would only be worth 80% of its current value. Let's make a deal now and both benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but your proposed split was too extreme. Consider that we both lose if we keep rejecting offers. This 52-48 split slightly favors me to offset the higher inflation I face. It's fair and gives us both substantial value - you'd get $4800 that's only lost 10% value so far. If we continue to the next round, we both face more significant losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice's offer gives me $4800, which due to 9.75% inflation is worth about $4,332
2. If I reject and we continue:
   - Next round I can propose again
   - But my money will be worth another 5% less
   - Her money will be worth another 20% less
   - She's already facing 36% inflation on her portion

While I could hold out for a better deal, Alice makes a valid point about mutual losses. The inflation is starting to become significant, and there's a risk of losing everything if we can't agree within the rounds limit. Her current offer is reasonable given the circumstances - I still get a substantial amount, and the slight tilt in her favor does help offset her higher inflation rate.
