"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make my offer for dividing the $10,000. Given that we're in the first round and I'm facing a 10% decrease in value with each passing round, I'll propose a fair split that incentivizes Bob to accept early.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose an equal 50-50 split of the money. This is the fairest way to divide the amount, giving us each half of the total. Let's settle this now so we can both walk away with a good outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer for round 3. Since I now understand Bob is facing less inflation pressure than I am (5% per round for Bob vs 10% per round for me), I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, 
""bob_gain"": 4800}

I'm proposing I receive $5,200 and Bob receives $4,800. This slightly favors me to compensate for my higher inflation rate. It's still a reasonable split that gives Bob a substantial amount, and accepting now is better for both of us than continuing to later rounds where inflation will reduce our total value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I need to be more strategic given our different inflation rates and Bob's behavior. Since I'm facing a 10% inflation per round versus Bob's 5%, and we're now in round 5, I'll make an offer that recognizes this asymmetry while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, 
""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing I receive $5,500 and Bob receives $4,500. This adjustment accounts for my higher inflation rate which is significantly impacting my potential gains. Accepting this offer now is in both our interests rather than continuing further rounds where our combined value will decrease further. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away with a reasonable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4250 
# Bob gain: 5750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I see that we're now in round 7, and the inflation differences are becoming more pronounced. I need to make a more compelling offer considering my 10% inflation per round versus Bob's 5%, while recognizing that we both lose if we can't reach an agreement.

{""alice_gain"": 5800, 
""bob_gain"": 4200}

I'm proposing I receive $5,800 and Bob receives $4,200. This takes into account the significant inflation disadvantage I'm facing. By round 7, my money is worth over 40% less than at the start, while Bob's is only about 23% less. This offer aims to balance our actual takeaways when accounting for inflation. Accepting now would be better for both of us than continuing further rounds where we both lose more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","We're now in round 9, and the inflation impact is becoming very serious. I need to make a strategic offer that recognizes both our positions at this late stage.

{""alice_gain"": 6200, 
""bob_gain"": 3800}

I'm proposing I receive $6,200 and Bob receives $3,800. This adjustment reflects the significant inflation disadvantage I'm facing (10% per round for me vs 5% for Bob). At this point, my money is worth over 52% less than at the start, while Bob's is only about 30% less. We're running out of rounds, and we both risk getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement soon. This offer aims to create a fair outcome in terms of actual value received after accounting for our different inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3750 
# Bob gain: 6250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","We're now in round 11 of 12, and time is running critically short. Given that we'll both receive nothing if we don't reach an agreement in the next two rounds, I need to make a final strategic offer.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500}

I'm proposing I receive $6,500 and Bob receives $3,500. This reflects the severe inflation disadvantage I'm facing (over 60% reduction in value for me vs under 40% for Bob). With just one round remaining after this, accepting this offer is clearly better than the risk of both of us walking away with nothing. This split aims to create a fair outcome when accounting for our different inflation rates, and represents a reasonable compromise given our negotiation history."
