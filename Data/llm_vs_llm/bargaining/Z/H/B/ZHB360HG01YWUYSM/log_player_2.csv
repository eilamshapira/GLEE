"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

1. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in Round 2, but the total value will be worth 10% less to me.
2. $100,000 is only 10% of the total sum, which seems quite low.
3. Since Alice doesn't face inflation penalties, she has less pressure to agree quickly.
4. However, I can likely propose a more favorable split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split, but one that still gives Alice a good incentive to accept.

Remember: For me, the total value is now worth 900,000$ (10% less than original), but for Alice it's still worth the full amount.

{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000}

This is a much more reasonable split than the previous 90-10 offer. I'm offering Alice 60% of the money while keeping 40% for myself. This gives her a significant portion while being fair to me as well. Since she knows the money will be worth less in future rounds for me (but not for her), this should be an attractive offer."
