"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Split it evenly, fair for both""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it. The value decreases with each round. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the decreasing value, I'll have to make a decision.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, the actual value I'd get from Bob's offer would be:
300000 * 0.9 = 270000

This is a relatively low offer, but I also need to consider the risk of further inflation in the next rounds.

My response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less now (10% less in Round 2 and another 10% less in Round 3), I'll try to make a more favorable offer to myself.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance for a reasonable split""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Let's end this before inflation eats away at your share any further. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value I'd get from Bob's offer would be:
350000 * 0.729 (1 - 0.271) = 255150

This is a relatively low offer, but I also need to consider the risk of further inflation in the next rounds, which could reduce my share even more.

Given that Bob's message implies this is his final offer, and the value of my potential share will continue to decrease, I'll have to make a decision.

My response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
