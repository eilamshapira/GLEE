"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me because I'm affected by 10% inflation each round while you aren't. If we drag this out, we both lose value. This is a fair deal considering our different situations.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I think your initial offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. I'm willing to meet you halfway and consider the inflation, but I also want a fair share. Let's compromise. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
