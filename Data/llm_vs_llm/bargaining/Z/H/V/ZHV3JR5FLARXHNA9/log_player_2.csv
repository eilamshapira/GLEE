"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a slightly higher share for me because I'm affected by 10% inflation each round while you aren't. If we drag this out, we both lose value. This is a fair deal considering our different situations. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
