"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I'll try to make a fair offer. Considering the initial amount is $10,000, after one round, it's worth $8,000 for me (20% less).

My offer:
{""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""alice_gain"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $2000 I would gain is actually worth $2000 * (1 - 0.36) = $2000 * 0.64 = $1280 in the initial round's value.

I'll accept this offer since it seems more reasonable given the inflation.
