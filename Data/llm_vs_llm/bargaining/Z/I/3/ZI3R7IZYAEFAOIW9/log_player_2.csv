"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $475,000 out of $1,000,000
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less to me in the next round
3. In the next round, the total value to me would be $900,000, and I would get to make the proposal
4. $475,000 is a fairly reasonable offer (47.5% of the total)
5. If I reject, I'd need to secure more than $527,778 ($475,000 รท 0.9) in the next round to be better off

Given that this is a decent first offer and the risk of inflation, I'll accept.
