"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to factor in the inflation for me, but I don't know how it affects Bob. I'll start with a relatively generous offer to increase the chances of acceptance, but still prioritizing my gain considering the potential inflation.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. My potential gain of $4500 is now worth 20% less than $4500 in round 1, meaning it's worth $4500 * 0.8 = $3600 in round 1 dollars.

While Bob's offer isn't great, it's still a decent amount, especially since I don't know Bob's inflation rate. Accepting now guarantees me $3600 (in round 1 dollars). Rejecting means I risk further inflation and potentially a worse offer from Bob next round. Since it's only round 2, I'll reject and try to get a better offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, it's my turn to make an offer again. My money is now worth 40% less than the initial value (20% less than round 2). I need to factor this into my offer. I'll try to get a slightly better deal for myself, but not so greedy that Bob rejects it outright.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
