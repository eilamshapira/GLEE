"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that money loses value faster for me (10%) than for Bob (5%) each round. This incentivizes reaching an agreement sooner rather than later.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I offer to take $550,000 and give Bob $450,000. This is a reasonable split that slightly favors me as the first mover, but still gives Bob a substantial portion. Given the time pressure and different inflation rates, accepting this offer would be beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob's offering a 50-50 split
2. Due to inflation:
   * My $500,000 is actually worth $450,000 (10% less)
   * Bob's $500,000 is worth $475,000 (5% less)
3. If I reject, I'll get another chance to make an offer, but:
   * The next round will have even more inflation
   * There's no guarantee Bob will accept my next offer
4. A fair split considering inflation differences would be slightly in my favor, but this offer is close enough

Given the inflation pressure and the risk of further devaluation, I'll accept this offer. While not ideal, it's a reasonable compromise.
