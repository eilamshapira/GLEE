"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 51.28, ""bob_gain"": 48.72, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I take $51.28 and you get $48.72.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  Given the inflation, accepting now is better for you than risking a smaller share in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 51.28, ""bob_gain"": 48.72, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand our earlier negotiations haven't worked out, but further delay means we both suffer more from inflation. In round 3, Iâ€™m proposing a fair split: I take $51.28 and you get $48.72. This division reflects our discounted values and is in line with the equilibrium division if we were to continue negotiating. Accepting now secures your share before even more value is lost. Looking forward to your agreement.""}"
