"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I take $51.28 and you get $48.72. Accepting now secures your share before the 5% discount kicks in next round, matching what you'd expect if negotiations continued. Looking forward to a fair deal! 
# Bob gain: 48.72 
# Alice gain: 51.28 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  Given the inflation, accepting now is better for you than risking a smaller share in later rounds.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand our earlier negotiations haven't worked out, but further delay means we both suffer more from inflation. In round 3, Iâ€™m proposing a fair split: I take $51.28 and you get $48.72. This division reflects our discounted values and is in line with the equilibrium division if we were to continue negotiating. Accepting now secures your share before even more value is lost. Looking forward to your agreement. 
# Bob gain: 48.72 
# Alice gain: 51.28 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Although it's the same offer as round 1, the value has decreased due to inflation. Accepting now locks in my share before it decreases further."
