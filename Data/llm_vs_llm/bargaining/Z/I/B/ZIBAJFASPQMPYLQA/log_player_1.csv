"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that accounts for the different inflation rates we face. Since my inflation rate (10%) is higher than Bob's (5%), I should aim for a favorable initial split while still being fair enough for Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose this 60-40 split to account for my higher inflation penalty. It's a reasonable first offer that gives Bob a substantial portion while protecting my interests given the higher inflation impact on my side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer is too low for me, especially considering my higher inflation rate. If I accept now, I'll only get $4000 at a 10% penalty, while Bob gets $6000 at just a 5% penalty. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round that better accounts for our different inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since we're now in round 3, my gains will be worth 20% less than the original value, and Bob's gains will be worth 15% less. I need to adjust my offer accordingly while still trying to reach an agreement before too many rounds pass.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a more balanced 55-45 split, which is more favorable to Bob than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still accounting for my higher inflation penalty. Given that we're both losing value with each round, this is a reasonable compromise."
