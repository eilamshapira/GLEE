"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer seems fair at a 50-50 split. However, I need to consider the inflation penalty. If I reject and proceed to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me. That means in the next round, the $100 would effectively be worth only $80 to me. Even if I proposed a more favorable split then, I'd be starting from a lower effective total.
