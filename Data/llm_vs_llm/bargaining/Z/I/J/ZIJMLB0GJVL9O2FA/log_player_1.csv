"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's my proposal for round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slightly favorable offer for myself, accounting for the fact that I'm facing inflation. I believe this is a reasonable starting point to encourage Bob to accept early, minimizing losses due to inflation for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation. If I accept this, I get $4500. In round 1, I proposed $5500. The current value of money is worth 10% less than in the first round. Let's calculate the equivalent value in round 1 money: 4500 / 0.9 = 5000. This is less than my initial proposal of 5500, but it's still a significant amount.

Given that further rounds will only decrease the value, and the risk of losing everything increases, I'll accept this offer.
