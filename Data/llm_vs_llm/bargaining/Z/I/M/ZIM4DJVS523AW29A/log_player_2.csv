"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40. This is a fair start considering the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I take $40 while she takes $60. If I reject this offer, I can make my own proposal next round, but I'll face 20% inflation, meaning the $100 would effectively be worth only $80 to me. 

Given the inflation pressure on my side, Alice's offer of $40 now might be better than trying to get more in a later round where the total value is diminished for me.
