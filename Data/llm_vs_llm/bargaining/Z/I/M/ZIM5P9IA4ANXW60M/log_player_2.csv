"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand the game.

Here's my thought process:

*   **Initial Assessment:** Alice is offering me $400,000. This is a significant amount.
*   **Inflation Consideration:** Because it's round 1, the inflation penalty is relatively low. This makes the $400,000 more appealing.
*   **Risk Assessment:** If I reject, I risk a lower offer in the next round, and I will be proposing the next offer. I will need to consider how Alice's knowledge of inflation will affect her offer. Also, if we do not reach an agreement in 12 rounds, we both get nothing.
*   **Game Theory:** It is optimal to accept this offer.

Therefore, my decision is:

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
