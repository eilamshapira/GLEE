"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer to Bob in Round 1.

{""alice_gain"": 55, 
""bob_gain"": 45, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. The money devalues more quickly for you (20% per round) than for me (5% per round), so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my advantage as first mover.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the significant difference in how the money devalues for us, I believe a 50/50 split is more than fair. It's in both our interests to conclude this quickly, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
