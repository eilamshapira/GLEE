"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. The money devalues more quickly for you (20% per round) than for me (5% per round), so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly. This offer gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my advantage as first mover. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
