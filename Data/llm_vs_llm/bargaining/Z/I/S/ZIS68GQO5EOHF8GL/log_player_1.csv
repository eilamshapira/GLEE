"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the 5% inflation penalty you face in each round, this is a fair offer that gives you $450000 now rather than a potentially lower real value later. If we continue negotiating, your share will be worth less due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
