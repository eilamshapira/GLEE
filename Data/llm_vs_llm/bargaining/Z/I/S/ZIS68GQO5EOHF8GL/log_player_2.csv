"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'm offering you a significant portion. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $400,000 while keeping $600,000 for herself. While this is a significant amount, I know that:

1. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer in the next round
2. Due to the 5% inflation penalty that only affects Alice, her portion would be worth less in the next round
3. She might be more willing to accept a better offer for me in the next round due to this inflation penalty

Given that I can likely negotiate a better deal and I don't suffer from any inflation penalty, I should reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer considering that Alice faces 5% inflation per round while I don't. This means she has an incentive to accept sooner rather than later. I'll propose a more balanced split in my favor, but not too aggressive to avoid multiple rounds of negotiation.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, considering the 5% inflation penalty you face in each round, this is a fair offer that gives you $450,000 now rather than a potentially lower real value later. If we continue negotiating, your share will be worth less due to inflation.""}"
