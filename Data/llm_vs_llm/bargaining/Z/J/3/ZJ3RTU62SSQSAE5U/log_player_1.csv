Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. If we continue negotiating, inflation will reduce the value for me, and we'll both end up with less overall. This is a balanced solution that maximizes our combined gain. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000
