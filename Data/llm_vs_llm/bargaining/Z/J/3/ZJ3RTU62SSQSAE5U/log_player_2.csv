"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing that I take $4,000 while she takes $6,000 of the $10,000.

If I reject this offer, the money will be worth 5% less for me in the next round, meaning the total value would effectively be $9,500 from my perspective. I would need to propose a better deal for myself in the next round and hope Alice accepts.

Given that this is only the first round and I believe I can negotiate a more equitable split, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more equitable while acknowledging the time pressure we both face.

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose an equal 50-50 split which is fair to both of us. If we continue negotiating, inflation will reduce the value for me, and we'll both end up with less overall. This is a balanced solution that maximizes our combined gain.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer considering the inflation effect.

Alice is offering me $4,500 while she takes $5,500. However, due to inflation, the $4,500 I would receive is actually worth only about $4,062 to me (after the 9.75% reduction from inflation).

If I reject and move to round 4, the inflation penalty will increase further, reducing the value of any money I receive even more. Also, Alice seems willing to negotiate and has moved from her initial 60-40 split toward a more equitable division.

Given the mounting inflation penalty and the improved offer, I'll accept this compromise.
