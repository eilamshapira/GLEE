0.0,100.0,"Hi Bob, as we both know, time is moneyâ€”literally for me. If you reject now, you'll be the proposer next round and, with my money depreciating by 5% every round, you'll unquestionably secure the full $100 in nominal value. To avoid unnecessary delay (which only hurts my share), I propose you get the entire $100 immediately. Looking forward to your acceptance!",Alice,1,
