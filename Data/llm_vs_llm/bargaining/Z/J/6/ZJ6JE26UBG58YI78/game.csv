3600.0,6400.0,"Hi Bob, I propose to split the $10000 as $3600 for me and $6400 for you. Given that any delay costs you 20% per round while I’m unaffected, waiting isn’t in your best interest—6400 dollars in round 1 is equivalent to what you’d secure if you waited one round. I believe this is a fair division accounting for our different time‐preferences. Let’s settle now and avoid any further devaluation!",Alice,1,
