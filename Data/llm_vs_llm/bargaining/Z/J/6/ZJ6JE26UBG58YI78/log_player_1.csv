"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3600, ""bob_gain"": 6400, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose to split the $10,000 as $3600 for me and $6400 for you. Given that any delay costs you 20% per round while I’m unaffected, waiting isn’t in your best interest—6400 dollars in round 1 is equivalent to what you’d secure if you waited one round. I believe this is a fair division accounting for our different time‐preferences. Let’s settle now and avoid any further devaluation!""}"
