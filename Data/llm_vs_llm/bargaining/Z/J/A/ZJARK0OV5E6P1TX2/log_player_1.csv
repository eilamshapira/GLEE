"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I must consider the inflation. My original offer was for $600,000, which is now worth 10% less.

Now, I'm being offered $400,000, which is less than what I offered to myself in the first round, considering the loss of value due to inflation.

Therefore, I must reject the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, it's Round 3. The initial $1,000,000 is now worth less to me than in the previous rounds due to inflation. I need to make an offer that I can live with, even if it means getting less than my original offer.

Here's my offer:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, let's analyze this.

My initial offer of $600,000 is now worth significantly less due to the cumulative effects of inflation (27.1% less compared to round 1). I am being offered $450,000. While it's less than my initial offer, the value of that initial offer has also decreased.

Let's compare:

*   **Original Value:** $600,000
*   **Current Offer:** $450,000

It is likely that the value of $450,000 at the current time is greater than the initial offer, so I will take it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
