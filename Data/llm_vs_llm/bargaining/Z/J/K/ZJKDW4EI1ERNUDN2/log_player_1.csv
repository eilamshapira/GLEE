Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

I'm trying to find a balance between maximizing my potential gain and making an offer that Bob might find reasonable enough to accept. Let's see if he goes for it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 6500

Bob is getting greedier, but holding out is still the best option.  The penalty for inflation is getting severe, but accepting a deal where he gets more than twice what I get would be a terrible outcome."

It's getting risky, but I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's the fairest deal and hopefully, Bob will see that accepting now is better than risking further inflation and potentially getting a worse offer later."
