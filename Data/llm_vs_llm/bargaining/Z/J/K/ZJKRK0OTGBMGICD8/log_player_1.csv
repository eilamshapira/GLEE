"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting this is a fair starting point. Your turn to respond as Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced outcome. Let's ensure a smoother agreement. 
# Alice gain: 505000 
# Bob gain: 495000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider the actual value of the offer.

The original amount I would have gotten is $505,000, but due to 20% inflation, its value to me is:
$505,000 * 0.8 = $404,000

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is relatively fair, and I don't want to risk further inflation reducing the value of my potential gain.

My response:
```
