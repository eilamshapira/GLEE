"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Since Alice's money loses 20% value each round, and mine doesn't depreciate, I have an advantage by rejecting and making a counter-offer. If Alice rejects my next offer, her $50 would only be worth $40 in round 3, while my share maintains its value.

Given this dynamic, I can likely negotiate a better deal for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that Alice's money depreciates by 20% each round, I can offer her a bit less than 50-50, since $40 now is worth more to her than $40 in the next round. However, I don't want to be too aggressive as she might reject and we need to reach an agreement within 12 rounds.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

Let me explain my reasoning to Alice: ""Since your money loses value each round, this $40 now is worth more than $40 in future rounds. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure."""
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice is offering me $55, which maintains its full value
2. She's taking $45, but due to 36% inflation for her, it's only worth about $28.80 to her
3. If I reject, we go to round 4, where:
   - I can make another offer
   - But her money will depreciate further (by 48%)
   - We're using up rounds (only 9 left)
   - She might reject again

The offer is actually quite good for me. I get more than half, and while I could potentially get more by rejecting, there's a risk of losing everything if we don't reach agreement within the remaining rounds.
