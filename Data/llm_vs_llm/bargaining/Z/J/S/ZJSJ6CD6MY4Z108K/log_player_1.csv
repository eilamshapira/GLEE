"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I believe an equal split is the fairest approach. We both walk away with $500000 each. This is better for me than your initial offer, and still excellent for you. Let's not lose more value to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I could aim for a higher share in the next round, Bob's offer is fair and guarantees a significant sum.  Continuing carries the risk of getting nothing if we fail to agree. Accepting a sure thing at this point is the most logical choice."
