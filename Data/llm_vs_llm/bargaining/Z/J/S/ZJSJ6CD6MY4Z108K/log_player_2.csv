"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this generous offer and we both win. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this offer carefully. Alice proposes I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000 of the $1,000,000. If I reject, we move to round 2 where I make an offer, but the total money decreases by 20% to $800,000.

While Alice's offer gives me a substantial amount, it's not an equal split. If I make a counter-offer in the next round, I could propose a more favorable division for myself from the $800,000 pot.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer while acknowledging the decreasing value.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I believe an equal split is the fairest approach. We both walk away with $500,000 each. This is better for me than your initial offer, and still excellent for you. Let's not lose more value to inflation.""}"
