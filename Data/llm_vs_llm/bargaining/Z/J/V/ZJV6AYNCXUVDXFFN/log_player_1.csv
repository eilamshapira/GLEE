"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for round 1, keeping in mind the potential for inflation and the limited number of rounds:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slight advantage for myself, but leaving a substantial amount for Bob. This offer aims to be fair enough for Bob to accept it immediately, avoiding any value loss from inflation. I believe this is a good balance between maximizing my potential gain and securing a deal early."
