"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that considers both our interests and the asymmetric inflation penalties. Since I lose 5% per round and Bob loses 20% per round, it's in Bob's interest to accept a reasonable first offer rather than wait.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This is a fair 60-40 split that gives Bob a substantial portion while recognizing that I have a stronger negotiating position due to the inflation rates. If Bob rejects this, his share will be worth significantly less in the next round due to his 20% penalty."
