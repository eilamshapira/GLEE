Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual value I'm considering is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000. However, for the proposal, I'll still use the original $10,000 amount.

To make a fair offer, I'll propose a 50/50 split of the original amount, considering the decreasing value for both of us.
