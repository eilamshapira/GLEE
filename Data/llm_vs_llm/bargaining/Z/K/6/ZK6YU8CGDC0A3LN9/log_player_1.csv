Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split it evenly at $50 each. Itâ€™s a fair proposal that avoids inflation loss. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
