"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make an offer that I think is fair, considering I'm playing as Alice and the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose a 60-40 split in our favor. This is slightly more than half for me since I'm facing inflation with each round, and I want to make sure we reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer as it gives me less than half of the total amount. Given the inflation factor, I need to be strategic, but I think we can find a more balanced solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll adjust my offer to try to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm proposing a more balanced split that still accounts for the inflation I'm facing. This is close to a 50-50 division with a slight advantage to me to offset some of the inflation effects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. With the inflation factor already reducing the value of my gain by 27.1%, and the risk of further rounds decreasing it more, this is a reasonable compromise close to 50-50."
