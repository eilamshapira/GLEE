Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is closer to a more ""fair"" split, I need to consider the impact of inflation. Accepting $48 now is worth considerably less than it was in Round 1. Alice is likely aware of the inflation affecting me and might be trying to push for a slightly advantageous deal."
