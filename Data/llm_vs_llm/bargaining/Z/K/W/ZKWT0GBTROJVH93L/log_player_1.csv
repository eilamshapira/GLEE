"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a reasonably fair offer, but slightly in my favor.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This gives both of us a substantial amount while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that this is a perfectly fair 50-50 split and we have limited rounds, I'll accept this offer. There's no guarantee that future negotiations would lead to a better outcome for me, and this is a fair division.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
