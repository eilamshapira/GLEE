"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual amount I'm dividing is $1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000. I'll make a fair offer.

{""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""alice_gain"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 36% less for me, and Alice offering me almost nothing, I'll have to reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the money is worth 36% less for me after the first two rounds (20% + 20% - (20% * 20%) = 36%) and another 20% less after this round, the actual amount I'm dividing is $1,000,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $640,000, but for simplicity, I will calculate the offer based on the original $1,000,000 and then consider the inflation.

However, taking into account the inflation, I should make an offer that is more favorable to myself to compensate for the loss of value.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 640000 
# Alice gain: 360000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the money is worth 59.04% less for me, the actual value I would get from Alice's offer is $640,000 * (1 - 0.5904) = $262,406.40.

However, since the alternative is to make another offer and risk further devaluation, I should consider accepting this offer.
