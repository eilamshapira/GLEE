"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me propose a reasonable first offer that gives both of us a good share while accounting for the risk of inflation if negotiations drag on.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose we split the money 60-40, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. This is a fair offer that gives Bob a significant portion while acknowledging that I'm making the first move in these negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:

1. If I accept Bob's offer now:
   * I get $4,500 at 95% value = $4,275 effective value
   * This is less than what I offered but still a significant amount

2. If I reject and make a new offer next round:
   * Any money will be worth another 5% less for me
   * I might end up in a back-and-forth negotiation losing more value
   * Bob might make an even less favorable offer

While this offer gives Bob more than me, the inflation penalty means I should probably take it now rather than risk further devaluation. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
