"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing to give me $4,000 out of the total $10,000, while keeping $6,000 for herself. 

If I reject this offer and the game goes to another round, I'll be able to make a counter-offer, but the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. That means the $10,000 pot would effectively be worth only $9,000 to me in the next round.

Given that I could potentially make a better offer in the next round despite the 10% inflation penalty, I'll reject this initial offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more balanced offer to Alice, taking into account that I've already lost 10% value due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}

My offer is to take $5,500 for myself while giving Alice $4,500. This is a fair division that gives me a slight advantage to compensate for the inflation I've already experienced, while still offering Alice a substantial amount that should be attractive enough to accept rather than moving to another round where she would face uncertainty."
