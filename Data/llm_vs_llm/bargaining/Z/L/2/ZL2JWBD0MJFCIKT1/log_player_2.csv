"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to account for the 10% inflation penalty I face each round.

If I reject now and make a counter-offer in the next round, the total value will be worth 9,000 to me (due to 10% inflation), but still 10,000 to Alice. This puts me at a disadvantage in future negotiations.

Given the inflation penalty only affects me, accepting a fair split now is better than risking further devaluation of my share.
