"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to factor in the inflation for my perspective.

*   **My perspective (Alice):** The money is now worth 5% less. My gain is effectively worth 6000 * (1 - 0.05) = 5700
*   **I will assume bob is facing with a 20% inflation rate.** The money is worth 20% less to bob. Bob's gain is effectively worth 4000 * (1 - 0.20) = 3200

Given the offer:

*   Alice gets $6000, but it's effectively worth $5700 to me.
*   Bob gets $4000.

I will accept this offer.
