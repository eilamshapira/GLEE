"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a division that takes into account that Bob's money loses 20% value each round, while mine doesn't. This gives me some negotiating leverage.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is fair considering Bob's money will depreciate if he refuses and we go to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Bob offers a 50-50 split
2. For me, $5000 is worth full value
3. For Bob, his $5000 is actually worth only $4000 (80% of original value) due to inflation
4. If I reject, we go to next round where Bob's money will be worth even less
5. This is actually a better deal for me than my initial offer, as Bob is taking the inflation hit
