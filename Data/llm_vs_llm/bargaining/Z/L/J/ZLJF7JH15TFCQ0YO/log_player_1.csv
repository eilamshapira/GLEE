"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, to kick off our negotiations I’d like to propose a split that I hope you find fair. Since for me every round brings a 5% devaluation of the money, settling early is in both our interests. I propose that I receive $4,500 and you receive $5,500. This recognizes that while I face inflation, you’re in a stronger position time‐wise. I look forward to your thoughts and hope we can reach an agreement promptly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better.  Given the inflation, I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. This recognizes the risk you take by waiting, but also provides a fair share for you. Let's work together to reach a solution quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
