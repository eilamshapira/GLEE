"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, to kick off our negotiations I’d like to propose a split that I hope you find fair. Since for me every round brings a 5% devaluation of the money, settling early is in both our interests. I propose that I receive $4500 and you receive $5500. This recognizes that while I face inflation, you’re in a stronger position time‐wise. I look forward to your thoughts and hope we can reach an agreement promptly. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better.  Given the inflation, I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. This recognizes the risk you take by waiting, but also provides a fair share for you. Let's work together to reach a solution quickly.""
