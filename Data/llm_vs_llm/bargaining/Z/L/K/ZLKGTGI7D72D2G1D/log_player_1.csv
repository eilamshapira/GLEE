"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to consider the inflation that affects me and the limited rounds. I'll start with a fair offer, slightly favoring myself to account for the inflation.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see. Bob is taking a larger cut and inflation is impacting him more than me. However, rejecting this risks further inflation and the possibility of getting nothing. I'll accept this offer.
