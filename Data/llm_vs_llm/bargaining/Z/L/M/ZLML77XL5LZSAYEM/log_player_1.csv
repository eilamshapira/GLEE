Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The money is losing value for me quickly. I need to secure a reasonable amount soon.
* **Bob's rejection:** Bob rejecting my initial offer suggests he might be aiming for a larger share, but his offer in round 2 was too low for me. 
* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise – less than my first but still a clear majority, and potentially more appealing to Bob than risking further inflation."
