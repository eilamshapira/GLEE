"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning: That's an extremely unfair split where Alice takes 90% of the money. Since I'll get to make the next offer and the 10% inflation isn't as bad as giving up 80% more than what I'm being offered, I'll reject this and make a counter-proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

Reasoning: I'll propose a fair 50-50 split. This is both equitable and more likely to be accepted than trying to be too greedy. While I could try to take advantage of the inflation pressure by offering Alice less, a fair split is more likely to end the game quickly, which is in both our interests due to the 10% inflation penalty per round. This offer gives each of us $500,000, which is significantly better than the $100,000 Alice offered me."
