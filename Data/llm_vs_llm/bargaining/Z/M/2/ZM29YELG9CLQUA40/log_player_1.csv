"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. Given the inflation affecting my share, this offer still gives you a significant portion while ensuring I get a fair amount considering the decreasing value of money. Let's settle this quickly to avoid further loss. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
