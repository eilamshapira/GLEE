"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split it 60/40. This is a fair offer considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money each round. We both get a good share, and avoid the risk of losing everything if we negotiate for too long. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
