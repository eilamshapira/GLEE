550000.0,450000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. With 10% inflation per round for me, taking less now would be financially unwise. This is a solid offer that gives you a substantial $450000 without risking inflation loss in future rounds.",Alice,1,

475000.0,525000.0,"Hi Alice, I rejected your initial offer because I think we can find a more mutually beneficial split. Given the inflation rate, I'm willing to take on a bit more risk to get a fairer share. Let's work together to find a deal that works for both of us.",Bob,2,

530000.0,470000.0,"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a more favorable split, but my inflation rate of 10% per round is higher than your 5%. This adjusted offer gives you more ($470K) while protecting me from greater inflation losses. Let's end this now - with your lower inflation rate, this is worth more to you than waiting, and I'm making a meaningful concession from my first offer.",Alice,3,
