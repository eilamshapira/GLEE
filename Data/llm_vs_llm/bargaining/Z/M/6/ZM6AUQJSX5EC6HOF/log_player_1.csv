"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. With 10% inflation per round for me, taking less now would be financially unwise. This is a solid offer that gives you a substantial $450,000 without risking inflation loss in future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I rejected your initial offer because I think we can find a more mutually beneficial split. Given the inflation rate, I'm willing to take on a bit more risk to get a fairer share. Let's work together to find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 530000, ""bob_gain"": 470000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a more favorable split, but my inflation rate of 10% per round is higher than your 5%. This adjusted offer gives you more ($470K) while protecting me from greater inflation losses. Let's end this now - with your lower inflation rate, this is worth more to you than waiting, and I'm making a meaningful concession from my first offer.""}"
