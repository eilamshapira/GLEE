"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a fair split that slightly favors me as the first mover. With 10% inflation per round for me, taking less now would be financially unwise. This is a solid offer that gives you a substantial $450000 without risking inflation loss in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since this is the first round, I'll consider the offer carefully. Given that I don't know the exact inflation effect on Alice, but I do know that the money will be worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I want to weigh my options.

Accepting the offer would give me $450,000 immediately, which is a significant amount. However, rejecting the offer and proceeding to the next round would allow me to make a counter-proposal and potentially get a better deal.

Considering the inflation rate of 5% per round for me, the total amount of $1,000,000 would be worth $950,000 after the first round, $902,500 after the second round, and so on. This means that the longer we wait, the less the total amount will be worth to me.

Given that Alice's initial offer gives me $450,000, which is 45% of the total amount, I think I can try to negotiate a better deal. Therefore, my response is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, it's now my turn to make a proposal. Considering the 5% inflation rate per round for me, I want to make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

I'll propose a split that gives me a slightly larger share than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 525000, 
""alice_gain"": 475000, 
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I rejected your initial offer because I think we can find a more mutually beneficial split. Given the inflation rate, I'm willing to take on a bit more risk to get a fairer share. Let's work together to find a deal that works for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a more favorable split, but my inflation rate of 10% per round is higher than your 5%. This adjusted offer gives you more ($470K) while protecting me from greater inflation losses. Let's end this now - with your lower inflation rate, this is worth more to you than waiting, and I'm making a meaningful concession from my first offer. 
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice rejected my offer, she's now made a counter-proposal. Given the updated information about the inflation rates, I'll reassess the situation.

The money I gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round, which means that the $1,000,000 is now worth approximately $902,500 to me (1 - 0.0975 = 0.9025). However, if I accept Alice's offer, I'll get $470,000, which is roughly 52% of the original amount.

On the other hand, Alice's offer gives her $530,000, which is approximately 53% of the original amount. Considering her 10% inflation rate per round, her share is worth 19% less than in the first round, which means she's taking on more risk by waiting.

Given that Alice has made a concession from her initial offer and considering the inflation rates, I think this offer is more reasonable. However, I still want to weigh my options carefully.

If I reject this offer and proceed to the next round, the money will be worth even less to me due to the 5% inflation rate. On the other hand, accepting this offer would give me a significant amount of money, albeit less than I initially proposed.

After careful consideration, I decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
