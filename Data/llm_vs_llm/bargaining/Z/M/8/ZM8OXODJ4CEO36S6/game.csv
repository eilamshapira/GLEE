5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Bob, I propose a fair 50-50 split of $10000 – you get $5000 and I get $5000. By settling now, we both avoid any future loss (especially for me, due to inflation). I believe a fair deal at the start is best for both of us. What do you say?",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your fair opening offer. However, since you mentioned you're affected by inflation and I'm not, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This way you can secure $4000 now rather than risk getting less value in later rounds due to inflation. This is still a reasonable split, and we can both walk away with a good outcome.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, I understand the inflation concern—as each round further reduces my share’s real value. Given that waiting might only worsen my position, I accept your 60-40 split proposal. Let's settle on $4000 for me and $6000 for you. Looking forward to a quick and fair closure to our negotiation!",Alice,2,accept
