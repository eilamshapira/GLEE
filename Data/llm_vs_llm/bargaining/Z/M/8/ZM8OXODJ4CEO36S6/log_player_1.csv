"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose a fair 50-50 split of $10,000 – you get $5,000 and I get $5,000. By settling now, we both avoid any future loss (especially for me, due to inflation). I believe a fair deal at the start is best for both of us. What do you say?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your fair opening offer. However, since you mentioned you're affected by inflation and I'm not, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This way you can secure $4000 now rather than risk getting less value in later rounds due to inflation. This is still a reasonable split, and we can both walk away with a good outcome. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand the inflation concern—as each round further reduces my share’s real value. Given that waiting might only worsen my position, I accept your 60-40 split proposal. Let's settle on $4000 for me and $6000 for you. Looking forward to a quick and fair closure to our negotiation!""}"
