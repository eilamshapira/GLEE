"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose a fair 50-50 split of $10000 â€“ you get $5000 and I get $5000. By settling now, we both avoid any future loss (especially for me, due to inflation). I believe a fair deal at the start is best for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is a fair 50-50 split
2. It's the first round, and I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer
3. Alice mentioned she's affected by inflation, which could give me leverage in later rounds
4. However, there's always the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds
5. $5000 is a significant amount

While I could try to negotiate for more, this is a reasonable opening offer. However, since I know I'm not affected by inflation and Alice is, I might be able to get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a strategic offer that's slightly in my favor, but still reasonable enough that Alice might accept to avoid inflation effects:

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your fair opening offer. However, since you mentioned you're affected by inflation and I'm not, I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This way you can secure $4000 now rather than risk getting less value in later rounds due to inflation. This is still a reasonable split, and we can both walk away with a good outcome.""}"
