"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me after the first round, the actual value I'm considering is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000. However, the nominal amount remains $10,000. I'll make an offer that is slightly more favorable to Alice than a 50/50 split would be after accounting for the value reduction.

{""bob_gain"": 3800, 
""alice_gain"": 6200}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would gain is $10,000 * 0.64 = $6,400 (since it's worth 36% less). For Alice, it's $10,000 * 0.81 = $8,100 (since it's worth 19% less).

Given Alice's offer:
- My gain: $4,200 (but worth $4,200 * 0.64 = $2,688 to me due to inflation)
- Alice's gain: $5,800 (but worth $5,800 * 0.81 = $4,698 to her due to inflation)

I'll consider the offer based on the inflated values.
