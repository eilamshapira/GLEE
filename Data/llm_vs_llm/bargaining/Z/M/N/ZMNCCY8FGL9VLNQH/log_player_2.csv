"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, which seems fair at first glance. However, I need to account for the inflation effect.

If I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth 20% less to me. That means in the next round, the $1,000,000 would only be worth $800,000 from my perspective. Even if I managed to get all of it (which is unlikely since Alice would need to accept), I'd still only get the equivalent of $800,000 in current value.

Given that Alice is offering me $500,000 now, which is better than any realistic amount I could get in future rounds after accounting for inflation, I should accept this offer.
