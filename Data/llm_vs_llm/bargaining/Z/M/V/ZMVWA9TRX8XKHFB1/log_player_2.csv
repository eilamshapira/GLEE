"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's proposing I get $4,000 while she gets $6,000 of the $10,000 total.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money will be worth 5% less to me, meaning the $10,000 would effectively be worth $9,500 to me. For Alice, it would be worth 10% less, or $9,000.

Given that I could propose a more favorable split in the next round, and considering Alice would face a larger depreciation than I would if she rejects my counter-offer, I believe I can achieve a better outcome by continuing.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that accounts for the changed values due to inflation while being fair enough that Alice would likely accept.

Since we're now in round 2, the $10,000 is worth 5% less to me (equivalent to $9,500) and 10% less to Alice (equivalent to $9,000). If Alice rejects my offer, we'll go to round 3 where the money will be worth even less to both of us, especially to her.

I'll propose a more balanced split that gives Alice incentive to accept rather than facing another round of depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering a fair 50/50 split of the money. This gives Alice $5,000 which is better than risking further depreciation in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer carefully.

Alice is now offering me $4,500 out of the $10,000, which is better than her initial offer of $4,000.

Due to inflation, the total $10,000 is now worth 9.75% less to me, meaning the $10,000 is effectively worth about $9,025 from my perspective. The $4,500 Alice is offering would be worth about $4,061.25 in round 1 terms.

If I reject and move to round 4, the money will depreciate further - another 5% for me and another 10% for Alice. This means the money would be worth about 14.75% less to me and 29% less to Alice compared to round 1.

Given that:
1. Alice has improved her offer
2. The money is depreciating faster for Alice than for me
3. Alice still has more incentive to reach an agreement

However, $4,500 is still less than half, and I believe I could get a better deal in the next round given Alice's steeper depreciation rate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since we're now in round 4, I need to consider that the money has depreciated further. For me, it's worth about 14.75% less than in round 1, and for Alice, it's worth about 29% less than in round 1.

If Alice rejects my offer, we'll move to round 5, where the depreciation will be even greater - especially for her. This gives me some leverage, but I also need to make an offer that's attractive enough for Alice to accept.

Given the depreciation rates and our negotiation history, I'll make an offer that's favorable to me while still giving Alice enough incentive to accept rather than face another round of significant depreciation.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering Alice $4,500, which is the same amount she offered me in the previous round. This is a reasonable offer considering the asymmetric depreciation rates. For Alice, accepting $4,500 now is better than risking further depreciation in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer in light of the inflation effects.

Alice is now offering me $5,000 out of the $10,000, which is an even 50/50 split.

Due to inflation, the total $10,000 is now worth 18.55% less to me, meaning my $5,000 share would effectively be worth about $4,073 in round 1 terms.

If I reject and move to round 6, the money will depreciate further - another 5% for me (bringing total depreciation to about 23.55%) and another 10% for Alice (bringing her total depreciation to about 44.39%).

Considering that:
1. Alice has improved her offer significantly to an even split
2. The money continues to depreciate faster for Alice than for me
3. My $5,000 now is worth more than what I might get after another round of depreciation
4. We've reached a fair 50/50 split which is generally considered equitable

This seems like a reasonable point to accept the offer.
