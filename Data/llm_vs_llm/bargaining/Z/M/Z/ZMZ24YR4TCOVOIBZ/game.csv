3448.28,6551.72,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I receive $3448.28 and you receive $6551.72. This division reflects our different rates of time‚Äêsensitivity (my funds lose 10% in value each round while yours only lose 5%). Accepting now spares us both further erosion, so I believe this is a fair and efficient split.",Alice,1,
