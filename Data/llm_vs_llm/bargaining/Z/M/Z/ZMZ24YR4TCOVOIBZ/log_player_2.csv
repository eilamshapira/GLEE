"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I receive $3448.28 and you receive $6551.72. This division reflects our different rates of time‚Äêsensitivity (my funds lose 10% in value each round while yours only lose 5%). Accepting now spares us both further erosion, so I believe this is a fair and efficient split. 
# Bob gain: 6551.72 
# Alice gain: 3448.28 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
