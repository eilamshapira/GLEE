"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I must consider the inflation. My initial offer was for $900,000. Now, with 20% inflation, the original $1,000,000 is now effectively worth $800,000 to me. Bob's offer gives me $400,000.

Since I now value the money less, I have to be more careful. $400,000 is still a substantial amount.

Therefore, I will **accept** the offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
