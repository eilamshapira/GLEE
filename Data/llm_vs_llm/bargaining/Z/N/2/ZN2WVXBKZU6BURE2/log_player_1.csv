Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":7000,""bob_gain"":3000,""message"":""Let's start with a fair division. I believe this is a good basis for our negotiation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both walk away with an equal share, and we can avoid losing value to inflation in further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
