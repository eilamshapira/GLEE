"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I believe this is a good basis for our negotiation! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer significantly favors Alice with a 70-30 split. Given that I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer and we're only in round 1, I'll reject this uneven distribution. However, I need to keep in mind that with each round, my potential gains decrease by 10% due to inflation, so I shouldn't drag this out too long."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This way we both walk away with an equal share, and we can avoid losing value to inflation in further rounds.""}

The equal split is the most rational first offer from my side. It's fair, reasonable, and gives us both a good outcome. Since I know I'm affected by 10% inflation per round, I want to encourage a quick resolution, but I also don't want to appear too desperate which might be exploited in future rounds."
