"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, 
""bob_gain"": 50, 
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but let's still keep it fair and finish this round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 10% inflation, the actual values would be:
Alice gain: 45 * 0.9 = 40.5
Bob gain: 55 * 0.9 = 49.5

I don't think this is a fair split, and I'd like to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Due to the 10% inflation in each round, the money is now worth 19% less than the original value (10% in Round 1 + 10% in Round 2, so 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 52, 
""bob_gain"": 48, 
""message"": ""Let's settle this before we lose more value, I'm being generous considering the inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's end this round, before we lose all of the money! 
# Alice gain: 46 
# Bob gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 10% inflation in each of the previous 3 rounds, the actual values would be:
Alice gain: 46 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 46 * 0.729 = 33.5
Bob gain: 54 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 54 * 0.729 = 39.4

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I also don't want to risk losing even more value due to inflation.
