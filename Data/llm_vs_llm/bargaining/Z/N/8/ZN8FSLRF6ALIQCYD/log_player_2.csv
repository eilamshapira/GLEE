"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split it 60/40. A fair deal to start! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

With a 60/40 split, I (Bob) would get $40. If I reject and move to the next round:
- The money will be worth 20% less due to inflation
- The maximum I could propose would be worth $80 (in deflated value)
- Alice might reject my proposal, leading to further rounds and more inflation

While 40/60 isn't an even split, it's a reasonable first offer. If I reject, I risk getting less value in future rounds due to inflation, and there's no guarantee Alice would accept a better offer from me.
