"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the inflation affecting me. In the first round, the inflation effect isn't too bad, so I'll start with a generous offer to try and secure a deal quickly.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer isn't great. I need to calculate the impact of inflation on my potential gains if I reject this offer. Since it's only round 2, I'll calculate the approximate value of the 3000$ he's offering versus what I think I can get later, adjusted for the 5% inflation. Even though the total money is still 10,000$, the longer we wait, the less each dollar is worth *to me*.

I'll reject this offer. I think I can get a better deal.

```json

""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Alright, round 3. Inflation is starting to become more of a factor for me. I need to make a more enticing offer to Bob, while still getting a decent amount. I'll try to find a middle ground, slightly favoring Bob, to hopefully get him to accept. I need to consider that Bob may be rational and understand that the game will end soon, so my offers should be more generous towards him.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2800 
# Bob gain: 7200 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, Bob's offer is getting worse from my perspective, and my inflation is increasing quickly. 2800 is not a good offer given that my money is worth 14.26% less than round 1. It seems Bob is trying to push me to the limit, perhaps assuming my inflation rate is very high. However, rejecting now risks further inflation and potentially a worse offer next round.

I'm going to reject this, hoping that I can get him to accept a more reasonable offer next round.

""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, Round 5. Inflation is really starting to bite now. I need to be more realistic about what I can get. I need to make Bob a better offer, but I also need to secure a decent amount for myself before the money becomes practically worthless to me. I will make a more generous offer and pray that Bob accepts.

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""bob_gain"": 5100
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3200 
# Bob gain: 6800 
Do you accept this offer?","Alright, Round 6. Bob's offer of 3200 isn't terrible, but with inflation at 22.62%, it's significantly less appealing than it looks on the surface. It appears that Bob is not suffering from the same inflation as I am, or he would be more willing to negotiate.

I will accept Bob's offer.
