"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly considering the inflation risk. This offer gives you a substantial amount while ensuring we both get a good deal early on. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Current offer: $4,500 for me, $5,500 for Alice
2. If I reject, the next round will have 5% inflation, meaning the $10,000 total will be worth $9,500 to me
3. While the split isn't perfectly equal (45/55), getting a guaranteed $4,500 now is better than risking:
   - Further value loss due to inflation
   - Potentially worse counter-offers
   - Risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds

Given that this is a reasonable first offer and the inflation risk is significant, I'll accept.
