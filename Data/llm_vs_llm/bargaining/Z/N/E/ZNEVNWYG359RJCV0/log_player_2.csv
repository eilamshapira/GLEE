"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 
Alice has offered me $40, keeping $60 for herself. While this isn't an equal split, it's a reasonable starting offer considering:

1. I'm not losing value to inflation in future rounds
2. $40 is a significant portion of the total
3. If I reject, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in future negotiations
4. We have a limited number of rounds, and failing to reach an agreement means we both get nothing

However, since I have the opportunity to counter-offer in the next round and I'm not affected by inflation, I believe I can negotiate for a slightly better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but still considering the negotiation dynamics. I'll aim for a fair division while still being reasonable:

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

This is a perfectly equal split which should be hard to argue against from a fairness perspective. It improves my position from the previous offer while still being reasonable and cooperative rather than greedy. Since I'm not affected by inflation, I can afford to negotiate patiently, but I also want to show good faith with a fair offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has increased her offer to me from $40 to $45
2. I'm not affected by inflation
3. Alice is now affected by 19% inflation, meaning her $55 is actually worth less to her than before
4. We've used 3 of our 12 rounds
5. The offer is getting closer to an equal split

Since Alice is now experiencing inflation and has improved her offer to me, this shows she's willing to negotiate. However, given that I'm not affected by inflation and the split is still in her favor, I think I can still negotiate for a slightly better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given the situation:
1. Alice is experiencing inflation (19% currently)
2. I'm not affected by inflation
3. Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by increasing her previous offer
4. We need to reach agreement within 12 rounds
5. Alice rejected the 50-50 split earlier

I'll propose a split that's slightly more favorable to me but still reasonable:

{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48}

This offer gives me a small advantage while still being close to equal. Since Alice is affected by inflation, she might be more willing to accept a slightly less favorable deal now rather than risk further devaluation of her share."
