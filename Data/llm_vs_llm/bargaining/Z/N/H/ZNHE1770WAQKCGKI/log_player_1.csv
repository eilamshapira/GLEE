"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering I'm making the first move and taking initiative.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the 20% inflation after the first round, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable, as the money is now worth less. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The reasoning behind accepting:
1. Due to 20% inflation, the real value of my $45 now is equivalent to $36 from round 1
2. If I reject, we go to round 3 where inflation will reduce value by another 20%
3. Bob's offer is reasonable given the circumstances
4. Further negotiation would likely result in both of us getting less real value due to inflation"
