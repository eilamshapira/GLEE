45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, since you face 20% inflation per round, the $60 you asked for would only be worth $48 to you this round. I'm offering you $45 now, which is actually better for you in real value than waiting another round. This is a fair split considering the inflation factor, and we both walk away with meaningful amounts.",Bob,2,
