Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,""bob_gain"": 40,""message"": ""Let's start off with a fair split. I get 60$, you get 40$. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, since you face 20% inflation per round, the $60 you asked for would only be worth $48 to you this round. I'm offering you $45 now, which is actually better for you in real value than waiting another round. This is a fair split considering the inflation factor, and we both walk away with meaningful amounts. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
