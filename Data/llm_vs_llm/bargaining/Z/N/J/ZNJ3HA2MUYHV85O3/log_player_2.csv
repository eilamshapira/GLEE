"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start off with a fair split. I get 60$, you get 40$. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She proposes a 60-40 split in her favor, giving me $40.

Looking at the inflation conditions, I notice that with each passing round, the money doesn't lose value for me (0% inflation), but it loses 20% value for Alice. This means that if we go to another round, Alice will value the total amount less, which gives me negotiating leverage.

Since I don't face any inflation penalty for waiting, and Alice will value the total pot at only 80% in the next round, I can likely get a better deal by rejecting this offer and making my own proposal next round.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counter-offer that takes into account the inflation Alice faces.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, since you face 20% inflation per round, the $60 you asked for would only be worth $48 to you this round. I'm offering you $45 now, which is actually better for you in real value than waiting another round. This is a fair split considering the inflation factor, and we both walk away with meaningful amounts.""}"
