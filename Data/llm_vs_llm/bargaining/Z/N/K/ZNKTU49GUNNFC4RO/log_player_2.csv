"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. This gives us both a good share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's split things a bit more evenly. This seems fair.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a more even split, but I need a bit more to account for the decreasing value. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While not ideal, accepting this offer ensures I get something before inflation eats further into the potential gains. Delaying further is riskier for me than for Alice."
