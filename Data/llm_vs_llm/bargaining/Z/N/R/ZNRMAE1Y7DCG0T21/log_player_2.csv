"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer: we each get $5,000, which is a 50-50 split of the total $10,000. This is a fair and equal division.

Since there's no inflation for me (the money is worth 0% less for me with each passing round), there's no financial advantage for me to reject and make a counter-offer. The even split is equitable, and accepting now guarantees that outcome.
