"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to factor in the inflation for both myself and Bob when making my offer. Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

My reasoning: I'm starting with a slightly favorable offer for myself, considering I'm making the first proposal. Hopefully, Bob will find this acceptable given the decreasing value of the money with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I need to consider the inflation before making my decision.

*   **My gain if I accept:** $55, but worth 10% less than in Round 1. So, effectively worth $55 * 0.9 = $49.50 in Round 1 value.
*   **Potential gain if I reject:** I would then make an offer in Round 3, where my money will be worth 20% less than in Round 1.

Given that $49.50 is a reasonable amount considering the inflation, and that rejecting means further devaluation of any potential gain in Round 3, I will accept the offer.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
