"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the rules. I want to make a fair and strategic offer, keeping in mind the inflation and the limited rounds. I will start with a slightly advantageous offer for myself, anticipating Bob might negotiate.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. Bob's offer mirrors my initial offer, just with the amounts reversed. Given the inflation and the dwindling number of rounds, rejecting this would be risky. Even though I'd prefer more, accepting this secures $4000, which is better than potentially nothing later.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
