"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I'll try to make a fair offer. Considering the initial amount is $10,000, after one round, it's worth $8,000 for me (20% less).

My offer:
{""bob_gain"": 4500, 
""alice_gain"": 5500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $4200 I would gain is actually worth $6720 in the initial round (since it's 36% less, or 0.64 of the initial value: 4200 / 0.64 = 6562.5, approximately), and the $5800 Alice would gain is not my concern.

However, I must think about the potential next round. If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less for me.
