"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a middle ground, I think this is a fairer split. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Time is money, Bob, and it's disappearing quickly. This offer is a compromise, meeting you closer to the middle ground.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **The pressure is on:** The value of the money is decreasing for me with each round.  I need to push for a resolution soon.
* **Show flexibility, but hold firm:** I'm willing to move closer to an even split, but I still hold the advantage in this round. Bob's offer last round suggests he might be willing to settle for a bit less than half. 
* **Strategic message:** By mentioning ""time is money,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the inflation factor, even though he hasn't explicitly acknowledged it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation is affecting you, I think this is a reasonable adjustment to my previous offer. 
# Alice gain: 425000 
# Bob gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to use the inflation against me. While he acknowledges its impact, his ""adjusted"" offer is still heavily skewed in his favor, especially considering the shrinking value of the money for me. It's a waiting game now, and I need to be prepared to make a tough decision soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This offer is a compromise considering the circumstances. Accepting now prevents further losses for both of us.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and firm:**  It's time to be more assertive. Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation, and I need to make my position clear. 
* **Acknowledging the reality:** I'm still offering a split where Bob gets a significant amount, and I'm highlighting that a deal now benefits both of us by preventing further losses from inflation.
* **Strategic concession:** I am conceding slightly from my previous offer to signal a willingness to negotiate, but not by much.  I need to balance getting a decent deal against the risk of the money losing even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant impact of inflation on your gains, I believe this offer is more than fair at this point. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It pains me to accept this offer, but it's the most logical choice in this situation. 

* **The clock is ticking:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me. If I reject this and enter another round, the deal I'll likely have to accept will be even worse.
* **Bob is unlikely to budge:** He's clearly dug in and is using the inflation to his advantage. It's doubtful he will offer anything significantly better.

While not ideal, accepting this offer guarantees me a reasonable sum, even with the inflation taken into account. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but waiting any longer will only hurt me more."
