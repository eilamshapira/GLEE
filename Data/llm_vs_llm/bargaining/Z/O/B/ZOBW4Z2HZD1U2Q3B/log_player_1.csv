"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us, and we should agree quickly to avoid losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's offer is now worth 5% less to him, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer is worth 5% less to him in each round, and this is the third round, his share will be worth approximately 10% less than the original value (5% less in Round 2 and another 5% less in Round 3, but calculated from the 95% remaining, so 5% of 95% is 4.75%, and 5% + 4.75% = 9.75% less). 

Considering this, I'll make an offer that's slightly in my favor:

{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Inflation is eating into your share, let's settle before it's too late""}"
