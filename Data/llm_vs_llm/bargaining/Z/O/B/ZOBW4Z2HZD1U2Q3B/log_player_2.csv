"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me 4000$ while taking 6000$ for herself. This is not an equal split, and since I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer in the next round, I might get a better deal.

However, I need to consider that in the next round, my share will be worth 5% less due to inflation. So if I reject this offer, my future gains will be decreased by that amount.

4000$ now is better than a potentially higher nominal amount that's worth less due to inflation. Additionally, we have a limited number of rounds, and prolonging the negotiation could lead to both of us getting nothing.

Still, I believe I can get a fairer split by making a counter-offer in the next round, even accounting for the 5% inflation.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more equitable split while acknowledging that we should try to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation affecting my gains.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split. This is equitable for both of us, and we should agree quickly to avoid losses from inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is eating into your share, let's settle before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has actually decreased her initial offer (from 4000$ to 3500$)
2. The inflation penalty is increasing (9.75% now)
3. My real value from this offer would be: 3500$ * (1 - 0.0975) = 3158.75$

This offer is worse than her first offer, and she seems to be using the inflation pressure against me. However, if I reject:
- Next round will have 14.75% inflation for me
- We're using up rounds (9 left)
- Alice might continue to decrease offers

Even though this offer is unfavorable, the inflation penalty is becoming significant, and Alice seems to be playing hardball. It might be better to accept now than risk getting even less in future rounds.
