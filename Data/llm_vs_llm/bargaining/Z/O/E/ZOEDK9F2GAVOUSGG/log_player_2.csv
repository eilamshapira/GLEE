"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer.

Alice proposes an even split of the $10,000, with each of us getting $5,000.

This is a fair 50-50 split. If I reject and we go to another round, the total amount will be worth 10% less ($9,000), and while I could propose a more favorable split for myself, there's no guarantee Alice would accept. 

Considering this is a fair offer with no devaluation, I'll accept.
