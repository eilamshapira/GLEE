"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by proposing a fair division that takes into account the inflation effect I'm facing.

I'm offering you $450,000 while I take $550,000. I'm proposing a slightly higher amount for myself because I face 10% inflation each round, so I need to account for that risk. This is a fair first offer that gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging my disadvantage in later rounds."
