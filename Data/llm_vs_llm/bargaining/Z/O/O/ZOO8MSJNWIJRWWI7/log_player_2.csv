"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid inflation losses! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. This is a fair 50-50 split
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 5% less next round
3. Even if I make a more favorable proposal next round, Alice might reject it
4. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush

The even split is a reasonable offer, and avoiding inflation makes sense. There's no guarantee I can get a better deal later, and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky.
