"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I understand. I'll analyze Bob's offer, considering the 10% inflation from round 1.

*   **Alice's gain (nominal):** $4500
*   **Bob's gain (nominal):** $5500
*   **Effective value (10% less than round 1):** My share is worth less than it was in round 1.

Considering the decreasing value of the money and the limited rounds, I have to make a decision.

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
