"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this... 

Alice is offering a 50-50 split, which appears fair at first glance. However, with inflation reducing the value by 10% each round, if I reject now:
- In round 2, $500K would only be worth $450K to me
- I could propose a better split for myself
- But Alice might reject, leading to further value loss

Given that:
1. This is a decent offer
2. There's risk in rejection due to inflation
3. It's better to secure a good deal early
