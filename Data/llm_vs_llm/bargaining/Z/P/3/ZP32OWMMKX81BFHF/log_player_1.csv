"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Let me think strategically. Since Bob faces 10% depreciation each round while I don't, he has more incentive to accept early. I'll start with a somewhat favorable split for me, but not too aggressive.

""alice_gain"": 600000,

""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split. Given that waiting costs you 10% per round, this is a fair offer that gives us both a substantial amount.""
