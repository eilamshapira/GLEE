500000.0,500000.0,"I propose an equal 50-50 split which gives us both $500000. This is fair and balanced, allowing us both to walk away with a significant amount. Given that I face 10% inflation with each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon rather than letting the total value diminish through extended negotiations.",Bob,2,
