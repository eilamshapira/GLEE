"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":900000,""bob_gain"":100000,""message"":""I propose that I take 90% of the money and you take 10%. This gives us a clear division.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal 50-50 split which gives us both $500000. This is fair and balanced, allowing us both to walk away with a significant amount. Given that I face 10% inflation with each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon rather than letting the total value diminish through extended negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
