"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose that I take 90% of the money and you take 10%. This gives us a clear division. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is proposing I receive only 10% ($100,000) while she takes 90% ($900,000). This is quite unbalanced in her favor.

Given the 10% inflation penalty per round for me, I should calculate if waiting would be advantageous. If I reject now and propose a better split next round, my maximum potential gain would be decreased by 10% due to inflation.

This first offer is very low, and I believe I can propose a much more equitable split in the next round, even accounting for the inflation penalty.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced offer that recognizes both our interests, while acknowledging the inflation factor that affects me.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""I propose an equal 50-50 split which gives us both $500,000. This is fair and balanced, allowing us both to walk away with a significant amount. Given that I face 10% inflation with each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon rather than letting the total value diminish through extended negotiations.""}"
