"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's offer of a 60-40 split where I would get $4,000 and she would get $6,000.

Since there's no inflation for me (the money is worth 0% less each round), there's no penalty for me to continue to the next round where I can make a counter-offer. If I reject, I'll have the opportunity to propose a division that might be more favorable to me.

Given that I don't know how inflation affects Alice, it's possible she might be more willing to accept a different offer in the next round if inflation affects her negatively.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer since we both need to agree.

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a fair 50-50 split that gives us both an equal share of the money. This is the most equitable division.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of my first offer and your 50-50 split 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider Alice's new offer where I would get $4,200 and she would get $5,800.

Alice has moved slightly from her initial 60-40 split toward my 50-50 proposal. She's now offering me an additional $200 compared to her first offer. I also note that inflation is affecting Alice's gains (19% less value than in the first round), but not affecting my gains.

Since there's no inflation penalty for me to continue negotiating, and I could potentially get a better deal in the next round, especially considering that Alice is facing increasing inflation pressure...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving toward a more balanced split. I'm also meeting you partway - this is closer to an even division while still giving you the larger share. Given the inflation affecting your gains, we should reach an agreement soon.""
}
