Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

I'm trying to find a balance between maximizing my potential gain and securing a deal.  With each round, the value decreases, so I need to be mindful of that while also trying to get a slightly better offer than Bob's."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking further inflation and a potentially worse offer from Bob in the next round."
