Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose we split the money equally. A fair 50-50 division keeps things simple and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing if we drag this out. Let's agree now and ensure we both walk away with a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
