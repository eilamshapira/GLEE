"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this offer. I would get $200,000 in the first round. If I reject it, the money is worth 5% less to me in the next round. So, in the next round, the $200,000 I'm being offered would be equivalent to 200,000 / 0.95 = $210,526.32 *today's* dollars. 

However, Alice will then make a proposal, and I can't guarantee that she'll offer me more than $200,000 *after* her 20% loss. If she only offers slightly more, it could be worse for me than accepting $200,000 now.

Given the high inflation for Alice, she might be willing to give me more later, but there is no guarantee. It is best to accept the first offer.
