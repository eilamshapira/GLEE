"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because it's still favorable for me even with the 5% depreciation, and it gives Alice a substantial portion that she might find acceptable rather than risking further rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 95 
# Alice gain: 5 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The offer gives me $95, which after the 9.75% inflation is worth approximately $85.74. This is a very good offer for me, much better than risking another round where the money would be worth even less due to inflation. I'll accept this offer."
