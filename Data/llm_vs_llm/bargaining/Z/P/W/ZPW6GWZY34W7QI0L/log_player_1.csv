"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a proposal for dividing the $1,000,000 between Bob and myself.

Given that I (Alice) face a 10% depreciation per round while Bob faces no depreciation, it's in my interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. However, I also need to make a fair offer that Bob is likely to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. This is a reasonable 60-40 split that acknowledges my disadvantage in future rounds due to the depreciation factor, while still giving Bob a substantial portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I need to consider the situation carefully. Since we're now in round 3, any money I receive will be worth 20% less to me than in round 1. Bob doesn't face this disadvantage, so delays favor him. However, I still need to make a reasonable offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a more balanced 55-45 split that gives Bob a better deal than my initial offer while still acknowledging my time disadvantage. This compromise should be more appealing to Bob while still being acceptable to me despite the depreciation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","We're now in round 5, which means any money I receive will be worth about 34.4% less than in round 1 due to compounding inflation. Bob continues to face no depreciation, so his position strengthens with each passing round. I need to make a realistic offer that acknowledges this changing dynamic.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split where I get $500,000 and Bob gets $500,000. This is a fair and balanced division that should appeal to Bob's sense of fairness while still being acceptable to me despite the significant depreciation I face. A 50-50 split is often seen as the default fair division, and I hope Bob will recognize this and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
