"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that I receive $10 and you receive $90. If you wait until later rounds, your share will drop by 10% each round due to inflation. Accept now and secure the full value of $90. 
# Bob gain: 90 
# Alice gain: 10 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $90, which is a very generous split (90/10)
2. She's correct that if I reject, my future gains will be worth less due to 10% inflation each round
3. This is the first round, so I'll get the full value of $90
4. Even if I tried to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty would likely result in less real value

Since this is a very favorable offer and the inflation penalty makes waiting risky, I should accept.
