"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I need to evaluate the offer carefully.

In Round 1, my offer was to receive $600,000. Now, due to 5% inflation, the equivalent value is: $600,000 * (1 - 0.05) = $570,000.

Bob's offer:
*   Alice gain: 400000 
*   Bob gain: 600000

I am offered $400,000 in this round. This is less than my previous offer and less than the value I placed on the money in the first round.

Therefore, I will reject the offer.
