"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Let me think strategically. Since Bob faces a 20% depreciation each round while I don't, he has an incentive to accept earlier rather than later. I'll start with a somewhat favorable split for me, but not too extreme.

""alice_gain"": 600000,

""message"": ""Hi Bob! Since the money loses 20% value for you each round but not for me, it's in your best interest to accept early. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""
