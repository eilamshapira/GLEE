"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Since the money loses 20% value for you each round but not for me, it's in your best interest to accept early. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is correct that the money loses 20% value for me each round
2. If I reject, in the next round my $400K would be worth $320K (80% of value)
3. If I counter-offer for more, Alice might reject, leading to further devaluation
4. $400K immediately is better than a risky attempt to get more
5. The 40/60 split acknowledges my weaker negotiating position due to inflation

While I could try for more, the risk of losing value through inflation makes this a reasonable offer.
