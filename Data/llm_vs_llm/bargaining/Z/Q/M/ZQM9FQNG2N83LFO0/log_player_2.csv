Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

Message: ""I propose a fair split that favors me slightly to account for the time value loss I'm experiencing due to inflation. This way we both get a substantial amount."""
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
1. Due to 36% inflation, $40 is now worth only $25.60 to me
2. If I reject and we go to next round, inflation will increase to 48.8% 
3. Making any further negotiations even less favorable for me
4. $25.60 is still better than risking further devaluation
