"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair offer for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","This doesn't seem like a fair division at all. Alice is proposing to take 95% of the money while giving me only 5%. Since the money doesn't lose value for me between rounds, and Alice faces a 5% inflation penalty, I should reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more balanced offer that accounts for the inflation factor.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, 
""alice_gain"": 500000, 
""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a 50-50 split which is truly fair. If you reject this, in the next round your share will be worth 5% less due to inflation, while my money keeps its value. A 50-50 split now maximizes our combined value.""}"
