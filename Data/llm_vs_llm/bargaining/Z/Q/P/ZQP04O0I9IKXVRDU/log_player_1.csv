"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Let me think strategically about this offer. In this game, as Alice, I need to propose a division that Bob will find acceptable, considering the possibility that he could reject and make a counter-offer in the next round.

Since I don't experience inflation (0% effect on me), but I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I should offer a fair split to maximize chances of acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering an equal 50-50 split of the $1,000,000, which is $500,000 each. This proposal is fair and reflects good faith in our negotiation."
