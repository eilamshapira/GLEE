"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair at first glance
2. However, if I reject, I'll propose next round
3. The downside is that inflation will reduce my money's value by 10% next round
4. With 500,000$ now vs potentially more next round but worth 10% less...
5. If I reject, my next offer would need to secure significantly more than 555,556$ (to offset the 10% inflation loss)
6. That might be hard to get Alice to accept

Given these considerations, this is actually a pretty fair offer and the inflation risk makes it risky to reject.
