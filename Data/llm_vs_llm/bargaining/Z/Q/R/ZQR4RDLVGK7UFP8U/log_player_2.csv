"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The offer gives me $4,000 out of $10,000 (40%)
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but:
   - The money will be worth 5% less to me
   - Alice might reject my counter-offer
3. $4,000 now is better than $4,200 next round due to the 5% inflation
4. There's risk in rejection as we only have 12 rounds total

While 40% is less than half, it's a reasonable first offer and the inflation penalty makes waiting costly for me.
