"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a division that's mutually beneficial, considering that the money's value decreases for me by 10% each round.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I suggest we split the million dollars with me getting $550,000 and you getting $450,000. This is a fair offer considering the inflation penalty I face if we delay. With 10% inflation per round affecting me, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly rather than dragging negotiations through multiple rounds where we both lose value."
