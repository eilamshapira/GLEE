"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

This is the first round, so there's no inflation effect yet.
Alice is offering me $450,000, which is 45% of the total.
It's slightly less than half, but it's a reasonable offer.

If I reject:
- Next round I can make a counter-offer
- But my money will be worth 20% less
- Even if I got $500,000 next round, it would only be worth $400,000 to me
- And Alice might reject anyway, leading to more rounds and more inflation

Since $450,000 now is worth more than potentially getting a larger amount in future rounds (due to inflation), and it's a fairly reasonable split, I'll accept.
