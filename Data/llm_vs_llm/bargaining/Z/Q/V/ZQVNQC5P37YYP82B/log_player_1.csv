"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your fairness. Considering that each round further erodes my take-home value, I propose a deal that wraps things up swiftly: $54 for you and $46 for me. This way, we secure our shares now before further discount takes its toll. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 54 
# Bob gain: 46 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
