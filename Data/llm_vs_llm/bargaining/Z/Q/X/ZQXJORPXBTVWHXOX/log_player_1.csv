"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a fair split that slightly favors me, considering I need to account for potential inflation if Bob rejects.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I offer to take $55 and give Bob $45. This is a reasonable first offer that's close to equal while giving me a small advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. Due to inflation, if I accept Bob's 50-50 split now:
* My $50 is worth 20% less, so effectively I'm getting $40 in round 1 value
* Bob gets full $50 value

While this is less favorable than my initial offer, I need to consider that:
1. If I reject, the next round will have another 20% inflation for me
2. We have limited rounds and need to reach agreement
3. Further negotiations might lead to worse outcomes due to compounding inflation

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer since the inflation penalty makes delaying costly for me, and this is still a reasonable split."
