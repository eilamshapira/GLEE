"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because I face 10% inflation each round while you don't, so I need a larger share to compensate for potential value loss.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about the inflation but I think 51/49 split is a fairer starting point. It acknowledges your disadvantage, but also ensures both of us have a substantial share of the money. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer because:
1. While it's not as favorable as my initial proposal, it's still a reasonable split
2. If I reject, my next round's value will decrease by another 10%, making the effective value even lower
3. Bob made a fair point and showed willingness to acknowledge the inflation factor
4. Early agreement prevents value loss from multiple rounds of negotiation"
