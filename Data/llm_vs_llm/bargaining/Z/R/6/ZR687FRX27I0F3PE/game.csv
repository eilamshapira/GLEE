50.0,50.0,"Hi Bob, to avoid the risk of losing value in subsequent rounds due to inflation, I'm proposing an even split right away. I believe a fair deal now benefits us both. Let’s agree and wrap up the game!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I understand your point, Alice, but I believe taking a slight advantage now is beneficial. Let's settle with me getting $60 and you getting $40. It's still a good deal for you.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Bob, I understand your intent to secure an advantage by waiting, but further rounds will only reduce my effective share, potentially complicating negotiations for both of us. To avoid prolonged bargaining and risk of even lower payoffs, I'm offering you $55 while I take $45. I believe this is a fair and stable deal considering the inflation on my side. Let's wrap this up now before the value drops further!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
35.0,65.0,"Alice, I see your concern about inflation, but I'm willing to take a bit more risk. How about I get $65 and you get $35? This way, I gain more, and you still secure an amount before inflation affects it further.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
30.0,70.0,"Hi Bob, I get that waiting might seem tempting for you—but every extra round costs me dearly, and the risk of breakdown increases as we move closer to the final rounds. I’m offering you $70, which is a generous share that you’ll get immediately, while I secure $30 before further losses hit me. Let’s settle now and avoid the uncertainty of future rounds.",Alice,5,
