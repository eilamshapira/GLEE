# Bob's message: I understand your point, Alice, but I believe taking a slight advantage now is beneficial. Let's settle with me getting $60 and you getting $40. It's still a good deal for you.

# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3

Let's wrap this up now before the value drops further!""}"

Round 4

Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 65

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I get that waiting might seem tempting for you—but every extra round costs me dearly, and the risk of breakdown increases as we move closer to the final rounds. I’m offering you $70, which is a generous share that you’ll get immediately, while I secure $30 before further losses hit me. Let’s settle now and avoid the uncertainty of future rounds.""}"
