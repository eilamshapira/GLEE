Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your intent to secure an advantage by waiting, but further rounds will only reduce my effective share, potentially complicating negotiations for both of us. To avoid prolonged bargaining and risk of even lower payoffs, I'm offering you $55 while I take $45. I believe this is a fair and stable deal considering the inflation on my side. Let's wrap this up now before the value drops further!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I get that waiting might seem tempting for you—but every extra round costs me dearly, and the risk of breakdown increases as we move closer to the final rounds. I’m offering you $70, which is a generous share that you’ll get immediately, while I secure $30 before further losses hit me. Let’s settle now and avoid the uncertainty of future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 70 
# Alice gain: 30
