,,Bob,1,reject,
4500.0,5500.0,Bob,2,,"Since you face 5% inflation per round, this split is more favorable now than waiting for future rounds. If we continue to later rounds, the total value to you will decrease, making this a fair offer given the circumstances."

,,Bob,3,reject,
4800.0,5200.0,Bob,4,,"I've adjusted my offer to be more favorable to you compared to my last proposal. With each round, the money loses more value for you due to inflation. This offer gives you a substantial portion while recognizing we both benefit from reaching an agreement soon."

5200.0,4800.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,reject,
4900.0,5100.0,Bob,6,,"I see we're getting closer to an agreement. Since we're now in round 6, the inflation impact on your side is significant. This offer is very close to fair, giving you $4900 while I take $5100. If we continue negotiating, the inflation will only reduce the value of your share further, so this represents a good opportunity to conclude our negotiation."
