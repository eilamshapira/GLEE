"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is proposing that I (Bob) get $4,500 and she gets $5,500. Let me think about this carefully.

Since I don't face any inflation (money is worth 0% less for me each round), but Alice faces 5% inflation per round, I have a slight advantage by waiting. If I reject this offer, I can make a counter-offer in the next round.

This first offer gives me 45% of the total, which isn't terrible, but I believe I can get a better deal given the inflation asymmetry.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation Alice faces. Since the money will be worth 5% less to Alice in this round compared to the previous round, I should be able to negotiate a more favorable split.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""explanation"": ""Since you face 5% inflation per round, this split is more favorable now than waiting for future rounds. If we continue to later rounds, the total value to you will decrease, making this a fair offer given the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me by $100, now proposing I get $4,600 while she gets $5,400.

Let me analyze this:
- For me, there's no inflation penalty, so $4,600 is worth exactly $4,600
- For Alice, her $5,400 is already worth 9.75% less than it would have been in round 1
- If I reject, I can make another offer in round 4, but Alice will experience more inflation

While Alice has moved slightly in my direction, I still think I can get a better deal given the inflation asymmetry. The fact that she faces increasing inflation pressure should work in my favor in later rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice has rejected my previous offer and the inflation effect is continuing to increase for her, I'll make a slightly more balanced offer while still leveraging my inflation advantage.

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""explanation"": ""I've adjusted my offer to be more favorable to you compared to my last proposal. With each round, the money loses more value for you due to inflation. This offer gives you a substantial portion while recognizing we both benefit from reaching an agreement soon.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice has increased her offer to me again, now proposing I get $4,800 while she gets $5,200.

Let me analyze this:
- For me, there's still no inflation penalty, so $4,800 is worth exactly $4,800
- For Alice, her $5,200 is now worth 18.55% less than it would have been in round 1
- The inflation effect for Alice is becoming more significant with each round

Alice has moved closer to a 50-50 split, which shows she's feeling the pressure of inflation. However, given the asymmetric inflation that only affects her, I believe I can still get a better deal by waiting further. The inflation will continue to increase her incentive to reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an offer that acknowledges the increasing inflation pressure on Alice while still leveraging my advantageous position.

{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""explanation"": ""I see we're getting closer to an agreement. Since we're now in round 6, the inflation impact on your side is significant. This offer is very close to fair, giving you $4,900 while I take $5,100. If we continue negotiating, the inflation will only reduce the value of your share further, so this represents a good opportunity to conclude our negotiation.""}"
