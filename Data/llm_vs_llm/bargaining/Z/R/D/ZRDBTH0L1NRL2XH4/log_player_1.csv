"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose you receive $40 and I keep $60. Accepting now ensures we avoid further devaluationâ€”remember, each round costs us 5% in value. Let's conclude this quickly for our mutual benefit!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's split this equally at $50 each. This way, we both benefit fairly and stop any further 5% losses before the value drops again. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
