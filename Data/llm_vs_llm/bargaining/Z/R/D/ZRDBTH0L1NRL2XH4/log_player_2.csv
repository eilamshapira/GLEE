Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose you receive $40 and I keep $60. Accepting now ensures we avoid further devaluationâ€”remember, each round costs us 5% in value. Let's conclude this quickly for our mutual benefit! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
