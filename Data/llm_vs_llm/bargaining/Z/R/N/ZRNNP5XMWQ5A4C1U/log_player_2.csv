"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money equally, 50-50. This is a fair division that benefits us both equally. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice proposes a 50-50 split, which is $5,000 for each of us. This seems fair on the surface, but I need to account for the inflation effect.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, the total value will be worth 10% less to me, meaning the $10,000 pot is only worth $9,000 to me in round 2. However, I could potentially get more than $5,000 in absolute dollars.

Given that we have 12 rounds total and each round decreases the value by 10% for me, it makes sense to accept this fair offer early rather than risk extended negotiations where my purchasing power decreases.
