"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'd like to propose a split where I take $60 and you take $40. I think this is fair given that it's only the first round, and it allows us both to walk away with a decent amount before inflation affects us. Let me know what you think!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about I take $55 and you take $45? This way, we both get a decent amount and can still avoid losing everything to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
