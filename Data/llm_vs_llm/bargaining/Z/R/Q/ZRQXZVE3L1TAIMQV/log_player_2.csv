"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to propose a split where I take $60 and you take $40. I think this is fair given that it's only the first round, and it allows us both to walk away with a decent amount before inflation affects us. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
