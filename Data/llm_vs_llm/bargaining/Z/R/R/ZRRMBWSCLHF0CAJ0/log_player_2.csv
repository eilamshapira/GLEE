"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice has offered me $400,000 (40%) while keeping $600,000 (60%) for herself. While this isn't an even split, it's still a substantial amount of money. I know that:

1. If I reject, I get to make the next offer
2. There's no inflation impact on my end
3. I don't know how inflation affects Alice's valuation

The offer is not terrible, but since I can make a counter-offer with no penalty to myself, I'll try to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a more equitable split, but one that still gives Alice a good incentive to accept. Since I know she was willing to take 60% for herself, I'll propose a more balanced division that's still attractive.

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

This is a perfectly fair 50-50 split. My reasoning is:
1. It's an objectively fair division
2. Since I don't know how inflation affects Alice, offering an equal split is a reasonable approach
3. It's better for Alice than what she might get if she rejects and we continue negotiating
4. It's a significant improvement for me compared to her initial offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has improved her offer from $400,000 to $450,000 for me
2. She's now asking for $550,000 (down from $600,000)
3. I now know that inflation is affecting Alice's gains (-19%)
4. For Alice, $550,000 is now worth about $445,500 (after 19% inflation)
5. My $450,000 still holds its full value
6. If I reject, the inflation will likely increase further for Alice

This is actually a pretty good offer considering:
- I'm getting a better amount than the first round
- The real value for Alice is less than what I'm getting due to inflation
- Further negotiation might lead to more value loss for Alice, making her less likely to make good offers
