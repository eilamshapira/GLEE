6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, I'm proposing we settle now: you get $4000 and I take $6000. Accepting today means we both avoid the cost of delay—while I face a 10% depreciation each round, we can lock in our current values immediately. I believe this split is a fair starting point for both of us. Looking forward to your reply!",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I think a more even split is fair considering the potential for inflation. I'm offering you $4500 and keeping $5500 for myself. Let's see if we can agree on this and avoid further rounds.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thanks for your fair offer. Given that if we continue to another round my money's value drops further (and in round 3 I'd be facing even steeper depreciation), your proposal offering me nominal $4500—which is effectively worth $4050 in round‐1 dollars—is more attractive than the expected outcome if we delay further. I accept your offer.",Alice,2,accept
