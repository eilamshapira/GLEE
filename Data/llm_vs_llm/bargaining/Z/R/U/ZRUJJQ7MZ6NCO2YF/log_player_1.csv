"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm proposing we settle now: you get $4,000 and I take $6,000. Accepting today means we both avoid the cost of delay—while I face a 10% depreciation each round, we can lock in our current values immediately. I believe this split is a fair starting point for both of us. Looking forward to your reply!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think a more even split is fair considering the potential for inflation. I'm offering you $4500 and keeping $5500 for myself. Let's see if we can agree on this and avoid further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your fair offer. Given that if we continue to another round my money's value drops further (and in round 3 I'd be facing even steeper depreciation), your proposal offering me nominal $4500—which is effectively worth $4050 in round‐1 dollars—is more attractive than the expected outcome if we delay further. I accept your offer.""}"
