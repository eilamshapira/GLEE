"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing we settle now: you get $4000 and I take $6000. Accepting today means we both avoid the cost of delayâ€”while I face a 10% depreciation each round, we can lock in our current values immediately. I believe this split is a fair starting point for both of us. Looking forward to your reply! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
