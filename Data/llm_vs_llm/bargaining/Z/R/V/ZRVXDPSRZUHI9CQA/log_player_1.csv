"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a fair offer that takes into account the 10% inflation penalty I'll face if we go to another round.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which I think is fair for both of us. This way we can both walk away with $5,000 right now, and I can avoid the inflation penalty that would reduce the value of my share in future rounds."
