Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I believe in a fair split, but I should get the early mover advantage. Let's settle this quickly and avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer because:
1. The 5% inflation means if I reject, my next proposal would be worth less
2. A 45/55 split is reasonably fair
3. Prolonging negotiations would lead to guaranteed losses for both parties
4. The difference between this and my original proposal isn't worth the inflation risk"
