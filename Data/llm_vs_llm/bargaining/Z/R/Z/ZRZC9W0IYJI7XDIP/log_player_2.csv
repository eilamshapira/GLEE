While a 50/50 split seems fair, I can likely get a better deal in later rounds since I'll be making the offer."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a reasonable offer considering the inflation. Accepting now guarantees a decent amount."
