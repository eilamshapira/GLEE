"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let me propose a fair split while accounting for potential future inflation if Bob declines.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I offer a slightly higher share for myself since I know I'll lose 5% value each round if Bob declines. This is still a reasonable offer that gives Bob a significant portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I accept Bob's 50-50 split now, my $50 is actually worth $47.50 due to the 5% inflation from round 1.

If I reject and make another offer in round 3, any amount I receive will be worth 10% less due to compounding inflation. This means I'd need to secure significantly more than $50 in the next round just to break even with the current offer.

Given this, and since Bob's 50-50 offer is fairly reasonable...
