"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an initial offer that considers both our interests, but I need to be mindful of the different inflation rates affecting us.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a fair 50-50 split of the $10,000. This gives us each $5,000, which seems equitable for our first round. Given that my inflation rate is higher (20% per round) compared to your 5%, I hope we can reach an agreement quickly to maximize value for both of us."
