"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll propose a division that takes into account the inflation penalty for future rounds. Since Bob faces a steeper inflation penalty (20% vs my 10%), he has more incentive to accept an early offer.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I propose this split because it gives Bob a significant portion while still being advantageous to me. If Bob rejects this, in the next round the total value will be worth less for both of us, but especially for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Due to inflation, the $55 offered to me is actually worth $49.50 (90% of $55)
2. For Bob, his $45 is worth $36 (80% of $45)

If I reject and make a new offer in round 3:
- Values will depreciate further (by 20% for Bob and 10% for me)
- Bob might reject again, leading to even more depreciation

The current offer gives me a decent share, and considering the inflation risk, it's better to accept now than risk further depreciation.
