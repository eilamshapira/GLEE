"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make my first offer to Bob to divide the $100.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'd like to propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives both of us a substantial amount, with a slight advantage to me as the first proposer. Since I know inflation will reduce the value by 10% each round, I want to reach an agreement quickly rather than letting the total value diminish."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $45 for me and $55 for him. While I'm getting less than my initial proposal, the 10% inflation means further negotiation would reduce my purchasing power even more. $45 now is better than risking a lower effective amount in future rounds due to continuing inflation."
