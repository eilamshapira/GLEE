"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice has offered me $40 out of $100, keeping $60 for herself. 

While this isn't an equal split, it's a significant portion of the money. Since there's no inflation affecting my share in future rounds, I don't lose value by continuing, but I also don't gain anything by waiting. However, there's uncertainty about how inflation affects Alice's position.

Given that I can make a counter-offer in the next round if I reject, and considering that $40 is a reasonable amount, though not ideal, I'll reject this offer to try for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer of 40-60, I'll propose a more equitable split, but still slightly in my favor since I have the proposal power now. I'll offer a 55-45 split, which is more balanced than her initial offer while giving me a small advantage.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}

This offer is fairer than the previous one and should be more appealing to Alice while improving my position."
