"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice is offering me $4,000 out of $10,000, which is 40% of the total amount. Her money loses 5% value each round, while mine doesn't depreciate. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round when her portion would be worth less to her.

Since we have 11 more rounds and her money depreciates by 5% each round, I can likely negotiate a better deal. With this leverage, I should be able to get more than 40%.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's money depreciates by 5% each round, her $6000 from the previous offer would now be worth $5700 to her. I'll offer her slightly less than her initial proposal, using this depreciation to my advantage.

{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500}

This offer gives me a better share while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept it rather than risk further depreciation of her portion in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Alice has increased my share from her initial offer ($4000 â†’ $4300)
2. Her $5700 is actually worth less to her now (about $5144 in round 1 value) due to the 9.75% depreciation
3. My $4300 maintains its full value since there's no depreciation for me
4. We still have 9 rounds left, and her money will continue to depreciate
5. However, if we keep rejecting, we risk getting nothing if we don't reach agreement within 12 rounds

While I could potentially get more by continuing to negotiate, this offer is a reasonable improvement from the first round, and the risk of getting nothing increases with each rejection. Furthermore, Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by improving my share.
