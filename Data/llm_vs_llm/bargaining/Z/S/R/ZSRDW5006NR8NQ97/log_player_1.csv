Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too risky for me. How about a slightly more balanced approach? 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me evaluate this:
- If I accept now, I get $55, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, so effectively $49.5
- If I reject and we go to next round, future money will be worth even less (20% less)
- My previous offer of $60 (worth $54 after 10% inflation) was rejected
- This is a reasonable counter-offer given the inflation risk
