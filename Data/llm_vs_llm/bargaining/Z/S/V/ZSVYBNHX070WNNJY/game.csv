5556.0,4444.0,"Hi Bob, in order to avoid the 20% devaluation in future rounds, I propose an immediate agreement. By my calculations, waiting isnâ€™t beneficial for either of us. I suggest I take $5556 and you take $4444 from the $10000 pot. This division reflects our mutual discount rate and ensures that you get a fair discounted share without devaluation. I hope you agree and we can conclude this deal promptly!",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe a 50-50 split is fairer, especially considering the devaluation. Let's agree on $5000 each from the remaining $10000, which would be more equitable before further loss in value. What do you say?",Bob,2,
