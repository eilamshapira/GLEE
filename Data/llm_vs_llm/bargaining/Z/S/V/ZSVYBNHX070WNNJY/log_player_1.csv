"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5556, ""bob_gain"": 4444, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, in order to avoid the 20% devaluation in future rounds, I propose an immediate agreement. By my calculations, waiting isnâ€™t beneficial for either of us. I suggest I take $5,556 and you take $4,444 from the $10,000 pot. This division reflects our mutual discount rate and ensures that you get a fair discounted share without devaluation. I hope you agree and we can conclude this deal promptly!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe a 50-50 split is fairer, especially considering the devaluation. Let's agree on $5000 each from the remaining $10000, which would be more equitable before further loss in value. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
