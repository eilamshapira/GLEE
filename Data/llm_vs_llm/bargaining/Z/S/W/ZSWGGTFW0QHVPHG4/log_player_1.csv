"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic about the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $450,000, but it's worth 10% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $450,000 * 0.9 = $405,000.

Since Bob's offer doesn't seem very favorable to me, I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less for me, and I need to make a more attractive offer to Bob to avoid further devaluation.

In Round 3, the value of the money for me is 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value, and for Bob, it's 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of the original value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 520000, 
""bob_gain"": 480000, 
""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, a fair split considering the time value of money.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is money Alice, this is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Considering the inflation, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $480,000, but it's worth 27.1% less than the original value. So, the actual value I'll get is $480,000 * 0.729 = $349,920.

Bob's offer is not very generous, but I need to consider the rapidly decreasing value of the money. If I reject this offer, the value will decrease even further, and I might end up with an even worse deal.

Given the significant devaluation of the money, I think it's time to accept Bob's offer and secure a deal rather than risking further losses.
