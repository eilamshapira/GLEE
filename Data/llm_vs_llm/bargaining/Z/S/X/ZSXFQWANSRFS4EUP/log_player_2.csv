"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we settle immediately to avoid further loss due to time. My offer is that I receive $600000 and you receive $400000. I believe this division fairly recognizes the cost of delay, and I look forward to your agreement. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $400,000 out of the $1,000,000, which means she would get $600,000. Since I face 20% inflation per round, if I reject now, the total value will be worth 20% less to me in the next round.

If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round, but the total amount will effectively be worth $800,000 to me. I would need to get more than $400,000 of that $800,000 to come out ahead compared to accepting Alice's current offer.

Given the significant inflation penalty I face and the risk of prolonged negotiation further reducing the money's value, I'll accept this first offer.
