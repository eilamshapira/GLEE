"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, let's calculate the adjusted value and make a new offer.

*   **My Inflation:** My money is worth 20% less in round 2 and another 20% less in round 3 (relative to round 2). So, my effective worth is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original value.
*   **Bob's Inflation:** Bob's money is worth 5% less in round 2. Let's assume it's worth another 5% less in round 3 (relative to round 2), so 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of the original value. I don't know Bob's risk aversion, but I'll need to make a compelling offer.

I need to balance getting a reasonable amount now with the risk of further inflation. I'll try to be a bit more generous while still prioritizing my needs given the inflation effect on me.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze this. My money is now worth only 51.2% of the original value, while Bob's is worth 85.74%. Bob is offering me $4000, which is worth 0.512 * 4000 = $2048 in original value to me. He is getting $6000, worth 0.8574 * 6000 = $5144.4 in original value to him.

Since my value is decreasing rapidly, getting something now is better than potentially getting nothing (or very little) later.
