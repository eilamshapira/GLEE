"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to make an offer to Bob, keeping in mind the rapidly decreasing value of the money for me. I want to secure a good portion of the money early on.

Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   I'm asking for a larger share (65%) because I know the money will be worth significantly less to me in later rounds due to inflation.
*   I'm offering Bob 35%, which is a reasonable amount, hoping he'll accept it rather than risk getting less in future rounds. I don't know how inflation will affect him so I am playing it safe by giving him a sizable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Okay, I see Bob rejected my initial offer. Now, the value of the money for me has decreased by 20%. Let's analyze Bob's offer:

*   **Bob's Offer:** Alice: $550,000, Bob: $450,000

Here's my thought process:

*   **My Perspective:** My money is now worth 80% of what it was in Round 1. So, $550,000 in this round is equivalent to $550,000 * 0.8 = $440,000 of original value.
*   **Risk of Rejection:** If I reject, the value drops again in the next round.
*   **Bob's Motivation:** Bob might be trying to get a better deal, or he might not be aware of my inflation.

Given that the money is losing value quickly *for me*, and $440,000 of original value is not terrible, I'm inclined to accept the offer rather than risk another round of inflation.

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
