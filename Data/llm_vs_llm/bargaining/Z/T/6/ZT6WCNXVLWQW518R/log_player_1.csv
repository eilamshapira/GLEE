Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is fair for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with each round the pie shrinks by 20%. If you reject this offer, you'll have the advantage of proposing in Round 3, but you'll face a 36% reduction in the total value. This split gives you exactly what you'd expect by waiting, while I secure a slightly larger share as the proposer. I believe this division is fair given the time discountingâ€”please accept. 
# Alice gain: 4444 
# Bob gain: 5556 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains.  Let's stop wasting time with unfair offers and split this evenly.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option, especially now that inflation has taken a bite.""}"
