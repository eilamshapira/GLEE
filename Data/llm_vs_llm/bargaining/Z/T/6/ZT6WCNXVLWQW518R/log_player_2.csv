Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains.  Let's stop wasting time with unfair offers and split this evenly.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option, especially now that inflation has taken a bite. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
