6000.0,4000.0,Let's make a fair split considering the different inflation rates. I'm offering you 4000$ which is a reasonable share given that your money devalues more slowly than mine.,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,I think a 55/45 split is more fair considering the difference in inflation rates.  Let's make this deal and move on.,Bob,2,

5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, let's be practical. With each round, we both lose value - I lose 10% and you lose 5%. A 58/42 split is fair compensation for my higher inflation rate, and we should agree now before we both lose more value. This is a reasonable middle ground between our previous offers.",Alice,3,

4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, we're both losing money here. Let's be reasonable and split it 52/48. This is a fair compromise considering our different inflation rates. I'm willing to give a little more than my previous offer, but we need to reach an agreement soon.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, we're both losing significant value now - I've lost over 27% while you've lost 14%. Let's meet closer to the middle with a 55/45 split. This is a genuine compromise from my previous position, considering my higher inflation rate. We should agree now before we both lose even more value.",Alice,5,
