Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair considering the difference in inflation rates.  Let's make this deal and move on. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The offer isn't favorable enough given the asymmetric inflation rates. Since my money devalues faster (10% vs 5%), I should receive a larger portion to compensate for this disadvantage. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, 
""bob_gain"": 4200, 
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. With each round, we both lose value - I lose 10% and you lose 5%. A 58/42 split is fair compensation for my higher inflation rate, and we should agree now before we both lose more value. This is a reasonable middle ground between our previous offers.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money here. Let's be reasonable and split it 52/48. This is a fair compromise considering our different inflation rates. I'm willing to give a little more than my previous offer, but we need to reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

The inflation impact is becoming significant - I've already lost 27.1% of potential value while Bob has only lost 14.26%. This growing gap in our effective gains makes Bob's 52/48 split still unfavorable. A larger share is needed to compensate for my higher inflation rate."

This is a genuine compromise from my previous position, considering my higher inflation rate. We should agree now before we both lose even more value.""}"
