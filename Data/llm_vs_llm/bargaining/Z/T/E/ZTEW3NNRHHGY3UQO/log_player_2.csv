Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a fair split considering the different inflation rates. I'm offering you 4000$ which is a reasonable share given that your money devalues more slowly than mine.

# Alice gain: 6000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. With each round, we both lose value - I lose 10% and you lose 5%. A 58/42 split is fair compensation for my higher inflation rate, and we should agree now before we both lose more value. This is a reasonable middle ground between our previous offers. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800
