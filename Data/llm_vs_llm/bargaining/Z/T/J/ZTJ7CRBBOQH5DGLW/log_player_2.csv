"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice after each round, I'll take that into account for my offer.

The value of the money for me after 1 round is 10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000
The value of the money for Alice after 1 round is 10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000

Considering this, my offer for round 2 is:
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 19% less for me, the actual value I get is:
5000 * 0.81 = $4050

And for Alice, the money is worth 36% less, but that's her concern, not mine.

Considering this, I think the offer is not in my favor, so I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 19% less for me after 2 rounds (10% in round 1 and 9.1% in round 2, for a total of 19.01% less, approximately 19%) and 36% less for Alice after 2 rounds (20% in round 1 and 16% in round 2, for a total of 36% less, but actually 36% is the correct value after two rounds, 20% in the first round and then 16% of the remaining value in the second round), I'll take that into account for my offer.

The value of the money for me after 3 rounds is 10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $7,291
The value of the money for Alice after 3 rounds is 10,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $4,096

Considering this, my offer for round 4 is:
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 34.39% less for me, the actual value I get is:
6000 * (1 - 0.3439) = 6000 * 0.6561 = $3936.6

And for Alice, the money is worth 59.04% less, but that's her concern, not mine.

Considering this, I think the offer is still not very favorable to me, but it's getting closer to being acceptable. However, I'll still reject it to see if I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 34.39% less for me after 4 rounds and 59.04% less for Alice after 4 rounds, and another round has passed, I'll take that into account for my offer.

The value of the money for me after 5 rounds is 10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $5,904.9
The value of the money for Alice after 5 rounds is 10,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $2,621.44

Considering this, my offer for round 6 is:
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6500 
# Alice gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 46.86% less for me, the actual value I get is:
6500 * (1 - 0.4686) = 6500 * 0.5314 = $3454.1

Considering this, I think the offer is becoming more reasonable. Given the significant decrease in value for both of us, I'm starting to think that getting something is better than risking getting nothing.
