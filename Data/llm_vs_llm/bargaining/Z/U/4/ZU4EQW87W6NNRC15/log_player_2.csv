"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it equally, so we both get a fair share! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze this offer:

Alice is proposing a 50-50 split, which would give me $5,000 and her $5,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round, the money will be worth 10% less to me due to inflation. This means the total value to me would be $9,000 instead of $10,000. Even if I could get a larger share in the next round, I need to consider this reduction in value.

A 50-50 split is fair, and accepting now guarantees me $5,000 without risking further depreciation of value.
