6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob! Considering the 10% inflation penalty I face with each round, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because delaying would decrease the real value for me while you might not face the same penalty. Let's resolve this efficiently.",Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"Hi Alice! I appreciate your proposal, but I believe we should split the amount evenly. This way, both of us can benefit equally without risking losing everything due to inflation. Let's settle on a 50-50 split.",Bob,2,

5800.0,4200.0,"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I notice inflation is affecting you more severely (20% per round) than me (10% per round). Given this information, I'm proposing a 58-42 split which is more balanced when accounting for our different inflation rates. This way, we can reach a fair agreement that considers our different situations. Let's avoid further rounds where both of us lose more value.",Alice,3,
