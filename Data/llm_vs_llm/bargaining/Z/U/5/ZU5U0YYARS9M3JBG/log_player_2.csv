"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Considering the 10% inflation penalty I face with each round, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because delaying would decrease the real value for me while you might not face the same penalty. Let's resolve this efficiently. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

I appreciate your proposal, but I believe we should split the amount evenly. This way, both of us can benefit equally without risking losing everything due to inflation. Let's settle on a 50-50 split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I notice inflation is affecting you more severely (20% per round) than me (10% per round). Given this information, I'm proposing a 58-42 split which is more balanced when accounting for our different inflation rates. This way, we can reach a fair agreement that considers our different situations. Let's avoid further rounds where both of us lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800
