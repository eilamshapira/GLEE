"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly! I'll take a bit more to start, but it's a good deal for both of us given the time limit. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this carefully:

1. Alice is offering me $450,000 of the $1,000,000
2. If I reject, we go to the next round where:
   - I can make a counter-offer
   - But my money will be worth 5% less
   - $450,000 now > $475,000 in the next round (after 5% loss)
3. Alice isn't affected by inflation, so she has less pressure to agree quickly
4. The split (45-55) is reasonably fair given the circumstances

While I could try to negotiate for more, the inflation penalty makes this a decent offer. If Alice rejects my counter-offer, we'd lose more rounds and value.
