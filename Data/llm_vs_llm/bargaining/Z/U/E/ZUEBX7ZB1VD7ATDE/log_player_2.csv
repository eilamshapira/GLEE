"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. It's a fair 50-50 split
2. If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less for me in the next round
3. Even if I make a more favorable proposal next round, Alice might reject it
4. Getting $5000 now is better than risking a lower value due to inflation
5. This is a reasonable first offer that avoids the risk of getting nothing
