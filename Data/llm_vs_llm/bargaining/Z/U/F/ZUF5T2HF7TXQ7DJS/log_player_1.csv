"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable but favorable offer for myself, considering the 20% inflation penalty per round if rejected.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This offer gives Bob a substantial portion while keeping a larger share for myself. I'd justify this split because if Bob rejects it, the total amount will be worth less in the next round due to inflation affecting my gains. It's a fair starting point that leaves room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $5500, but due to 20% inflation, it's actually worth $4400 (5500 * 0.8)
- If I reject and we continue, any future gains will be worth even less to me due to compounding 20% inflation
- Bob's offer is reasonably fair, giving me the majority while keeping a good portion
- Rejecting means risking further value loss, and Bob might make a worse offer next time
- Getting $4400 in real value now is better than risking further depreciation
