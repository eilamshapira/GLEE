"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since your money loses 5% value each round, 450k now is better than 600k next round which would only be worth 427.5k to you. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
