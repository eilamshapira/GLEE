"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40 seems reasonable""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'll take 5500, you get 4500. My turn's inflation-adjusted now, remember! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same, but Bob's offer gives him more than my initial offer, and considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not in my favor and considering the inflation effect on his gain, I'll make a new offer. 

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""My turn again, considering inflation, this seems more reasonable now""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, inflation is hurting me! How about I get 5250 and you get 4750? This is my best offer. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant inflation effect on Bob's gain (14.26% less) and his message that this is his best offer, I think this offer is more reasonable. Although it's still not in my favor, the inflation effect on Bob's gain might put him in a tougher spot. I'll accept this offer to avoid further risks.
