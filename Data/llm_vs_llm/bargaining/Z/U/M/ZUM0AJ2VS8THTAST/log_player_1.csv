"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Let me make a strategic first offer. Since Bob faces a 10% depreciation per round while I don't, I can use this to my advantage.

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I propose I get $7,000 and Bob gets $3,000. While this may seem unfair at first glance, Bob should consider that if he rejects this offer, his next round's money will be worth 10% less to him. This means if he rejects, his $10,000 will effectively be worth only $9,000 to him in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob offers me $4,000 (worth full value to me)
2. Bob wants $6,000 (but it's only worth $5,400 to him due to 10% depreciation)
3. If I reject, in the next round:
   - I can make a new offer
   - But Bob's portion will be worth another 10% less
   - This gives me more negotiating power

I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer. In the next round, Bob's share will be worth even less to him, which should make him more willing to accept a more favorable split for me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now that we're in round 3, Bob's money has depreciated by 20% from the original value. This means any amount he gets will be worth only 80% of its nominal value to him. Let me make a strategic offer considering this:

{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}

I propose I get $7,500 and Bob gets $2,500. Here's why this is reasonable:
1. For me, I get $7,500 at full value
2. For Bob, $2,500 at 80% value is worth $2,000 to him
3. If he rejects, in the next round his money will be worth only 70% of the nominal value, making his position even weaker

This offer gives Bob a clear incentive to accept, as further delays will only decrease the value of his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this offer:

1. Bob offers me $5,000 (worth full value to me)
2. Bob wants $5,000 (but it's only worth $3,645 to him due to 27.1% depreciation)
3. If I reject:
   - I can make a new offer next round
   - Bob's money will depreciate by another 10%, making his share worth about 35% less than original value
   - This gives me even more negotiating power

While this offer is better than his previous one, I believe I can still get a better deal by rejecting. The increasing depreciation on Bob's side puts me in a stronger negotiating position for the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now that we're in round 5, Bob's money has depreciated significantly (about 35% from the original value). This puts me in a very strong negotiating position. Let me make an offer that should be compelling for Bob to accept given the circumstances:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I propose I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. Here's why this is reasonable:
1. For me, I get $8,000 at full value
2. For Bob, $2,000 at ~65% value is worth about $1,300 to him
3. If he rejects, his money will depreciate even further in the next round
4. The longer this goes on, the less valuable any amount becomes for Bob

Given the significant depreciation Bob faces, this offer provides him with a strong incentive to accept rather than risk further value loss through continued negotiation."
