"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is even worse than the first one, considering inflation. I'm hoping Alice will be more reasonable in the next round, as the money will be worth even less for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000} 

The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, so I'm proposing a more straightforward 50/50 split. This is fair and hopefully prevents me from getting even less in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is far from ideal, but given the inflation and the fact that Alice is unlikely to offer me more, accepting is the best option I have left."
