"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Based on a standard bargaining‑analysis (using backward‐induction with the players’ “waiting” losses in value—5% per round for you and 20% for Bob), one can show that in a subgame‑perfect equilibrium the proposer (Alice in Round 1) will secure roughly 83.33% of the “pie” while offering Bob an amount equal to the discounted equivalent of what he’d get if he made the next offer. (In our setup, if Bob were to reject and become proposer in Round 2, his best guaranteed nominal value would be about 208,333.33; but because money then is worth only 80% to him, his “threat value” is 0.80×208,333.33 ≈ 166,666.67.) 

Thus an equilibrium offer in Round 1 is to propose a split of about

  Alice: 833,333.33  
  Bob: 166,666.67

Below is the offer in JSON format:
