"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm proposing a deal to split the $10000 as $6000 for me and $4000 for you. The sooner we settle, the better it is for me since the value decreases by 20% for me each round. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I hope you agree that it's sensible to lock in our shares now. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. Alice is offering me $4000 out of $10000, which is 40% of the total.

If I reject and propose in the next round:
- The money will be worth 20% less to me
- $10000 in round 2 will be worth $8000 to me
- Even if I could get a larger share, it might not be worth as much due to inflation

Alice's offer of $4000 now is equivalent to getting $5000 in the next round due to the 20% inflation. To get a better deal, I would need to secure significantly more than 50% in the next round, which Alice might reject.

Given the significant inflation penalty and the risk of further devaluation in subsequent rounds, I should probably accept this offer. While not a perfect 50-50 split, $4000 now is better than risking a worse outcome later.
