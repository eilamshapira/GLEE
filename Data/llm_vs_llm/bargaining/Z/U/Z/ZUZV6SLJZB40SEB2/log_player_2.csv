Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, since you're not happy with the 60/40, I'm meeting you halfway. How about 55/45? Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm rejecting this offer. While it might seem tempting, it's important to remember that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me. Alice is likely aware of this and trying to secure a favorable deal while the difference in perceived value is significant.  I need to push for a better split in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  Time is running out and the value is decreasing.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This reflects the urgency for me to reach an agreement quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking, and the value of the money is dropping for me. I'm giving you slightly more now, hoping we can finally agree on 52.5/47.5. Let's finalize this! 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting frustrating, but I have to reject again. Alice is clearly aware that the devaluation hurts me more than her, and she's using it to her advantage. Holding out for another round is risky, but I need to aim for a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm willing to settle for 65/35, but this is my final offer.  We need to agree now before the money becomes practically worthless for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, last call. I'm proposing 51/49. Take it or leave it. The longer we wait, the worse it is for everyone! 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is far from ideal, but I have to be realistic. Accepting a near 50/50 split at this point is the best I can hope for considering the dwindling value of the money and the limited time remaining."
