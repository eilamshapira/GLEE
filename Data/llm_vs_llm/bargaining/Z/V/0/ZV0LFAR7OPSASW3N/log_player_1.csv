"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider the actual value of the offer. 
The original value of $450,000 is now worth $450,000 * 0.95 = $427,500 for me.
I'll consider this when making my decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 10% less than the original value (5% less in each of the two rounds), and the money Bob gains is worth 19% less (10% less in each of the two rounds).

To calculate the actual values:
For me: $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.05)^2 = $1,000,000 * 0.95^2 = $1,000,000 * 0.9025
For Bob: $1,000,000 * (1 - 0.10)^2 = $1,000,000 * 0.90^2 = $1,000,000 * 0.81

I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","To calculate the actual value of the offer:
The original value of $420,000 is now worth $420,000 * (1 - 0.05)^3 = $420,000 * 0.95^3 = $420,000 * 0.857375 = $359,899.5 for me.

Considering this, I'll make my decision.
