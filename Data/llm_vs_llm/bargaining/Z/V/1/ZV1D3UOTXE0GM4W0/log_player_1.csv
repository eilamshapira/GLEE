"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is unfair, so I propose a 55-45 split in my favor as I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of a 45-55 split. While it's slightly in his favor, it's a reasonable compromise and better than risking further rounds of negotiation where we might both end up with less."
