"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Okay, I understand the game. I need to maximize my gain, taking into account the inflation for Bob. Here's my offer for round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob $40. I believe this is a reasonable starting point. Bob's money devalues by 20% each round, so he might be willing to accept this initial offer to avoid further loss. I'm keeping a larger share for myself, but still giving Bob a significant portion."
