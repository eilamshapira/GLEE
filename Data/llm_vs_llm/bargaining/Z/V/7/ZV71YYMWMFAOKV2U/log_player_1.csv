Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering inflation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that inflation affects you more. Let's settle for this offer, or the value will keep decreasing for both of us, and I'll be losing more in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate this offer considering inflation and future bargaining prospects.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

This is a reasonable offer given the inflation dynamics. Bob's offer gives me $4,500, which under 20% inflation is worth $4,500 Ã— 0.8 = $3,600 in round 1 terms. If I reject and counter-offer in round 3, the money will be worth even less to me due to the compounding 20% inflation. Additionally, Bob revealed he faces 10% inflation, so he has less incentive to delay than I do. Taking $4,500 now (worth $3,600 in original value) is better than risking further rounds where my bargaining position weakens due to the higher inflation rate I face."
