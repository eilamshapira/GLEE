"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I suggest a fair split where I get 55% and you get 45%. This way we both walk away with a substantial amount without risking inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing I receive $450,000 while she gets $550,000. If I reject this, we'll move to round 2, but the total amount will decrease by 20% to $800,000. If I were to get exactly half in the next round, that would be $400,000, which is less than what I'm being offered now.
