"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more equitable this time.  I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, recognizing your initial move.  This is a fair compromise, and we can avoid further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this...

If I accept now:
- I get $45, but with 10% inflation, it's worth $40.50 to me
- Bob gets $55 at full value

If I reject and make a new offer next round:
- Any money I get will be worth 20% less due to inflation
- I'd need to get significantly more to make up for the inflation loss
- Bob might reject again, leading to even more inflation

Given that my money is already devalued by 10%, and the risk of further devaluation in future rounds, Bob's offer of $45 (worth $40.50 to me) is reasonable enough to accept.
