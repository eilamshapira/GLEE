"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's agree on an even split. Since every round means a 20% devaluation for me, it's best for both of us to settle now and avoid unnecessary delays. Looking forward to a fair resolution! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer is an even split, which seems fair, and considering that the money will devalue over time, it's reasonable to accept the offer to avoid potential losses due to inflation.
