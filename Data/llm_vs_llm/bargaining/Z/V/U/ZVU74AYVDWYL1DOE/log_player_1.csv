"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing for me each round. It's crucial to secure a reasonable amount sooner rather than later.
* **Bob's likely strategy:** Bob rejected my initial offer where I had a larger share, aiming for a 50/50 split.  He's likely to be anchored to that idea.
* **Compromise:** My offer is a compromise â€“ a slight edge for me to offset inflation, but closer to his desired 50/50 split than my previous offer. This increases the chances of him accepting and me not losing more value in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Inflation:**  The money is now worth almost half its original value to me.  Delaying further is very risky.
* **Downward Trend:** Bob's offer is getting worse for me with each round. He's clearly willing to wait out the inflation.
* **Cutting Losses:** Accepting $4,500 now is better than risking a worse offer in round 5 where the value would be even lower due to inflation."
