"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that you face higher inflation (20%) than I do (10%), this split is actually favorable for both of us. If we go another round, your share would be worth even less. Let's make a deal now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
