"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I propose we split it 60-40 in my favor. Given the inflation rates, this seems fair to start with. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Current offer: I get $40, Alice gets $60
2. If I reject and propose next round:
   * Money is worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice
   * So $100 next round is effectively worth $90 to me and $80 to Alice
   * I could propose a more favorable split next round

Since Alice will experience higher inflation (20% vs my 10%), I have a stronger negotiating position by waiting. I could potentially get a better deal next round since she'll be more eager to avoid further devaluation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Let me make a strategic offer:

The money is now worth 90$ to me and 80$ to Alice due to inflation. Since Alice faces higher inflation, I should propose a split that's more in my favor, but still attractive enough for her to accept rather than risk another round of steeper inflation for her.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Given that you face higher inflation (20%) than I do (10%), this split is actually favorable for both of us. If we go another round, your share would be worth even less. Let's make a deal now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering the increasing impact of inflation on both of us, I propose we split it 50-50 this round. It's fair and takes into account our different inflation rates. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:

1. Current offer: $50 each
   * Due to 19% inflation, my $50 is worth effectively $40.50
   * Due to 36% inflation, Alice's $50 is worth effectively $32

2. If I reject and go to next round:
   * Money will depreciate further (to 29% for me, 56% for Alice)
   * The negotiating position is still in my favor due to Alice's higher inflation rate
   * However, we're both losing significant value

This is actually a reasonable offer considering:
- It's a fair nominal split
- Due to different inflation rates, I'm actually getting better real value ($40.50 vs $32)
- Further delays will significantly hurt both of us
- The difference in our inflation rates is already working in my favor in this deal
