0.0,1000000.0,"Hi Bob, I know that if we delay even one more round my share loses 10% in value while yours remains intact. In the next round you would be the proposer and could secure the full $1000000. To avoid any delay (and since you’d be no worse off by waiting), I’m offering you the entire amount right now. Please accept this offer.",Alice,1,
