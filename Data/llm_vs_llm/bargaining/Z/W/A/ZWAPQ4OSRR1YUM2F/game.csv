3000.0,7000.0,"Hi Bob, I'd like to propose a quick agreement to avoid any inflation losses. I suggest splitting the $10000 so that you receive $7000 and I receive $3000. This way you secure a generous share at full value today, while I avoid the 5% devaluation that comes with delaying. I hope you see the benefit in finalizing this deal now rather than risking further loss down the line. Looking forward to your thoughts!",Alice,1,
