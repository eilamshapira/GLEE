"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's proposing I get $400,000 while she gets $600,000.

With 20% inflation per round for me (but not for Alice), if I reject this offer:
- In round 2, the maximum value to me would be $800,000 ($1,000,000 with 20% inflation)
- If negotiations continue further, my potential value decreases more

While the offer isn't exactly equal, getting $400,000 now is a significant amount, and the risk of ending with less by continuing negotiations is substantial given my inflation penalty.
