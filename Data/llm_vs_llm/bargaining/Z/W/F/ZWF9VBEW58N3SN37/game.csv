500000.0,500000.0,"Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I can be patient in our negotiation. I believe a 50-50 split is the fairest approach when dividing the money. This gives us each $500000, which is substantial and equitable. I hope you'll agree this is a reasonable division that respects both our interests.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. Although a 50-50 split gives me a nominal $500000, due to inflation my effective value is $400000. Given the fact that waiting further would discount my share even more, I believe accepting your proposal now is the best choice. Looking forward to finalizing our agreement!",Alice,2,accept
