"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, here's my first proposal: I'll receive $850,000 and you get $150,000. Accepting now prevents further devaluation on my end due to inflation. I believe this is a fair division given the circumstances. Looking forward to your response!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I can be patient in our negotiation. I believe a 50-50 split is the fairest approach when dividing the money. This gives us each $500000, which is substantial and equitable. I hope you'll agree this is a reasonable division that respects both our interests. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. Although a 50-50 split gives me a nominal $500,000, due to inflation my effective value is $400,000. Given the fact that waiting further would discount my share even more, I believe accepting your proposal now is the best choice. Looking forward to finalizing our agreement!""}"
