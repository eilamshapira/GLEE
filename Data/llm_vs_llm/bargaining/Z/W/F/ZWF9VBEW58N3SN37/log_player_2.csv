"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my first proposal: I'll receive $850000 and you get $150000. Accepting now prevents further devaluation on my end due to inflation. I believe this is a fair division given the circumstances. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me $150,000 out of the $1,000,000 total, which means she would get $850,000. That's a significantly uneven split in her favor.

The instructions mentioned that inflation doesn't affect me (0% inflation for my side), so there's no pressure for me to accept a low offer due to devaluation concerns. This gives me strategic flexibility to negotiate for a better deal.

Since rejecting allows me to make a counter-offer in the next round without any penalty to me, I should reject this unbalanced proposal and aim for a more equitable division.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced division that acknowledges both our positions in this negotiation.

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. Since inflation doesn't affect me, I can be patient in our negotiation. I believe a 50-50 split is the fairest approach when dividing the money. This gives us each $500,000, which is substantial and equitable. I hope you'll agree this is a reasonable division that respects both our interests.""}"
