"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Based on the current round and the 5% inflation, my perspective has shifted. My initial $6000 offer is now worth less to me. 

Therefore, I will **accept** this offer.
