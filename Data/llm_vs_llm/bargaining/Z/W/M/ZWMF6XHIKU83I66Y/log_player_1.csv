"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair initial offer, considering that inflation will reduce the value of money in future rounds if Bob rejects.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split of the money, which is fair and gives both of us a significant amount. Since I know I'll lose 10% value each round if Bob rejects, this is a reasonable starting point that should be acceptable to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $450,000 (worth 90% of original value) = $405,000 effective value
- If I reject and make a new offer next round, any amount I get will be worth 80% of original value
- Bob is offering me a slightly smaller amount but considering inflation, accepting now is better than risking another round
