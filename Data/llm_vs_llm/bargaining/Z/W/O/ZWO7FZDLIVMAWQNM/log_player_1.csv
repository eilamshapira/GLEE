"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and avoid losses due to inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly to avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider the actual value of the offer.

The original amount was $10,000, and due to inflation, the value for me decreased by 5%, making it $9,500. Bob's offer gives me $5,000, which is roughly 52.6% of the decreased value.

Considering this, I think I can get a better deal if I wait.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now due to inflation, I'll make a new offer.

For me, the original $10,000 is now worth $9,500 (after 5% decrease in Round 1) and another 5% decrease in this round, making it $9,025. For Bob, the original $10,000 is now worth $9,000 (after 10% decrease in Round 1) and another 10% decrease in this round, making it $8,100.

Considering this, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreased value:

{""alice_gain"": 6500, 
""bob_gain"": 3500, 
""message"": ""Let's end this before we both lose more value!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split considering the inflation rates affecting both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of the offer considering the inflation.

The original amount was $10,000. Due to inflation, the value for me decreased by 5% in Round 1, then another 5% in Round 2, and another 5% in Round 3 (but the decrease is compounded), and then another 5% decrease is applied to the original value for this round but considering the previous decreases, making the total decrease approximately 14.26% ((1 - 0.95^3) * 100%), making the value for me $8,574.

The offer gives me $5,500, which is roughly 64.1% of the decreased value.

For Bob, the value decreased by 10% in Round 1, then another 10% in Round 2, and another 10% in Round 3, making the total decrease approximately 27.1% ((1 - 0.9^3) * 100%), making the value for Bob $7,291.

Considering this, Bob's offer seems relatively fair, and I should consider accepting to avoid further losses.
