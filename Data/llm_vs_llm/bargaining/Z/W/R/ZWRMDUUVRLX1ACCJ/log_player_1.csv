"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll propose a fair split, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I propose this split because it's reasonably fair while giving me a slight advantage as the first mover. Bob should find this acceptable since rejecting it would mean dealing with 20% inflation in the next round, making the total pot worth only $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this. If I reject Bob's offer:
- The money will be worth another 20% less in the next round
- The total pot will be worth $640,000 in round 3
- I would get to make the next offer
- But we're losing significant value with each rejection

Bob's offer gives me $450,000, which is fairly reasonable and only slightly less than what I offered him. Given the significant inflation penalty, it would be unwise to reject this and risk further devaluation.
