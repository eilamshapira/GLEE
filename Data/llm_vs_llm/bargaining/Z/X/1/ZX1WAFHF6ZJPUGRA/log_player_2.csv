"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair start, Bob. Let's secure a win-win situation! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice is offering me $100,000 (10%) while keeping $900,000 (90%) for herself
2. This is quite an uneven split
3. Since there are 12 rounds available and no inflation penalty for me, I can safely reject this and make a counter-offer
4. A more equitable distribution would be better

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll propose a more balanced split while remaining diplomatic:

{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 50-50 split would be more fair for both of us. This way we both walk away with a significant amount.""
}"
