"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing an even 50-50 split, which seems fair on the surface. However, with 20% inflation affecting me each round, if I reject this offer, the total value will be worth less to me in the next round.

If I reject, I'll get to make an offer next round, but the total $1,000,000 will only be worth $800,000 to me due to inflation. Even if I proposed to take all of it, it would be less than the $500,000 being offered now.
