"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider the offer carefully. Alice is proposing that I get $4,500 while she gets $5,500 of the $10,000.

If I reject and make a counter-offer next round, I need to account for the 5% inflation penalty that applies only to me. This means the $10,000 would be worth only $9,500 to me in the next round, while still worth $10,000 to Alice.

Given this inflation penalty, accepting $4,500 now might be better than risking a rejection of my counter-offer later when the money is worth less to me.
