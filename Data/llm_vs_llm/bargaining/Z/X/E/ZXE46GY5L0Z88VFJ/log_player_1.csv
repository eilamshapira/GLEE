"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a fair first offer to Bob, keeping in mind that the pot loses 10% value each round.

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50-50 split, which gives us each $500,000. This is a fair division that maximizes our combined outcome, and since we're facing 10% inflation each round, we'd both benefit from accepting this deal now rather than continuing to negotiate."
