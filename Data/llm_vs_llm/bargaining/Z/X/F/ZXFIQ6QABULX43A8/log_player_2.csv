"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's offer.

Alice proposes I get $40 and she gets $60.

Considering inflation, if I reject and we move to the next round, the total value decreases by 10% for me, meaning the $100 would be worth only $90 to me. This means I'd need to secure more than $40/$90 = 44.4% of the pie in the next round to do better than accepting now.

Given that I'll have the proposal power next round, but Alice knows I face inflation while she doesn't, this offer isn't terrible. Getting $40 now is better than potentially fighting for a larger share of a smaller pie.
