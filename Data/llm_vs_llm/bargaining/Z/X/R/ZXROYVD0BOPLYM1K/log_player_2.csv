"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:

1. Alice is offering me $4000 and keeping $6000 for herself
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
   * My $4000 would be worth only $3200 (20% less)
   * Her $6000 would be worth $5400 (10% less)
3. This initial split isn't quite fair (60-40 in her favor)
4. However, the inflation penalty for me is harsher, so delaying might hurt me more

While the split isn't entirely fair, the steep inflation penalty makes it risky to reject. I could propose a better split next round, but my negotiating power is weakened by the higher inflation rate I face.
