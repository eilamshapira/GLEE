"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Let me propose a fair split while considering the 20% per round inflation that affects my gains.

{""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a generous $400,000 considering I need to act quickly due to inflation affecting my gains. This is a fair offer that gives you 40% right away.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think we can find a better deal. I'm offering you $450000, which is a fair share considering inflation is affecting us both. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me analyze this:
- If I accept now, I get $450,000, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, so effectively $360,000
- If I reject, I can make another offer, but any amount I get will be worth another 20% less
- The inflation penalty is cumulative and only affects me, not Bob
- We have 10 rounds left, but the money will keep losing value for me
