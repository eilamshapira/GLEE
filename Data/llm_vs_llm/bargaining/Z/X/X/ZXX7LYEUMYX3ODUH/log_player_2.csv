Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I propose a fair split where I receive $600,000 and you receive $400,000. This gives you a substantial portion while acknowledging that with inflation affecting me each round, I need to secure a reasonable amount now. This division allows us both to walk away with significant value rather than continuing negotiations where the total value decreases for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I propose that I receive $550,000 and you receive $450,000. This is a more generous offer to you than my previous one, acknowledging that we need to reach an agreement soon. With inflation affecting me each round, it's in both our interests to finalize this deal now rather than extending negotiations where the total value continues to decrease for me and we risk getting nothing in the end."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}

I propose an even 50-50 split where I receive $500,000 and you receive $500,000. This is a completely fair division that gives us equal shares. As we're now in round 6, inflation has significantly reduced the value of my portion. If we continue to negotiate further, we risk running out of rounds and both getting nothing. This fair split allows us both to walk away with substantial value."
