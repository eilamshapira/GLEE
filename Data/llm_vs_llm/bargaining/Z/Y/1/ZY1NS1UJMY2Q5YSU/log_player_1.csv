"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice! Let's keep it simple and fair with an even split of $50 each. This way, we both get a good share without the risk of losing more to inflation as rounds go on. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
