"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I think a 50-50 split is the fairest solution since we're both in the same situation. This way we both walk away with half a million dollars, which is a great outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
