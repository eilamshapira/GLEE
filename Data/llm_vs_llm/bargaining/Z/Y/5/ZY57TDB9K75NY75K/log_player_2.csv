"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I think this is a good starting point! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze the offer. Alice is proposing I take $400,000 while she gets $600,000, which isn't an even split.

Since there's no inflation for me, I don't lose value by continuing to the next round. This means I can potentially get a better deal by making a counter-offer. With 12 rounds available, we have plenty of time to negotiate, and I'd prefer to start with an offer that's more favorable to me.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I think a 50-50 split is the fairest solution since we're both in the same situation. This way we both walk away with half a million dollars, which is a great outcome for both of us.""}"
