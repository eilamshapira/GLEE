"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take 60, and you get 40.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is proposing a 60-40 split in her favor. Since I'm affected by 20% inflation each round, if I reject and make a counter-offer in round 2, the total value to me would be reduced to 80 dollars. 

If I were to aim for a 50-50 split in round 2, I'd be offering Alice 50 dollars while I would get 30 dollars (50% of the inflation-adjusted 80 dollars). That's worse than the current offer of 40 dollars.

Given the inflation pressure on my side, Alice's initial offer is actually reasonable.
