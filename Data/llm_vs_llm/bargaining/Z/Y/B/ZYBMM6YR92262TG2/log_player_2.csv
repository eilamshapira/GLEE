"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The current offer gives me $400,000
2. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer next round
3. However, due to 10% inflation, any amount in the next round will be worth 10% less to me
4. If I reject, my $400,000 would effectively become worth $360,000 in the next round
5. To gain more, I'd need to secure significantly more than $444,444 in the next round just to break even (because $444,444 * 0.9 = $400,000)

Given that Alice opened with a somewhat reasonable offer (40% for me), and considering the inflation penalty, it's risky to reject. The inflation makes time work against me.
