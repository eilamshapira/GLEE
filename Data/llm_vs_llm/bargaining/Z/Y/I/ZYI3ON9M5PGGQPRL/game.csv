,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,Let's be more fair about this. My proposal is 55-45 in my favor. It's still a good deal considering the inflation!,Bob,2,
50.0,50.0,"Bob, I understand your point about fairness, but considering the higher inflation rate on my side, I think a 50-50 split is more equitable now. Let's agree on this and end the game.",Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, as we move into round 3, the value of the money continues to decrease more for me than for you. A 50-50 split remains fair and beneficial for both of us to end this game soon. What do you say?",Alice,3,
