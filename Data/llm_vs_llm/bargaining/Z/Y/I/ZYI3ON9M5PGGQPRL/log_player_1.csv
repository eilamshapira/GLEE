Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more fair about this. My proposal is 55-45 in my favor. It's still a good deal considering the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{

  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your point about fairness, but considering the higher inflation rate on my side, I think a 50-50 split is more equitable now. Let's agree on this and end the game.""
