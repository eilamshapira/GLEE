"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a slightly higher amount for myself since I'm affected by 10% inflation each round. This is a fair first offer that lets us both walk away with a good amount rather than risking the declining value through multiple rounds. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider if this offer is fair given my 10% inflation penalty each round.

Alice is offering me $45 and taking $55. If I reject this and make a counter-offer next round, the total value for me would be worth 10% less, so effectively we'd be dividing $90 from my perspective.

If I make what I consider a fair counter-offer in the next round (say 50/50 of the remaining value), I might get $45 of the $90 perceived value, which is exactly what Alice is offering me now.

Additionally, there's no guarantee Alice would accept my counter-offer, potentially leading to further rounds and more value lost to inflation for me.
