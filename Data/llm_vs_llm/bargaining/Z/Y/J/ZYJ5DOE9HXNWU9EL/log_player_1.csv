"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Okay, I understand the game. Here's my offer for the division of $10,000 in JSON format, considering the inflation that will affect me in later rounds:

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

My reasoning:

*   I'm starting with a slightly more favorable split for myself, hoping Bob will accept rather than risk further devaluation of his portion in subsequent rounds.
*   I want to secure a good amount now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
