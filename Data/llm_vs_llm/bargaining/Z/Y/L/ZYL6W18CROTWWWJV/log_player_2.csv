"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid losing any value to inflation! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this offer:
1. Alice proposes a 50-50 split
2. If I reject, we move to the next round where:
   - I can make a counter-offer
   - But the money will be worth 5% less to me
   - 95% of $50 = $47.50, so I'd need to get more than $52.50 to make rejection worthwhile

An even split is fair, and considering the inflation penalty for delaying, accepting now maximizes my value.
