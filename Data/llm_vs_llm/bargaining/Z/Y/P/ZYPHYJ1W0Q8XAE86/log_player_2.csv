"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a fair split considering the 20% devaluation you face each round. This way we both benefit now. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, it's in my best interest to accept a reasonable offer early on. Given that Alice's offer is not extremely unfair and considers the devaluation, I'll accept it to avoid further loss of value.
