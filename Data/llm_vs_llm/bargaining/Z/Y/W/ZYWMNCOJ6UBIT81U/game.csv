999999.0,1.0,"Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I take $999999 and you get $1. Remember, if you reject, you'll have to wait a round and your money will lose 5% in value—while I face no such penalty. Accepting now is clearly your best option.",Alice,1,

999999.0,1.0,"Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 3: I keep $999999 and you get $1. Consider this—you know that if you reject, you’ll have to wait until Round 4, where your share will be discounted even further (down to about 85.7% of its nominal value), and I, as the proposer in Round 5, could then claim nearly the entire amount. In effect, your future payoff would be nothing. Accepting this offer now gives you a strictly positive amount (about $0.90 in today’s value), so it’s in your best interest to agree.",Alice,3,

900000.0,100000.0,"Alice, I'm willing to be flexible, but this offer is my bottom line.  You receive the lion's share, but I need a reasonable amount to make this worthwhile.  Continuing this standoff hurts us both.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, while your offer gives me $900000 right now, by rejecting I secure the opportunity to propose in the next round where I can claim nearly the full amount. Since my money isn’t subjected to inflation and I can leverage future proposals to my advantage, it’s in my best interest to hold out for a better division. I therefore must reject your offer.",Alice,4,reject
50000.0,950000.0,"Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 5: I’m offering me $50000 and you $950000. Remember, your money in this round is worth about 81.45% of its nominal value. If you reject my offer, you'll become the proposer in Round 6—but then your money will be discounted at roughly 77.38% of its nominal amount, and I can then claim almost the entire pie. In essence, by accepting now, you secure a discounted value of approximately 950000 × 0.8145 ≈ 773780 in today’s terms, which is as much as you could expect by waiting. I believe this is a fair and strategically sound offer. Please consider accepting.",Alice,5,
