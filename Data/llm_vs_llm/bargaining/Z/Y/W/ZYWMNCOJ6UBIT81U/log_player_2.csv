"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here's my proposal: I take $999999 and you get $1. Remember, if you reject, you'll have to wait a round and your money will lose 5% in value—while I face no such penalty. Accepting now is clearly your best option.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 3: I keep $999999 and you get $1. Consider this—you know that if you reject, you’ll have to wait until Round 4, where your share will be discounted even further (down to about 85.7% of its nominal value), and I, as the proposer in Round 5, could then claim nearly the entire amount. In effect, your future payoff would be nothing. Accepting this offer now gives you a strictly positive amount (about $0.90 in today’s value), so it’s in your best interest to agree. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is employing the same tactic, hoping I'll panic as the devaluation progresses.  It's a waiting game now. I need to see if she'll budge from her extreme position."

Round 4

{
""bob_gain"": 100000,
""alice_gain"": 900000,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, here’s my proposal for Round 5: I’m offering me $50000 and you $950000. Remember, your money in this round is worth about 81.45% of its nominal value. If you reject my offer, you'll become the proposer in Round 6—but then your money will be discounted at roughly 77.38% of its nominal amount, and I can then claim almost the entire pie. In essence, by accepting now, you secure a discounted value of approximately 950000 × 0.8145 ≈ 773780 in today’s terms, which is as much as you could expect by waiting. I believe this is a fair and strategically sound offer. Please consider accepting. 
# Bob gain: 950000 
# Alice gain: 50000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This offer, while not ideal, is the best I'm likely to get at this point. Accepting now locks in a significant gain, even with the accumulated inflation, and avoids the risk of getting even less in subsequent rounds."
