"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me consider this offer. Alice is proposing to give me $4,000 out of the $10,000, while she takes $6,000.

If I reject this offer, I'll get to make a counter-offer in the next round, but due to inflation, the total amount will effectively be worth 5% less to me. This means the $10,000 would be worth $9,500 to me in the next round.

While Alice's offer gives me less than half of the total amount, it's a substantial sum. If I reject and we continue negotiating, inflation could reduce my potential gain further if negotiations extend multiple rounds.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counter-offer that's more balanced while accounting for the inflation I face.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I propose an even 50-50 split of the money. This is a fair division that gives us both equal shares of the total amount. Since I'm facing 5% inflation with each round, it's important we reach an agreement efficiently, and an equal split represents a fair compromise."
