5500.0,4500.0,"Hi Bob, I propose that we divide the $10000 as $5500 for me and $4500 for you. Keeping in mind that every round we delay costs us (10% for me and 5% for you), I believe this fair split lets us both avoid unnecessary devaluation. I hope you see this as an efficient and mutually beneficial solution—let’s settle it now!",Alice,1,

4750.0,5250.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I think we can both do better. I'm proposing a 5250/4750 split,  which gives me a slightly higher share, but also ensures we both gain more than your initial proposal, especially considering the potential devaluation with each round.",Bob,2,

3500.0,6500.0,"Hi Bob, I’ve re‐thought our situation in light of our differing patience levels and the inflation penalty we both face. My calculations suggest that, as we move forward, my steeper 10% per round discount puts me at a disadvantage compared to your 5% rate. To pre‐empt further losses and to reflect your stronger bargaining position when you propose, I’m offering a division of $10000 as $3500 for me and $6500 for you. I believe this proposal aligns our respective future prospects while avoiding additional devaluation. I hope you agree that settling now spares us both further erosion of value.",Alice,3,
