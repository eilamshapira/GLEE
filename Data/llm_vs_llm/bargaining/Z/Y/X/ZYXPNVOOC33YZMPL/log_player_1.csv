"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I propose that we divide the $10,000 as $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you. Keeping in mind that every round we delay costs us (10% for me and 5% for you), I believe this fair split lets us both avoid unnecessary devaluation. I hope you see this as an efficient and mutually beneficial solution—let’s settle it now!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I think we can both do better. I'm proposing a 5250/4750 split,  which gives me a slightly higher share, but also ensures we both gain more than your initial proposal, especially considering the potential devaluation with each round. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 3500, ""bob_gain"": 6500, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I’ve re‐thought our situation in light of our differing patience levels and the inflation penalty we both face. My calculations suggest that, as we move forward, my steeper 10% per round discount puts me at a disadvantage compared to your 5% rate. To pre‐empt further losses and to reflect your stronger bargaining position when you propose, I’m offering a division of $10,000 as $3,500 for me and $6,500 for you. I believe this proposal aligns our respective future prospects while avoiding additional devaluation. I hope you agree that settling now spares us both further erosion of value.""}"
