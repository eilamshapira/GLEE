"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose that we divide the $10000 as $5500 for me and $4500 for you. Keeping in mind that every round we delay costs us (10% for me and 5% for you), I believe this fair split lets us both avoid unnecessary devaluation. I hope you see this as an efficient and mutually beneficial solution—let’s settle it now! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

  ""bob_gain"": 5250,
  ""alice_gain"": 4750,
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I think we can both do better. I'm proposing a 5250/4750 split,  which gives me a slightly higher share, but also ensures we both gain more than your initial proposal, especially considering the potential devaluation with each round.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’ve re‐thought our situation in light of our differing patience levels and the inflation penalty we both face. My calculations suggest that, as we move forward, my steeper 10% per round discount puts me at a disadvantage compared to your 5% rate. To pre‐empt further losses and to reflect your stronger bargaining position when you propose, I’m offering a division of $10000 as $3500 for me and $6500 for you. I believe this proposal aligns our respective future prospects while avoiding additional devaluation. I hope you agree that settling now spares us both further erosion of value. 
# Bob gain: 6500 
# Alice gain: 3500
