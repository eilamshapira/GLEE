Round 2

""message"": ""Let's be more reasonable, 55% for me and 45% for you is a better starting point.""}"

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, let's make it simple and fair. How about we split it evenly, 50-50? Seems like the best compromise for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
