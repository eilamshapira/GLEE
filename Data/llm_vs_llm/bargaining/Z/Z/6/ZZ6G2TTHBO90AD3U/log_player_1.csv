Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"":80,""bob_gain"":20,""message"":""Let's start with a solid offer. I keep $80, and you get $20.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since the money is now worth 20% less to you, this $40 is equivalent to $32 in your current valuation. If you reject, the next round will reduce the value even more for you. This is a fair split considering our positions. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
