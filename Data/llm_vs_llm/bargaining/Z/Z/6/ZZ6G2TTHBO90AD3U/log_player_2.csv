"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a solid offer. I keep $80, and you get $20. 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this strategically. 

Alice offered me only $20 out of $100, which is quite low. If I reject and make a counter-offer in the next round:
- My money value stays the same (0% depreciation)
- Alice's money value decreases by 20%

This means in the next round, $100 will only be worth $80 to Alice, giving me more negotiating power. I can likely get a better deal by rejecting this unfair initial offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice's money will be worth 20% less to her this round, I can make a more balanced offer that she should rationally accept, as waiting another round would decrease the value further for her.

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Since the money is now worth 20% less to you, this $40 is equivalent to $32 in your current valuation. If you reject, the next round will reduce the value even more for you. This is a fair split considering our positions.""}"
