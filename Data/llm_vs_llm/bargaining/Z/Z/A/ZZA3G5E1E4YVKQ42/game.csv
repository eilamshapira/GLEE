6000.0,4000.0,"Let's split it fairly, but with a slight edge for me to account for inflation in future rounds if we don't agree now. 60/40 is a good deal!",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Considering the impact of inflation on your share, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is fair given the decreasing value for you each round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5250.0,4750.0,"Okay Bob, let's try to reach a compromise. I'll take 52.5% which after the 5% loss is roughly equivalent to 5000$. This is my best offer.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4250.0,5750.0,"Given the increasing impact of inflation on your share, I'm proposing a 57.5/42.5 split. This accounts for the significant decrease in value you're facing and still offers you a reasonable amount.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is my final offer. A straight 50/50 split. We're losing money by not agreeing. Take it or leave it.",Alice,5,
