"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 9900 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Alice is proposing to give me only $100 out of $10,000, which is just 1% of the total amount, this offer seems very unfair. If I reject, I'll have a chance to make my own proposal next round, though the money will be worth 20% less to me. Still, I could propose a much more equitable split that would give me significantly more than $100.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll propose a more balanced split that acknowledges the inflation penalty I'm facing while still being fair to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing an equal split of the $10,000. While I've already lost 20% of the value due to inflation, a 50/50 split is fair and reasonable. This gives us both $5,000, which I hope Alice will find acceptable so we can conclude this negotiation without further devaluation of the money."
