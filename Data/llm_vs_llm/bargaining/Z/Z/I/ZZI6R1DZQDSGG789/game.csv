55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 55/45 split in my favor because if we delay, we both lose value due to inflation, but you lose more (10% vs my 5%). This is a fair first offer that recognizes the inflation pressure affects you more significantly.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, let's split the $100 evenly at 50/50. This way, we both share equally, and we mitigate the loss from inflation fairly for both parties.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
52.5,47.5,"Bob, I appreciate your even split offer, but we need to consider that inflation affects you more (10%) than me (5%) each round. If we continue to the next round, you'll lose more value. This 52.5/47.5 split is actually fair when accounting for our different inflation rates - it gives us both approximately equal value after inflation compared to earlier rounds. Let's conclude this now to avoid further value loss for both of us.",Alice,3,
