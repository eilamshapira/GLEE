"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a fair offer while considering the inflation that affects both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 55/45 split in my favor because if we delay, we both lose value due to inflation, but you lose more (10% vs my 5%). This is a fair first offer that recognizes the inflation pressure affects you more significantly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split the $100 evenly at 50/50. This way, we both share equally, and we mitigate the loss from inflation fairly for both parties. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I need to account for the continued inflation effects while making my next offer.

{""alice_gain"": 52.5,
""bob_gain"": 47.5,
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your even split offer, but we need to consider that inflation affects you more (10%) than me (5%) each round. If we continue to the next round, you'll lose more value. This 52.5/47.5 split is actually fair when accounting for our different inflation rates - it gives us both approximately equal value after inflation compared to earlier rounds. Let's conclude this now to avoid further value loss for both of us.""}"
