"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm suggesting a 55/45 split in my favor because if we delay, we both lose value due to inflation, but you lose more (10% vs my 5%). This is a fair first offer that recognizes the inflation pressure affects you more significantly. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's split the $100 evenly at 50/50. This way, we both share equally, and we mitigate the loss from inflation fairly for both parties.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your even split offer, but we need to consider that inflation affects you more (10%) than me (5%) each round. If we continue to the next round, you'll lose more value. This 52.5/47.5 split is actually fair when accounting for our different inflation rates - it gives us both approximately equal value after inflation compared to earlier rounds. Let's conclude this now to avoid further value loss for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 47.5 
# Alice gain: 52.5 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
