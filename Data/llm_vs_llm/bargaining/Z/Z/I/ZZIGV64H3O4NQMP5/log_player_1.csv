"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, 
""bob_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""Hi Bob! I suggest a 60-40 split in my favor. This is fair because if you reject, the money will be worth less to me in the next round due to inflation, while its value stays the same for you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, let's keep things simple and split the money evenly. A 50/50 split seems fair. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me think about this:
- If I accept now, I get $5000, but due to 20% inflation, it's worth $4000 to me
- If I reject and make a counter-offer, any money I get will be worth another 20% less
- Bob is not affected by inflation, so he has a stronger negotiating position as rounds go by
- Getting $4000 in value now is better than risking further devaluation
