100.0,9900.0,Hi Bob. To avoid further loss from inflation on my side—and since I know you might not be affected—I’m offering you nearly the entire $10000 if we agree now. I take just $100. Let’s settle immediately so you get your full benefit and we both avoid delay.,Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Let's be fair, Alice. I'm proposing a 60/40 split.  No need for games, let's wrap this up.",Bob,2,

4000.0,6000.0,"Hi Bob, I know that with each extra round I’m taking a hit—my share is now worth 10% less than in round 1—so delaying further hurts me more. To avoid any further loss for both of us, I’m proposing a direct settlement: I get $4000 and you get $6000. This is in line with your previous 60/40 thinking and guarantees that you won’t lose out in real value either. Let’s wrap this up now before inflation bites us any harder.",Alice,3,
