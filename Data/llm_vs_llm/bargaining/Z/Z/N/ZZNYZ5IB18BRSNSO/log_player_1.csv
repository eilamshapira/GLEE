"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 100, ""bob_gain"": 9900, ""message"": ""Hi Bob. To avoid further loss from inflation on my side—and since I know you might not be affected—I’m offering you nearly the entire $10,000 if we agree now. I take just $100. Let’s settle immediately so you get your full benefit and we both avoid delay.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. I'm proposing a 60/40 split.  No need for games, let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I know that with each extra round I’m taking a hit—my share is now worth 10% less than in round 1—so delaying further hurts me more. To avoid any further loss for both of us, I’m proposing a direct settlement: I get $4000 and you get $6000. This is in line with your previous 60/40 thinking and guarantees that you won’t lose out in real value either. Let’s wrap this up now before inflation bites us any harder.""}"
