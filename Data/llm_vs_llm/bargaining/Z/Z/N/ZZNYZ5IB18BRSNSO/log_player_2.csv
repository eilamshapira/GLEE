"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob. To avoid further loss from inflation on my side—and since I know you might not be affected—I’m offering you nearly the entire $10000 if we agree now. I take just $100. Let’s settle immediately so you get your full benefit and we both avoid delay. 
# Bob gain: 9900 
# Alice gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Alice's offer seems very generous on the surface, it's highly suspicious. Her language strongly suggests that I am affected by inflation while she might not be. This asymmetry is a major red flag. It's very likely she knows about the inflation affecting me and is trying to exploit that. 

It's worth risking a round to see if I can get a more equitable split."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice. I'm proposing a 60/40 split.  No need for games, let's wrap this up.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I know that with each extra round I’m taking a hit—my share is now worth 10% less than in round 1—so delaying further hurts me more. To avoid any further loss for both of us, I’m proposing a direct settlement: I get $4000 and you get $6000. This is in line with your previous 60/40 thinking and guarantees that you won’t lose out in real value either. Let’s wrap this up now before inflation bites us any harder. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice has now claimed to be negatively impacted by inflation, though at a lower rate than what I'm experiencing. Her offer remains the same as my previous one, and while it's not ideal, accepting guarantees a reasonable share before inflation erodes it further.  

It's important to note that I have no way to verify Alice's claims about her own inflation rate. However, accepting this offer averts the risk of getting a much smaller share in future rounds if her claims are true."
