"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""message"": ""Fair share, let's end quickly""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly for fairness. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, the actual values would be:
Alice gain: 400000 (500000 * 0.8)
Bob gain: 400000 (500000 * 0.8)

Considering this, I think an even split is reasonable, especially since the value will decrease further in the next round.
