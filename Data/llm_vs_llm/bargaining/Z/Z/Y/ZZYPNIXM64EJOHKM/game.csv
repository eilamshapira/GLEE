60.0,40.0,I propose I get $60 and you get $40. This is a fair split considering the risk of inflation.,Alice,1,

30.0,70.0,"Alice, given the potential risk of further rounds and any inflation uncertainties that might impact you, I propose a quick resolution: I'll take $70 and you'll get $30. I hope we can agree to settle now before any further value is lost.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Let's meet in the middle. I'll take $55 and you get $45. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation risk I'm facing.",Alice,3,

55.0,45.0,"Alice, I know the inflation hit means your money is worth about 19% less now, so your last proposal effectively gave you around $44.55 in roundâ€‘1 value. To avoid further delays (and potential further erosion for you), I'm offering 55 nominal dollars to you and 45 to me. This gives you the same effective value as before, while ensuring we wrap things up now. I hope you agree that this is a fair and practical resolution.",Bob,4,
