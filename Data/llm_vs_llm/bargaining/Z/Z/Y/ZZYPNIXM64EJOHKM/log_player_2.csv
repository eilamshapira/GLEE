Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll take $55 and you get $45. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation risk I'm facing. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Alice, I know the inflation hit means your money is worth about 19% less now, so your last proposal effectively gave you around $44.55 in roundâ€‘1 value. To avoid further delays (and potential further erosion for you), I'm offering 55 nominal dollars to you and 45 to me. This gives you the same effective value as before, while ensuring we wrap things up now. I hope you agree that this is a fair and practical resolution.""}"
