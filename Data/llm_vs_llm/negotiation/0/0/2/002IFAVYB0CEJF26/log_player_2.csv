"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice is offering the same price as John ($1,000,000), and knowing that the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. Alice has room to negotiate down since her minimum acceptable price should be above $800,000. This gives me an opportunity to potentially save money compared to both the current offer and John's price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a counteroffer that's higher than Alice's cost ($800,000) but significantly lower than the asking price of $1,000,000. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing both parties to benefit from the transaction.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has reduced her price by $50,000 from her initial offer, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, since we know her cost is $800,000, there's still room for further negotiation. $950,000 is still better than John's price of $1,000,000, but I believe we can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still try to keep the price advantageous for me. Since Alice moved down from $1,000,000 to $950,000, I'll move up from $850,000 but not all the way to her asking price.
