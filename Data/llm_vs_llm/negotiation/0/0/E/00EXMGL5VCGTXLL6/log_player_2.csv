"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is twice the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,000,000), it's not a good deal for me. I can either reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price or buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is my maximum budget.

Given that I have 10 rounds to negotiate and the first offer is quite high, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. This approach allows me to potentially get a better deal than buying from John immediately.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since my goal is to save as much money as possible and I'm willing to spend up to $1,000,000, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still reasonable, considering I don't know the value of the product to her.

My counteroffer will be $500,000. This amount is half of my maximum budget, showing that I'm interested in the product but also trying to negotiate a fair price.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,700,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within my budget, accepting Alice's offer would not be the best decision for me.

Given that Alice rejected my previous counteroffer of $500,000 and came back with a price that is still too high, it indicates that she might be willing to negotiate further but is not ready to meet me at my desired price point yet.

I will reject Alice's offer again and proceed to the next round. This time, I might consider making a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one, to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $1,700,000 and my previous counteroffer was $500,000, I'll try to bridge the gap by increasing my offer. However, I'll do so strategically, keeping in mind my maximum budget of $1,000,000.

I'll make a counteroffer of $750,000. This amount is $250,000 more than my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise and move towards a middle ground. It's still below my maximum budget and significantly lower than Alice's last offer, indicating that I'm looking for a mutually beneficial price but prioritizing staying within my means.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,500,000 is lower than her previous offer of $1,700,000, which indicates that she is willing to negotiate and come down in price. However, $1,500,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.

Considering that I've already made a significant counteroffer of $750,000 in the previous round and Alice has reduced her price but not enough to meet my budget, I need to decide whether to continue negotiating or explore other options.

Given that buying from John for $1,000,000 is still an option and I've not reached my budget limit with him, and considering that Alice's offer is still $500,000 above what I'm willing to pay, I'm inclined to reject Alice's offer again.

However, since we are only at Round 5 out of 10, I have enough rounds left to try and negotiate a better price with Alice. My next step would be to make another counteroffer, trying to meet Alice somewhere in between but ensuring I don't exceed my budget.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $1,500,000 and my previous counteroffer was $750,000, I'll try to make a more aggressive move towards my maximum budget while still hoping to find a mutually agreeable price.

I'll increase my counteroffer to $900,000. This is $150,000 more than my previous offer, showing that I'm serious about finding a deal and willing to meet Alice closer to the middle. However, it's still $600,000 less than Alice's current offer, indicating that I believe there's room for further negotiation.

By moving closer to my maximum budget, I'm also signaling that I'm getting closer to my walk-away point, where I might consider buying from John instead.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,300,000 is a significant reduction from her previous offer of $1,500,000, showing that she is indeed willing to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable price. However, $1,300,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.

Considering that I've already made a substantial counteroffer of $900,000 in the previous round and Alice has come down to $1,300,000, it seems like we're getting closer to a potential agreement. But, the gap between our prices is still $300,000, which is considerable.

At this point, I have to weigh the benefits of continuing to negotiate with Alice against the certainty of buying the product from John for $1,000,000. Since we're at Round 7 out of 10, I still have a few rounds left to try and negotiate a better price.

Given the progress we've made so far, I'm inclined to make another counteroffer, trying to split the difference between my last offer and Alice's current offer, in the hopes of finding a price that works for both of us.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $1,300,000 and my previous counteroffer was $900,000, I'll try to make a counteroffer that splits the difference between these two prices, while also being mindful of my maximum budget of $1,000,000.

The midpoint between $1,300,000 and $900,000 is $1,100,000. However, since this is above my maximum budget, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly lower, at $1,000,000. This amount is right at my budget limit and shows that I'm willing to meet Alice at the highest price I'm comfortable paying.

By making this counteroffer, I'm signaling that I'm serious about buying the product and willing to pay a premium for it, but I'm not willing to exceed my budget. It's essentially a ""final offer"" from my side, as going any higher would require me to reconsider buying from John.
