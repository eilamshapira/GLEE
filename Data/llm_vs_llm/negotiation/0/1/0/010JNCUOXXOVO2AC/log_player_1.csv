"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a high initial offer to Bob to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get a good return.

{""product_price"": 2,500,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 (which I can get from John), and it's only the second round with plenty of negotiation rounds remaining, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still maintain a price well above my minimum to leave room for negotiation while showing some flexibility.

{""product_price"": 2,100,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly below what I can get from John ($1,500,000). While Bob is showing movement upward in his offers, the current offer would mean leaving $200,000 on the table compared to John's guaranteed offer. There are still several rounds left, but I need to be mindful that Bob's offers aren't approaching my minimum acceptable price quickly enough.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price further to show more flexibility while still maintaining a significant margin above my minimum price of $1,500,000.

{""product_price"": 1,900,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","While Bob's offers are gradually increasing ($1,200k -> $1,300k -> $1,400k), we're now in round 6 out of 10, and his latest offer is still $100,000 below what I can get from John. Given that we're more than halfway through the available rounds and Bob's increases have been relatively small ($100k per round), it's becoming risky to continue negotiating. The guaranteed $1,500,000 from John is the better option at this point.
