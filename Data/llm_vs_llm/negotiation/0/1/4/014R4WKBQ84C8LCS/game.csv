"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I value the product, but I'm only willing to pay $650000. Please let me know if this is something you'd consider.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, however $650000 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value, and I have another buyer (John) who is willing to pay $800000. Given the quality and value of the product, I can come down to $950000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial offer. How does this sound?",950000.0,Alice,3,
