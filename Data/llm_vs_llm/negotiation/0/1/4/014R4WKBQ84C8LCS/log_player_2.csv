Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, however $650000 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value, and I have another buyer (John) who is willing to pay $800000. Given the quality and value of the product, I can come down to $950000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial offer. How does this sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
