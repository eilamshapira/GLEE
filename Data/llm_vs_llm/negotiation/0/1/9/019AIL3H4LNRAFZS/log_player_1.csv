{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find very valuable. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $9500 is quite steep. Given that the product is worth $8000 to you, I'd like to propose a more balanced price of $8500, which would give you a $500 profit while still being fair to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
