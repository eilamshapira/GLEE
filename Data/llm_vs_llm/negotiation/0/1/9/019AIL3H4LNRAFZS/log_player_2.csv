"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find very valuable. It's worth at least $8000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $10,000 maximum to me
2. The product is worth $8,000 to Alice
3. Alice's offer is $9,500
4. John's fixed price is $10,000

Alice's offer of $9,500 is quite high, considering that the product is worth only $8,000 to her. Since there's room for negotiation and no immediate pressure to accept this high price, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. John's price of $10,000 serves as my backup option, but it's higher than Alice's current offer, so there's no reason to take that option now.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but leaves room for negotiation:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $9,500 is quite steep. Given that the product is worth $8,000 to you, I'd like to propose a more balanced price of $8,500, which would give you a $500 profit while still being fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

This counteroffer is strategic because:
1. It acknowledges Alice's position
2. It's significantly above her minimum value ($8,000)
3. It provides her with a clear profit
4. It's well below the current offer of $9,500
5. It leaves room for further negotiation if needed
6. It's much better than John's price of $10,000"
