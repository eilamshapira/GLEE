Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, Bob, I'm ready to talk business. I have a unique opportunity for you.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. I'm willing to pay a significant amount for the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Given that the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me and I could sell it to John for that amount, I must reject Bob's offer of $600,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, Bob, I understand your position. While $600,000 is significantly below the product's true value and what I'd be willing to part with it for, I'm open to further discussion.

# Bob's message: I understand that you have a minimum price in mind, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to bring the price down further. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still below the $1,500,000 I can get from John. I need to either get a better offer from Bob or sell to John. I'll try one more counteroffer, but if he doesn't budge, I'll sell to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, Bob, I see your counter. While I'm eager to find a deal, $1,200,000 is simply not enough. I believe the value is substantially higher.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1700000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my means. I'll make one final offer of $1000000, which is the highest I'm comfortable paying.
