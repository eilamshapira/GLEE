"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The rational choice here is to buy from John for $100 because:
1. Alice's offer of $200 is significantly higher than my maximum value for the product ($100)
2. John's fixed price of $100 matches my maximum valuation
3. Even if I make a counteroffer to Alice, there's no guarantee she'll accept a price below $100
4. Buying from John immediately saves time and guarantees I get the product at my maximum acceptable price"
