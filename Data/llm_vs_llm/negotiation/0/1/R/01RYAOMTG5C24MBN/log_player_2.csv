"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Based on the information provided, Alice's offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than the alternative option of buying from John for $12,000. Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me (Bob), and John is willing to sell at exactly that price, there's no reason to accept Alice's much higher offer.

I could try to negotiate with Alice, but her initial offer is more than double John's price, suggesting she might not come down to a competitive level. Given that I can guarantee the product at my maximum value, the rational decision is:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
