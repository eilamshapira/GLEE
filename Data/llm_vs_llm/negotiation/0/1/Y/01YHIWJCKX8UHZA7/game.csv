"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $950000 is quite high given market conditions. I know this product is valuable, but I can get a similar one elsewhere for less. I'm willing to pay $850000, which would still give you a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, and I'm glad to hear you're interested in the product. I'm willing to negotiate, but given the value this product will bring to you, I believe $920000 is a fair price for both of us. Let's find a way that works best for both parties.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for working with me on the price, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $920000, but that's still quite high for me. Since you've moved $30000 from your initial offer, I'm also willing to move up from my initial position. I can offer you $875000, which gives you a solid profit while staying within my budget constraints. This seems like a fair middle ground for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
