Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $160 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know the product is available elsewhere for $120, so I'd be happy to buy it from you for $100. This gives you a quick sale and saves me the hassle of going elsewhere. What do you think?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I know I can get this exact product from John for $120, and that's really the maximum I'm willing to pay. To save myself the trouble of going to another seller, I can offer you $110, which would be a win for both of us. What do you say?
