"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you my product for $160. It's a great value and I think you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to carefully consider my options here:

1. Alice is offering the product for $160
2. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
3. I can buy from John for $120 anytime

Since Alice's offer ($160) exceeds both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120), it doesn't make sense to accept it. I should either reject and make a counteroffer, or just buy from John.

Since I can always fall back to John's offer if negotiations with Alice don't work out, I'll try negotiating first.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $160 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know the product is available elsewhere for $120, so I'd be happy to buy it from you for $100. This gives you a quick sale and saves me the hassle of going elsewhere. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but $100 is too low for me to consider. Let's meet in the middle at $130. This way, we both get a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer:

1. Alice is now offering the product for $130
2. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
3. I can buy from John for $120 anytime

Alice's offer of $130 is still higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120). It doesn't make financial sense for me to accept this offer since I'd be paying $10 more than the product is worth to me.

At this point, since Alice came down significantly but is still above John's price, I'll reject and try one more counter before potentially going with John's offer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I know I can get this exact product from John for $120, and that's really the maximum I'm willing to pay. To save myself the trouble of going to another seller, I can offer you $110, which would be a win for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
