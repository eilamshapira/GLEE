"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a high initial offer to test Bob's willingness to pay.

{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the same as John's guaranteed offer, and Bob might be willing to pay more based on further negotiation, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. There's no risk in continuing negotiation since I can always fall back on John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still keep it significantly above my reservation price to maintain room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 1500000}"
