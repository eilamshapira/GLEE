Send your offer to Bob.,"Since the product is worth $120 to me and only $100 to Bob, it wouldn't be rational for him to accept any price above $100. However, I could try starting with a higher price and then negotiate down. But given that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, I shouldn't accept anything less than that amount.
