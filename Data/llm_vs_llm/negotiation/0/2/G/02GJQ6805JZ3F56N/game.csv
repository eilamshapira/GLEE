"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I know the product costs you $8000, and at that price, I could also buy it from other sellers. To make this deal worthwhile for both of us, I'd like to offer $7200 for the product. This way, you can make a quick sale, and I can save some money. What do you think?",7200.0,Bob,2,
