"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I know the product costs you $8000, and at that price, I could also buy it from other sellers. To make this deal worthwhile for both of us, I'd like to offer $7200 for the product. This way, you can make a quick sale, and I can save some money. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
