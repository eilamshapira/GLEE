"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I am offering you the product for $8000. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The rational decision here is to reject Alice's offer since:

1. The product is worth $8,000 to Alice (her cost)
2. She's offering it at $8,000 (no profit margin for negotiation)
3. John's price ($8,000) serves as a backup option
4. By rejecting and making a counteroffer, I can try to negotiate a lower price
5. If negotiations fail, I can still buy from John at $8,000, so there's no risk in trying to negotiate

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price, knowing I can always fall back on John's $8,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I know the product costs you $8,000, and at that price, I could also buy it from other sellers. To make this deal worthwhile for both of us, I'd like to offer $7,200 for the product. This way, you can make a quick sale, and I can save some money. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7200}

I chose $7,200 because:
1. It's a 10% reduction from the asking price
2. It leaves room for negotiation
3. It's significantly better than the $8,000 alternative from John
4. It's a reasonable starting point that isn't so low as to be offensive
5. Even if Alice counter-offers higher, we have room to meet in the middle"
