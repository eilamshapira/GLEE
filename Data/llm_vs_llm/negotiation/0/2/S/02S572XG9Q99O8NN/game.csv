"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is too low for this product. I know its true value in the market, and I cannot go below $13500. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $13500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $10500. This is a fair middle ground, and I hope you can consider it.",10500.0,Bob,4,
