"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I was looking to spend no more than $10000 for this product. Would you be willing to accept this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $10,000 is too low considering my minimum acceptable price is $12,000, and I know Bob values the product at $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for this product. I know its true value in the market, and I cannot go below $13,500. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $13500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $10500. This is a fair middle ground, and I hope you can consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $12,000. Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and given that he's only increased his offer by $500, it seems unlikely we'll reach a price above $12,000. It's better to secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John rather than continue negotiating with Bob."
