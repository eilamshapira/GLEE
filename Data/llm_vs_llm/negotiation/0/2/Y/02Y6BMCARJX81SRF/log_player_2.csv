"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price offered by Alice ($15,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative offer ($8,000). It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer to Alice. If we can't reach a better deal with Alice, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6000}

I'll offer $6,000 to Alice. This is below John's price of $8,000, which gives me room to negotiate upward if needed while still potentially saving money compared to John's offer. If Alice rejects this and counters with a price above $8,000, I can always go with John's offer instead."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $14,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative offer ($8,000). While Alice has reduced the price from her initial offer, it's still not competitive. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. If Alice continues to stay significantly above $8,000, I can always take John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7000}

I'll increase my offer to $7,000. This is still below John's price of $8,000, giving me room to potentially save money while also showing some movement toward meeting Alice in the middle. It's a more substantial offer than my previous one, which might help move the negotiation forward. If Alice still insists on a price above $8,000, I can always take John's offer."
