"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product sounds interesting, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. Considering I can get something similar from John for $10000, I'm willing to offer $8000. Would you consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $8000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. As you mentioned John's price of $10000, you can understand that's my baseline. However, I believe my product offers superior value, which is why I'm willing to adjust my initial offer. I can offer it to you for $15000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects the true value of the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks Alice, I appreciate the revised offer. While I see the value, $15000 is still a bit high for me. I'm more comfortable in the $9000 range.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",9000.0,Bob,4,
