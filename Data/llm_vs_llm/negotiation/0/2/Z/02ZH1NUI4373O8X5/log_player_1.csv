"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18,500. This is a competitive price for the product's specifications and worth."", ""product_price"": 18500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product sounds interesting, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. Considering I can get something similar from John for $10000, I'm willing to offer $8000. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and it's even lower than John's guaranteed offer. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but I'll adjust my price downward to show some flexibility while maintaining a profitable position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $8,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. As you mentioned John's price of $10,000, you can understand that's my baseline. However, I believe my product offers superior value, which is why I'm willing to adjust my initial offer. I can offer it to you for $15,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, I appreciate the revised offer. While I see the value, $15000 is still a bit high for me. I'm more comfortable in the $9000 range.  Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $10,000. Bob's offers have consistently been below John's guaranteed price of $10,000, and his latest offer of $9,000 is still below that. Since we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and Bob seems unwilling to exceed $10,000, it makes more business sense to take John's guaranteed offer rather than continue negotiations that might not lead to a better outcome."
