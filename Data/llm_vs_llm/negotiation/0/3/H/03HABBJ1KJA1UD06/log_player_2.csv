"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $15,000
2. Alice's offer is $12,000, which is $3,000 less than John's price
3. I have 10 rounds of negotiation available
4. I can potentially get an even better deal by negotiating

Given that Alice's initial offer is already significantly lower than my maximum value and John's price, it might be tempting to accept. However, first offers in negotiations typically have room for improvement. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get an even better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice offered $12,000, I'll try to negotiate for a lower price. A common negotiation strategy is to start lower than your target price. Given that Alice's initial offer was $12,000, I'll make a significantly lower counteroffer to create room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 8000}

This counteroffer of $8,000 is:
1. Low enough to leave room for negotiation
2. Not so low as to be considered unreasonable or offensive
3. Creates a midpoint between my offer and Alice's initial offer that would still be favorable to me

If Alice rejects this, we can potentially meet somewhere in the middle, which would still be better than both her initial offer of $12,000 and John's price of $15,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $12,000 to $11,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. The new price is $4,000 less than John's price
3. We still have 7 more rounds of negotiation possible
4. The movement from $12,000 to $11,000 ($1,000 reduction) suggests there might still be room for negotiation

While $11,000 is a good price, the fact that Alice reduced her price by $1,000 suggests there might be more flexibility. I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer to see if we can get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down from $12,000 to $11,000, showing a $1,000 reduction, I'll also adjust my previous offer upward from $8,000 to show good faith in the negotiation. I'll aim for a price point that splits the difference somewhat between our positions but still leaves room for further negotiation.

{""product_price"": 9500}

This counteroffer of $9,500:
1. Shows meaningful movement from my previous offer of $8,000
2. Splits the difference between our positions more evenly
3. Still leaves room for negotiation while being a reasonable price
4. Demonstrates that I'm willing to be flexible while still seeking a good deal

If Alice rejects this, we might be able to meet around $10,000-$10,500, which would still be an excellent price compared to John's $15,000."
