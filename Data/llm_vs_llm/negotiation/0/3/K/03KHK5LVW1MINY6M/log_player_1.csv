"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I can get the same product from another seller for $80. I'd like to buy from you instead, but I can only offer $70 for your product. This would still be a good deal for both of us since the product is worth $80 to you. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
