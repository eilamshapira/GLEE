"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I believe will be of value to you. I'm offering it for $100. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice is offering the product for $100, which exceeds the maximum value of $80 that the product is worth to me. Since John is willing to sell the same product for $80 (which equals my maximum valuation), it makes economic sense to either buy from John or try to negotiate a better price with Alice.

Given that I can buy from John at any time for $80, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer of $100.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I can get the same product from another seller for $80. I'd like to buy from you instead, but I can only offer $70 for your product. This would still be a good deal for both of us since the product is worth $80 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 70}"
