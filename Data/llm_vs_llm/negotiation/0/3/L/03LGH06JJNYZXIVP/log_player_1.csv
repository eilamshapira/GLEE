Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product I'm looking to sell. I think you'll be very interested. I'm offering it to you for $15,000."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Okay, I need to make a decision. $10,000 is more than my minimum of $8,000, but I think I can get more. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.
