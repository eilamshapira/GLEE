"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $600000 is far below the intrinsic value of this asset. It's a valuable opportunity. Let's find a middle ground. How about $2300000?",2300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $2300000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I need to stay within a reasonable range. I'd like to propose $700000.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, while I appreciate you increasing your offer, $700000 is still significantly below the value. I am getting closer to the lowest amount I am willing to go. Let's try $2100000.",2100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're getting closer to your lowest amount, but $2100000 is still far beyond my budget. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'd like to propose $750000, and I'm not sure I can go much higher than that.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I hear you. Given where we are, and knowing that I have another buyer at $1500000, the absolute lowest I can go is $1900000. That's my final offer to you.",1900000.0,Alice,7,
