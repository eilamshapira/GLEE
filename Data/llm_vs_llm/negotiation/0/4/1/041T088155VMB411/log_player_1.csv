Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will benefit you greatly. I'm asking for $1,000,000.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the potential profit.
* **Value emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob aims to justify the high price and potentially sway him towards acceptance even with limited negotiation. 
* **Open to discussion:**  The phrase ""discuss further"" implies flexibility and willingness to negotiate, which can be helpful in securing a deal.

By starting high and emphasizing the product's value, you maximize your chances of getting a price closer to your desired outcome while still having the security of John's offer."
