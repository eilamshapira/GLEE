You have three options:

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer matches my maximum price, there's a chance I could get the product for less. I'll start the negotiation by proposing a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer (about 66% of Alice's initial price). This leaves room for negotiation while still potentially securing a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice lowered her price significantly, indicating a willingness to negotiate. There's still room to try for a better deal before accepting $100 or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm meeting Alice halfway between her current offer ($100) and my previous offer ($80). This shows I'm willing to move closer to her price, but I'm still seeking a discount."
