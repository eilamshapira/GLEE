Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $13,000 is better than John's $12,000 and is already above my minimum acceptable price, I'll accept it. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's lower offer.
