"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my exclusive product today for $150. This is a firm offerâ€”if you pass on it, I'll be finalizing the sale to another buyer at the same price. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to make a decision based on the value of the product to me and the available options.

The product is worth no more than $80 to me, meaning I wouldn't want to pay more than $80 for it.

Alice is offering the product for $150, which exceeds the value I place on it.

John is offering the same product for $80, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me.

If I accept Alice's offer, I would be paying $70 more than the product's value to me.
If I buy from John, I would be paying exactly what the product is worth to me.
