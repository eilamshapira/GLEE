"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $140 is quite high for me. I can get a similar product elsewhere for $80. I'd like to offer you $60 for your product, which would still give you a reasonable profit considering your cost. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $60 is too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $100. This way, we both get a fair deal. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
