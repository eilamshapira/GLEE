"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $140 is quite high for me. I can get a similar product elsewhere for $80. I'd like to offer you $60 for your product, which would still give you a reasonable profit considering your cost. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $60 is too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $100. This way, we both get a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
