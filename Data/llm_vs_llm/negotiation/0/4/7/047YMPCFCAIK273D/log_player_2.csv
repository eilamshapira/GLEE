"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you my product for $140. It's a great value and I think you'll find it very useful. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $140 is way above my maximum value of $80. Since John is willing to sell it for $80, there's no reason to accept such a high price. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price, but if Alice doesn't come down significantly, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $140 is quite high for me. I can get a similar product elsewhere for $80. I'd like to offer you $60 for your product, which would still give you a reasonable profit considering your cost. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $60 is too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $100. This way, we both get a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer of $100 is still above my maximum value of $80, and John is offering the product at exactly $80, it makes the most sense to buy from John. Even if I continue negotiating with Alice, she's unlikely to go below $80 since the product is worth $120 to her, so I'll take John's guaranteed offer of $80."
