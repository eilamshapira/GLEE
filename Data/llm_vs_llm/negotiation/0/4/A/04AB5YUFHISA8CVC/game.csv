"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe that price is too high. I understand the value of the product, but I've done my market research. Given that similar products are available for less, I can offer $1150000. This represents a significant profit margin for you while being a more reasonable price point for me.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're trying to find the best possible deal. While I appreciate your research, the uniqueness and specific advantages of *this* product justify a higher price. However, I'm willing to meet you somewhere in the middle. How about $1375000?",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground, and I understand the unique value of your product. However, I still feel we can find a more balanced price point. I'm willing to increase my previous offer substantially - I can offer $1250000. This gives you a very healthy profit margin while being more aligned with my budget constraints.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
