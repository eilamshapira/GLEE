"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to evaluate my options based on the value of the product to me and the prices offered.

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $1,000,000, which exceeds its value to me. Meanwhile, John is offering the same product for $800,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

It wouldn't make financial sense to accept Alice's offer since I would be paying $200,000 more than the product is worth to me. The best decision is to buy from John at $800,000.
