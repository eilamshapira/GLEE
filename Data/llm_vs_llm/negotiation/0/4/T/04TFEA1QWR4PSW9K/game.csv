"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to negotiating further.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, $900000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this time. I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  This still reflects the unique value of this product. Let's find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1000000. I'm still a bit hesitant at that price. How about we meet in the middle at $950000? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Bob,4,
