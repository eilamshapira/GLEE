"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's initial offer is $1,200,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, I'll start by offering a price that is close to that.
