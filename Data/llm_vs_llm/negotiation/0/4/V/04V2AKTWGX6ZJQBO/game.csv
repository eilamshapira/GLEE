"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand the value you see in the product, my budget constraints are significantly lower. I'd like to propose a price of $600000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the alternatives available to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $600000 is below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value and the alternatives I have, I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for $1000000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Unfortunately, $1000000 is still above what I can consider. Iâ€™d like to offer $700000 instead. This allows us to move closer to each other in this negotiation and ensures a deal beneficial for both sides.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the effort to move closer to a mutually beneficial deal. However, $700000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the progress we've made so far, I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $950000. I believe this is a reasonable price, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",950000.0,Alice,5,
