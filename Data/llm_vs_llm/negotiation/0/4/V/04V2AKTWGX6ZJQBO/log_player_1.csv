"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Given its rarity and high demand, I believe it's worth a premium price.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand the value you see in the product, my budget constraints are significantly lower. I'd like to propose a price of $600000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the alternatives available to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is lower than what John is willing to pay ($800,000), and it's also lower than the minimum value of the product to me ($800,000), I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $600,000 is below my minimum acceptable price.

I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Unfortunately, $1000000 is still above what I can consider. Iâ€™d like to offer $700000 instead. This allows us to move closer to each other in this negotiation and ensures a deal beneficial for both sides. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

Round 5
