Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $12,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed $10,000 from John
3. Bob will reject if the price is too high
4. I want to maximize my profit

I'll offer the product at $11,000, which:
- Gives me $1,000 more than John's offer
- Gives Bob $1,000 in value (difference between his valuation and my price)
- Is likely to be accepted as it's beneficial for both parties
