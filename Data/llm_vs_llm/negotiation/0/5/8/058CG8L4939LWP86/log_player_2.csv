"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really like. I'm offering it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first.  $100 is my maximum and I know she's willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower offer to see how much room there is for negotiation. It's still a profit for Alice if she accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better, I think there's still room for negotiation.  I'll try to nudge her down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $70 was a bit low.  How about $80, would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

I'm going up to $80, which is Alice's value. It's possible she might accept this, and even if she doesn't, it shows I'm willing to negotiate fairly."
