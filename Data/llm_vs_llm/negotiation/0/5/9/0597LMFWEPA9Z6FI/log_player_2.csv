"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $2,000,000 is clearly too high since it's double the price that John is offering ($1,000,000) and also exceeds my maximum value for the product. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. We still have 9 rounds left to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 500000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $500,000, which is half of John's price. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to John's offer. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground that's below $1,000,000, which is my maximum value for the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is still significantly higher than John's price of $1,000,000. While she did reduce her price from the initial $2,000,000, it's still not competitive. Since we still have 7 more rounds to negotiate, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. There's no reason to accept a price that's higher than John's guaranteed price of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'll increase my offer to $700,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer of $500,000, showing willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price well below John's $1,000,000. This leaves room for further negotiation while potentially saving $300,000 compared to John's price. If Alice rejects this, we can continue negotiating, or I always have the option to go with John's offer as a fallback."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still significantly higher than John's price of $1,000,000. Although she continues to lower her price, the current offer would mean paying $600,000 more than John's price, which doesn't make economic sense. We still have 5 more rounds to negotiate, so I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. If we can't reach a price below $1,000,000, we can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

I'll increase my offer to $800,000. This continues to show good faith in negotiations by raising my offer by $100,000 from the previous $700,000. This price would still save $200,000 compared to John's offer, making it potentially attractive for both parties. We still have several rounds left to negotiate, but if Alice doesn't start making offers below $1,000,000 soon, we might need to consider taking John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's becoming clear that Alice is not willing to offer a price below John's $1,000,000. Her price reductions are getting smaller (only $50,000 this time), and even after several rounds of negotiation, her price is still $550,000 above John's offer. Given that we're in Round 7 and Alice's offers are still significantly above our maximum value of $1,000,000, it's best to take John's guaranteed offer rather than risk further rounds of unsuccessful negotiation. This ensures we get the product at our maximum acceptable price without wasting more time."
