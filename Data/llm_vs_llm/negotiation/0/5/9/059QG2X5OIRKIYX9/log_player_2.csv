"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $1,500,000, reject it, or buy from John for the same price.

Since Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000, which is exactly the same price as John's offer, and also exactly at my maximum valuation, there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other.

Given there's no price difference, I might as well accept Alice's offer since she's the primary seller I'm negotiating with.
