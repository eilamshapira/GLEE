"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given the options:

*   **(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000:** This is the best immediate financial outcome. You get the product for less than your maximum willingness to pay ($1,200,000).
*   **(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer:** This carries risk. Alice might not accept your counteroffer, or the next offer from Alice might be worse.
*   **(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000:** This is the worst financial outcome, but still acceptable as it is within your maximum willingness to pay.

Since you can get the product for $1,150,000 from Alice right now, which is better than buying it from John and is a good deal based on your value for the product, you should accept the offer.
