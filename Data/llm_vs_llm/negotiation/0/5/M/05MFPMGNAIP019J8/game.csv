"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but $2000000 exceeds my budget. I'm willing to pay $500000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to your response.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $500000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to lower my initial price to $1800000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, and I'm looking forward to your response.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
