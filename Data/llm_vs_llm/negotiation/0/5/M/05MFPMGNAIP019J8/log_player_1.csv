Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm open to negotiations if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but $2000000 exceeds my budget. I'm willing to pay $500000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and even lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to send a counteroffer. My goal is to earn as much money as I can for the product, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.

Here's my counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $500,000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to lower my initial price to $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, and I'm looking forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
