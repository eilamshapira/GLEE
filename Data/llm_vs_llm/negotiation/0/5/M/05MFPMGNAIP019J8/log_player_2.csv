"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2000000. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm open to negotiations if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the offered price of $2,000,000 is above my budget of $1,000,000, and I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, I will reject Alice's offer. However, before considering buying from John, I'd like to negotiate further with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'm interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. Considering my maximum budget is $1,000,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer that is reasonable and shows my seriousness about purchasing the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $500000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to lower my initial price to $1800000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, and I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,800,000 is still above my budget of $1,000,000. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within my budget, I don't see a reason to accept Alice's offer or to continue negotiating if the price isn't going to come down significantly.
