Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'd like to start the negotiation at $14,500."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit higher than I was hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $13250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $13,250 is higher than my minimum price of $12,000 and lower than his maximum value of $15,000, I'll try to negotiate further to get closer to his maximum value.

My counteroffer will be $14,000, trying to meet Bob in the middle between his offer and my initial offer. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still believe the product is worth more. How about we meet at $14,000?""}"

Bob's offer:

Rejecting this offer and trying to negotiate further may risk losing the sale, and selling to John for $12,000 would result in a lower profit.

I accept Bob's offer of $13,500."
