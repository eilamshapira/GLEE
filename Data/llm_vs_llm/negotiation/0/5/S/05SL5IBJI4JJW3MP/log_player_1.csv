Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that I know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at that price, I'll start with a significantly higher offer to leave room for potential negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum acceptable price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","I will reject Bob's offer of $800,000 because it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, which I can get from John. There's no reason to accept an offer that's $700,000 below my guaranteed alternative.

I will now make a new counteroffer to Bob.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still significantly below my guaranteed option of $1,500,000 from John. Since Bob's previous offers have been substantially below my minimum acceptable price, and he's only increased his offer by $200,000, it seems unlikely that we'll reach a mutually beneficial agreement. At this point, it's best to take the guaranteed offer from John.
