Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will bring significant value to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to let it go for a price that I think is fair and reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 1,400,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer and the details. Taking into account the overall value and our mutual interests, I propose a price of $1200000 for the product. I believe this strikes a fair balance for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is higher than John's offer of $1,000,000, but still lower than the initial offer I made, I believe there's room for further negotiation to reach a more favorable price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, considering the product's value and my initial offer, I'm willing to make a concession but still need to meet a certain threshold. I propose a price of $1,350,000, which I believe is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1,350,000}"
