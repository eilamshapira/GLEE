Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my exclusive product at $3,000,000. I believe this product has exceptional value and will be a great addition to your portfolio. Please let me know if this offer interests you."", ""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $3000000 is significantly higher than the market value for this product. I have an alternative supplier offering the same product for $1200000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product, which gives you a quick sale while saving me the trouble of going with the other supplier. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
