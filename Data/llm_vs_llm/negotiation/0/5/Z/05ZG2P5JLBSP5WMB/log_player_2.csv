"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my exclusive product at $3000000. I believe this product has exceptional value and will be a great addition to your portfolio. Please let me know if this offer interests you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given that Alice is offering the product for $3,000,000, which is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($1,200,000) and John's alternative offer ($1,200,000), it doesn't make sense to accept this offer.

Since John is offering exactly at my maximum valuation ($1,200,000), I should try to negotiate with Alice first to see if I can get a better price before resorting to John's offer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $3,000,000 is significantly higher than the market value for this product. I have an alternative supplier offering the same product for $1,200,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product, which gives you a quick sale while saving me the trouble of going with the other supplier. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
