{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's too close to our fallback option.  We should start negotiating lower to see if we can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
``` 
This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer and is closer to Alice's value. This might encourage Alice to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice moved a little from her initial offer, we're still too close to John's price. We need to encourage Alice to meet us closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

We'll move up slightly from our previous offer to signal that we are willing to negotiate, but we still want a price significantly closer to our initial target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but slowly. We are still too close to John's price to accept. We'll continue to negotiate, but we need to start considering John's offer more seriously if we don't see significant movement soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm going to offer Alice her value for the product. This is a strong signal that I'm serious about buying but want a fair deal. It also puts the pressure on Alice, as she knows I have John as a backup option."
