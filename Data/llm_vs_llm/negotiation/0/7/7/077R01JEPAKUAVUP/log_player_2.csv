"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","The product is worth no more than $80 to me, but Alice is offering it for $200, which is significantly higher than my maximum value. John is offering the same product for $80, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me.

Since Alice's offer is much higher than both my maximum value and John's alternative price, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John instead.
