"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $180. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to make a decision about buying this product. Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $120 to me.
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $180.
3. I can buy the same product from John for $120.

Since Alice's price ($180) exceeds both the value of the product to me and John's price, the rational choice is to buy from John instead.
