"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $120. It's a great deal for a high-quality item. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $80 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $120
3. John is offering the same product for $80
4. If I buy from Alice, I'll pay $40 more than my maximum valuation
5. If I buy from John, I'll pay exactly what the product is worth to me

Since Alice's offer ($120) is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($80) and John's alternative offer ($80), it wouldn't be rational to accept Alice's offer. The best decision would be to buy from John.
