"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $1500000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1000000 for the product. Please let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit too low for us. Let's meet in the middle at $1350000. This way, we both give a little and gain a lot.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1350000 is still above what I'm willing to spend. How about we settle at $1100000? This is a fair increase from my last offer and still within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
