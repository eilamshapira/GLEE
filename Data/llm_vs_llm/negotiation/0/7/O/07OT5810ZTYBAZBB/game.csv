"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested in buying it, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a lower price.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget concerns. However, $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle at $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a price of $100, which is the highest I'm willing to pay. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Okay Bob, I hear you. $100 is getting closer. Considering the value you'll get from this product, would you be willing to go to $115? That's the lowest I can realistically go.",115.0,Alice,5,
