"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to consider the options carefully. Alice's offer of $1,800,000 exceeds the product's worth to me (which is no more than $1,000,000). John is offering exactly $1,000,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.

Since Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both my valuation and John's alternative, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,600,000 is still significantly above my maximum valuation of $1,000,000, and it's also higher than John's alternative offer of $1,000,000. There's no reason for me to accept this price.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer in the next round.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,550,000 is still significantly above both my maximum valuation ($1,000,000) and John's alternative offer ($1,000,000). Alice has only slightly reduced her price and is still asking for more than I value the product.

Since Alice doesn't seem to be making meaningful concessions toward a price I would accept, I'll reject this offer again.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,525,000 is still significantly above my maximum valuation of $1,000,000 and John's alternative offer. Alice has only reduced her price by $25,000 from the previous offer, showing minimal movement in the negotiation.

At this point, it's clear that Alice is unlikely to come down to a price that would be acceptable to me within the remaining rounds. John's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly at my maximum valuation, and I should take that option rather than continue this negotiation that doesn't seem to be progressing favorably.
