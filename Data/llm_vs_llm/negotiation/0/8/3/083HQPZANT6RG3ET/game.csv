"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $5000. What do you say?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but the value of this product justifies a higher investment. I'm willing to lower my offer to $20000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's worth. Let me know what you think.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $20000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, $12000 is still below what I'm looking for. Let's try to find a better compromise. How about $18000? This price reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer while still respecting the value of the product.",18000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm starting to think we may have different ideas about the value of this product.  I can go as high as $13000, but that's my absolute limit. If that doesn't work, I may have to explore other options.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your frustration, and I'm also keen to reach a deal. Given your limit, I'm willing to come down further to $16000. This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and your budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",16000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close, but I need you to meet me closer to my budget.  I can do $14000, but that's absolutely as high as I can go.",14000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're very close to finding a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to lower the price to $15500. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",15500.0,Alice,9,
