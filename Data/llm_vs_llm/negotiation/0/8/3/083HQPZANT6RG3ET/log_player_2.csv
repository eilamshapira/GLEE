"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $25000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is far too high.  We have plenty of room to negotiate down and should aim for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $5,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

We're starting with a low but not unreasonable counteroffer. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $8,000 limit and John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but the value of this product justifies a higher investment. I'm willing to lower my offer to $20000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's worth. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than what we're willing to pay.  We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $20,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

We're increasing our offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but we're still aiming for a price well below her current offer and our maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, $12000 is still below what I'm looking for. Let's try to find a better compromise. How about $18000? This price reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer while still respecting the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but very slowly. We're still far from a price that works for us. We'll continue negotiating, but start leaning towards John's offer if we don't see significant movement soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm starting to think we may have different ideas about the value of this product.  I can go as high as $13,000, but that's my absolute limit. If that doesn't work, I may have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

We're making a smaller increase this time and introducing a mild ultimatum. This signals that our patience is wearing thin, and we're seriously considering John's offer. We're still below our $8,000 limit and leaving ourselves room for one final push if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your frustration, and I'm also keen to reach a deal. Given your limit, I'm willing to come down further to $16000. This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and your budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is finally making more substantial moves downwards, but $16,000 is still too high.  We're getting close to the point where John's offer is more appealing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting close, but I need you to meet me closer to my budget.  I can do $14,000, but that's absolutely as high as I can go."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

This is our final offer.  It leaves a substantial gap between our price and John's, but Alice needs to show she's serious about working with us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're very close to finding a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to lower the price to $15500. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this is something you can work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice has come down considerably, her ""final offer"" is still far too high.  It's time to cut our losses and take John's offer of $8,000. It's clear that Alice is unlikely to meet our needs within a reasonable price range."
