"Bob, I'm excited you're interested in acquiring this exceptional product. Given its unique capabilities and the significant value it brings, my initial offer is $1800000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, $1800000 is significantly above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $500000.  This reflects a fair price considering market conditions and alternative options available to me.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $500000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. I have another buyer, John, willing to pay $1500000. To continue negotiating with you, I'd need a more serious offer. How about $1650000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1650000 is still considerably outside my budget.  I'm aware of the interest from other buyers, but my valuation remains significantly lower. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650000. This represents a substantial jump and demonstrates my genuine interest.  I believe this is a fair offer considering my alternatives.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $650000 is still too low. My bottom line is $1500000 - that's what John is offering, and I'm willing to sell to him right now. To make it worth continuing this negotiation, I need an offer that at least gets close to that. Would you be willing to offer $1400000?",1400000.0,Alice,5,
