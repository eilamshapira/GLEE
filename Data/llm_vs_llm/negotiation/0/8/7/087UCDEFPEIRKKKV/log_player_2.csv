"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to consider my options carefully here:

1. Alice is offering the product for $1,150,000
2. The product is only worth $800,000 to me at maximum
3. John is willing to sell me the same product for $800,000
4. If I reject Alice's offer, I can make a counteroffer, but there's no guarantee we'll reach an agreement

Since Alice's offer ($1,150,000) is significantly above the maximum value of the product to me ($800,000), and John is offering exactly at my maximum valuation, the rational choice is to buy from John.
