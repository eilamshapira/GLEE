"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair price."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get a better price than $90. Since my minimum value for the product is $80, and Bob's offer is higher than that, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I still think the product is worth more than $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $105."", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of $105. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $97 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $97 is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since we're only in round 4, I have plenty of time to negotiate further. I'll make another counteroffer to try to meet Bob's price while still getting a good value for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I still need to get a good price for the product. Let's try $101."", ""product_price"": 101}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I think we're very close to an agreement. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $99 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $99 is very close to my target price, but I still think I can get a slightly better deal. Since we're only in round 6, I have a few more rounds to negotiate. I'll make another counteroffer to try to squeeze out a bit more value from the deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me closer to my target price. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I still need to get a price that reflects the product's value. Let's try $100."", ""product_price"": 100}"
