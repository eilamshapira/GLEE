"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $119 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I can see that $119 was a bit high for you, but I'm not comfortable selling it for $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and lower the price to $112. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",112.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $112 is still a bit high for me. Could you consider going down to $108? I think that would be a great deal for both of us.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your new offer. I can see that we're getting close to a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to lower the price a bit more, but I'm not quite at $108. How about we meet at $110? I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
