Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, $20000 is significantly beyond my budget. The product is worth no more than $12000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $10000 for the product, which gives you a chance to beat my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your counteroffer. I understand the product's value might be perceived differently, but $10,000 is significantly below its true worth and my bottom line. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $15,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15000 is still more than the product is worth to me, and it's also more than John's offer of $12000. To make our deal worthwhile for me compared to my alternative option, I need a better price. I'm willing to offer $11500, which would save me a little compared to John's offer while still giving you a reasonable profit based on the product's worth to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here, but I need you to meet me closer to my valuation. I understand John's offer is tempting, but I believe the quality of my product surpasses what he can offer.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is my final offer."",
