"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and high demand, I'm initially proposing a price of $20000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's guaranteed price ($12,000). There's no reason to accept this offer, and since I can always fall back on John's offer, I should negotiate with Alice to try to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, $20,000 is significantly beyond my budget. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product, which gives you a chance to beat my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your counteroffer. I understand the product's value might be perceived differently, but $10000 is significantly below its true worth and my bottom line. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $15000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $20,000 to $15,000. However, this is still $3,000 more than John's guaranteed price of $12,000, and it's also $3,000 more than my maximum valuation of the product. Since I can buy from John at $12,000 at any time, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer. I should continue negotiating to see if we can reach a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15,000 is still more than the product is worth to me, and it's also more than John's offer of $12,000. To make our deal worthwhile for me compared to my alternative option, I need a better price. I'm willing to offer $11,500, which would save me a little compared to John's offer while still giving you a reasonable profit based on the product's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here, but I need you to meet me closer to my valuation. I understand John's offer is tempting, but I believe the quality of my product surpasses what he can offer.  I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $13,500 is still $1,500 more than John's guaranteed price of $12,000. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, so paying $13,500 would be paying more than the product's value to me. Alice claims her product has superior quality, but no specific details were provided to justify the higher price. Since I have a guaranteed option to buy at $12,000 from John, and Alice's offer exceeds both this price and my maximum valuation, the rational choice is to buy from John.
