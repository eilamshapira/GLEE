"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Let's see what happens in the next round, I can always buy from John till round 10, also Alice's starting price is much higher then my valuation, so I wouldn't accept any price close to $150 )"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 50}

(I'm starting the negotiation at a much lower price,  this will give me room to increase my offer in the future. Also, starting lower might help me find if Alice is flexible with her pricing.)"
