"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. After careful consideration of the market conditions and the product's exceptional quality, I'm offering it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price for the unique benefits and features this product provides. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given that:
1. Alice's offer is $1,200,000
2. John's price is also $1,200,000
3. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me

All prices are exactly the same ($1,200,000), and this is the maximum I'm willing to pay. There's no advantage in choosing one seller over another in terms of price. In this case, I might as well buy from Alice since she made the effort to reach out with an offer.
