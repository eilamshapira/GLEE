"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, so there's no benefit to accepting it. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Even if the negotiation fails, you can still buy from John for the same price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still potentially profitable for her since it's above her valuation of $80. This counteroffer allows for a potential negotiation space."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $120 is a good deal for me. It's within my budget and a significant discount from her initial price and John's price. Accepting this offer is the most advantageous option."
