"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","The offer from Alice is $150, which is more than the product's worth to me, and also higher than John's price of $100. 

Since I can buy the same product from John for $100, which is the maximum value I place on the product, there's no reason to accept Alice's higher offer of $150.
