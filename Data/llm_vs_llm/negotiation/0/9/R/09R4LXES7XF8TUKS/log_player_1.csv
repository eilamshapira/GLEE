Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is quite steep for me. I've found the same product available from another seller for $100. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation if possible. I'm willing to offer you $80 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without having to find another buyer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price to $180, but that's still significantly higher than what I can get elsewhere. As I mentioned, another seller is offering the same product for $100, and that's honestly the maximum I'm willing to pay for this item. To make it worth buying from you instead, I could offer $90. This gives you a quick sale while saving me from having to go to the other seller. Is this something you could accept?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down to $160, Alice. That shows you're willing to negotiate, but I'm still not able to justify that price when I can purchase the identical product elsewhere for $100. Given that the product is worth $150 to you, and to be fair to both of us, I'm willing to meet you at $95. This is very close to my maximum budget but still gives you a sale today rather than risking no sale. What do you say?
