"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $200. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to carefully consider this offer from Alice. The product is worth at most $100 to me, and Alice is offering it at $200, which is significantly higher than its value to me. Also, I know I have the option to buy the same product from John for $100, which aligns exactly with the maximum value I place on it.

Since Alice's offer of $200 is double my maximum value and double what John is charging, it doesn't make financial sense to accept her offer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is quite steep for me. I've found the same product available from another seller for $100.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $80 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to lower my price to $180, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $180 is still well above both my maximum value for the product ($100) and what John is charging ($100). While she has reduced her price, it's still not financially sensible for me to accept this offer when I have a better alternative available.

As I mentioned, another seller is offering the same product for $100, and that's honestly the maximum I'm willing to pay for this item. To make it worth buying from you instead, I could offer $90. This gives you a quick sale while saving me from having to go to the other seller. Is this something you could accept?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see where you're coming from, but I can't go lower than $160. This price is still a good deal and it's the best I can do while ensuring I meet my minimum requirements. Let me know if you can work with this.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has lowered her price to $160, which shows some flexibility, but it's still $60 more than what I can pay to John ($100) and still exceeds the maximum value I place on the product ($100). While I appreciate Alice's continued negotiation, it's not economically rational for me to accept an offer that's 60% higher than my alternative option.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down to $160, Alice. That shows you're willing to negotiate, but I'm still not able to justify that price when I can purchase the identical product elsewhere for $100. Given that the product is worth $150 to you, and to be fair to both of us, I'm willing to meet you at $95. This is very close to my maximum budget but still gives you a sale today rather than risking no sale. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your constraints, but I need to stick to my minimum price. I can offer the product for $155, which is very close to my bottom line. This is the best I can do to meet you halfway while ensuring I don't lose out. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has made another reduced offer of $155, but this is still $55 higher than the $100 I can pay to John. Since the product is only worth up to $100 to me, paying $155 would mean I'm losing $55 in value. 

While Alice has been negotiating in good faith and is getting closer to her bottom line (she mentioned the product is worth $150 to her), it still doesn't make financial sense for me to accept this offer when I have a better alternative.
