"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I need to consider my position carefully. The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price. However, I'll see if I can get a better deal from Bob.

{""product_price"": $1,800,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000, and I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price slightly but ensure it stays above my minimum threshold, since I know I always have John's offer as a backup.

{""product_price"": $1,650,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. Given that I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I need to be more strategic with my counteroffer. Since I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob (as mentioned in my initial instructions), he won't pay more than that. However, I also have John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. Let me make a more reasonable counteroffer that's closer to my minimum threshold.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. Since I have John's guaranteed offer at $1,500,000, and we're now in round 6 of 10, I'll reject this offer.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","At this point, I need to be more direct. Given that Bob's offers are still far below my minimum threshold and the product is only worth $1,200,000 to him (which is below my minimum of $1,500,000), it's unlikely we'll reach a deal that benefits me more than John's offer.
