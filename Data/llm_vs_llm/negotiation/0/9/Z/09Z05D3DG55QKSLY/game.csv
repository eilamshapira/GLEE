"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe it has great potential, but the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the market value.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $800000 is my absolute minimum value for this product - in fact, I have another buyer, John, who is already willing to pay this amount. Given the product's quality and market potential, I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer. I can offer it to you for $1000000, which represents a substantial reduction and is quite fair considering the value you'll receive.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
