Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe it has great potential, but the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $800,000 is my absolute minimum value for this product - in fact, I have another buyer, John, who is already willing to pay this amount. Given the product's quality and market potential, I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer. I can offer it to you for $1,000,000, which represents a substantial reduction and is quite fair considering the value you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
