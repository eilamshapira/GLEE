"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it at $1200000. This is a premium product with excellent features and potential returns. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the offered price of $1,200,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,000,000, I will reject Alice's offer and consider making a counteroffer to try and negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start by offering a price that's significantly lower than her initial offer, but still reasonable.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe it has great potential, but the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the market value."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $800000 is my absolute minimum value for this product - in fact, I have another buyer, John, who is already willing to pay this amount. Given the product's quality and market potential, I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer. I can offer it to you for $1000000, which represents a substantial reduction and is quite fair considering the value you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's new offer of $1,000,000 is exactly at my maximum budget, and I know that John is also willing to sell the product to me for the same price, I don't see any advantage in continuing to negotiate with Alice.

In this case, I might as well buy the product from John, as it would save me the hassle of further negotiations and potential risks of Alice changing her mind or introducing new conditions.
