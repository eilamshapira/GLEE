Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $95, which I think is a fair price given its quality and value."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I think $85 is a more reasonable price for the product. Would you be willing to sell it for this price instead? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $85 is still too low considering the product's value to Bob. I can potentially get a better price, and I still have John's $80 offer as a backup if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $85 is still too low for this product's value. I can come down to $90, which I believe is a fair compromise given the quality and value you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I think we can settle at $87. This price point seems more balanced to me. Would you agree to this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $87. This is a reasonable compromise that gives me $7 more than John's offer, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. The price is above my minimum threshold of $80 and represents a fair middle ground in our negotiation."
