"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is simply too low for me.  This product holds significant value, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000. Let's work together to make this happen.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering your latest offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours. I'll offer $1000000, which is the highest I'm comfortable going without exploring other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your position, but $1000000 still falls short of what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $1100000. This is my final offer before I explore other options.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
