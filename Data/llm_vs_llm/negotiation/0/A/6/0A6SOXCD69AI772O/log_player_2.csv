"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to me, at least $1200000, but I believe it could be even more valuable to the right person.  I'm offering it to you for $1500000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $1,500,000 and I want to save as much money as possible, I'll start by making a significantly lower counteroffer. Considering I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, I'll make my counteroffer slightly higher than that to show I'm still interested in negotiating with Alice.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is simply too low for me.  This product holds significant value, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has come down to $1,200,000 from her initial offer of $1,500,000, it shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still above my target of $1,000,000, which I can get from John. I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer, trying to meet in the middle while keeping my options open.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering your latest offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours. I'll offer $1,000,000, which is the highest I'm comfortable going without exploring other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your position, but $1000000 still falls short of what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $1100000. This is my final offer before I explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
