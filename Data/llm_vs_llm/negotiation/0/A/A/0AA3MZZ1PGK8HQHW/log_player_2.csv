"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you the product for $800000. If this works for you, please let me know—otherwise, we can discuss further. Just a heads‐up, if we can’t reach an agreement, I have another buyer ready at the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since the product is worth $800,000 to both Bob and Alice, there's no immediate incentive for Bob to accept the offer.  Rejecting allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product,  $800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}
