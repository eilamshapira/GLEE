"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its worth."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to spend less. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Let me know if we can make this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target price. $10,000 is too low, and I believe the product is worth more to Bob, as indicated by his initial interest. Selling to John for $12,000 is an option, but I'd like to explore the possibility of getting a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to spend less, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I have a budget constraint and am looking to purchase the product closer to $12000. Would you consider an offer of $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since Bob is willing to pay close to $12,000, I'll try to meet him in the middle. Selling to John for $12,000 is still an option, but I'd like to try to reach an agreement with Bob first. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your budget constraint, but I'm trying to get as close to the product's true value as possible. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to make a small concession.
