"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is far above my budget. Given the current market conditions and my research on similar products, I would like to make a counteroffer of $6000. This is a reasonable price that would work well for both of us.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $6000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's value and the fact that I have other interested buyers, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer the product to you for $18000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be direct - $18000 is still far beyond what I can justify for this product. While I understand you have other interested buyers, I need to stay within my budget constraints. I can increase my offer to $7000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is close to the maximum I can spend on this product.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your transparency about your budget constraints. Considering your willingness to increase your offer, I'm willing to make a significant concession. I'd like to offer the product to you for $12000, which is a substantial reduction from my previous prices. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget limitations while still reflecting the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations, but I believe this is a reasonable compromise.",12000.0,Alice,5,
