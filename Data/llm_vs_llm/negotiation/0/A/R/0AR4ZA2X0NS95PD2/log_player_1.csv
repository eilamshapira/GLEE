"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is far above my budget. Given the current market conditions and my research on similar products, I would like to make a counteroffer of $6000. This is a reasonable price that would work well for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me, and I have a better alternative with John's offer of $10,000, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $6,000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's value and the fact that I have other interested buyers, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer the product to you for $18,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be direct - $18000 is still far beyond what I can justify for this product. While I understand you have other interested buyers, I need to stay within my budget constraints. I can increase my offer to $7000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is close to the maximum I can spend on this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $7,000 is still lower than John's offer of $10,000, and I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob or explore other options. Since Bob mentioned that $7,000 is close to his maximum budget, I'll try to make a counteroffer that is closer to his limit while still being higher than John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your transparency about your budget constraints. Considering your willingness to increase your offer, I'm willing to make a significant concession. I'd like to offer the product to you for $12,000, which is a substantial reduction from my previous prices. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget limitations while still reflecting the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations, but I believe this is a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
