"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reason: Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000. Even John's fixed price of $8,000 is at my maximum limit. It's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations don't progress favorably, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20,000 is far above my budget. Given the current market conditions and my research on similar products, I would like to make a counteroffer of $6,000. This is a reasonable price that would work well for both of us."", ""product_price"": 6000}

Reason: I'm starting with an offer of $6,000 which is below my maximum value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate upward if necessary while still potentially saving money compared to John's price of $8,000. If Alice rejects this and subsequent negotiations don't work out, I can still fall back on John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $6000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's value and the fact that I have other interested buyers, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer the product to you for $18000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reason: Alice's new offer of $18,000, while lower than her initial offer, is still substantially above my maximum value of $8,000. The reduction from $20,000 to $18,000 suggests she has room to negotiate further, but her high counter indicates she might be far from my target range. I'll continue negotiating, but if Alice doesn't come down significantly in the next rounds, I can always take John's offer of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be direct - $18,000 is still far beyond what I can justify for this product. While I understand you have other interested buyers, I need to stay within my budget constraints. I can increase my offer to $7,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is close to the maximum I can spend on this product."", ""product_price"": 7000}

Reason: I've increased my offer to $7,000, which is getting closer to my maximum value of $8,000 but still leaves me some room to negotiate if needed. This significant increase from my previous offer of $6,000 shows I'm serious about making a deal, while still keeping me under John's price. If Alice doesn't come down substantially in response to this offer, it might be better to take John's offer in the next rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your transparency about your budget constraints. Considering your willingness to increase your offer, I'm willing to make a significant concession. I'd like to offer the product to you for $12000, which is a substantial reduction from my previous prices. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget limitations while still reflecting the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations, but I believe this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Reason: While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by dropping her price significantly from $18,000 to $12,000, she's still substantially above my maximum value of $8,000. The rate at which she's decreasing her price (from $20,000 to $18,000 to $12,000) suggests that even with more rounds of negotiation, it would be difficult to reach a price below $8,000. Since John's offering the product at $8,000, which is exactly at my maximum value, it's better to take his offer now rather than risk more rounds of potentially unsuccessful negotiations with Alice."
