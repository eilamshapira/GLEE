"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is twice the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($10,000), it's not a good deal for me. I'd like to try to negotiate a better price. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm willing to pay up to $10,000, I'll offer half of that amount to see how Alice responds.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $17,000 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. While it's a slight improvement from her initial offer, it's not enough to convince me to accept. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice reduced her price from $20,000 to $17,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer of $5,000 and her new offer. I'll increase my offer to $7,000, which is still below my maximum budget of $10,000.

{""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $14,000 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000, but it's getting closer. However, I'm not willing to pay $4,000 more than I have to, since I can buy the product from John for $10,000. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further, hoping to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice reduced her price from $17,000 to $14,000, I'll try to make a more aggressive counteroffer. I'll increase my previous offer of $7,000 to $8,500, which is still below my maximum budget of $10,000. This offer is also closer to the price I can get from John, so I'm hoping Alice will consider it.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $12,500 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000, but it's getting very close. At this point, I'm starting to think that I might not be able to get a better deal from Alice. Since I can buy the product from John for $10,000, which is $2,500 less than Alice's offer, I think it's time to consider walking away from the negotiation with Alice.
