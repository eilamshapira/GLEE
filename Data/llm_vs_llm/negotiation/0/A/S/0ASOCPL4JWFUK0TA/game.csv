"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900000 for it. This offer reflects my budget and the value I see in the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, I need to be transparent - I have another buyer willing to pay $1000000, so I cannot accept anything below that price. Given that this product is worth $1200000 to the right buyer, I'm willing to reduce my asking price to $1100000. This is a fair price that still leaves you with significant value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand your position and I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1000000. That's a fair price considering the other buyer's offer and leaves us both with a good deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and reach the $1000000 mark. However, we both know this product would provide you with $1200000 in value. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1050000. This would allow you to still realize $150000 in value while giving me a fair return. This is my best and final offer - it's a win-win proposition for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
