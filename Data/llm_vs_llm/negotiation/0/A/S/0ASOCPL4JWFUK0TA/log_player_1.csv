Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its market value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900000 for it. This offer reflects my budget and the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a new counteroffer since Bob's offer of $900,000 is below even my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Additionally, since I can sell to John for $1,000,000, there's no reason to accept an offer below that amount. Let me make a more moderate counteroffer to continue negotiations with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, I need to be transparent - I have another buyer willing to pay $1,000,000, so I cannot accept anything below that price. Given that this product is worth $1,200,000 to the right buyer, I'm willing to reduce my asking price to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still leaves you with significant value."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1000000. That's a fair price considering the other buyer's offer and leaves us both with a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. Since Bob knows the product is worth $1,200,000 to him and he's shown willingness to negotiate upward, I should try one more time to secure a better price than what John is offering. There's no risk in making another counteroffer since I can still fall back on John's $1,000,000 offer if needed."

However, we both know this product would provide you with $1,200,000 in value. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,050,000. This would allow you to still realize $150,000 in value while giving me a fair return. This is my best and final offer - it's a win-win proposition for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
