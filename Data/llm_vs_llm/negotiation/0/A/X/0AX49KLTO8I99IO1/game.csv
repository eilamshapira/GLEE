"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $95. I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to negotiate further.

I believe this price is more reflective of its worth and still a good deal for you.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $98. I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. After considering your latest proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $99, which I believe is a very reasonable price given its value. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to you, as I think it's a fair compromise.",99.0,Alice,5,
