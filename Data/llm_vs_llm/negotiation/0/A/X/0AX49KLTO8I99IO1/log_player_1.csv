Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. However, I think the product's price is still a bit high for me. I'm now willing to pay $95. How does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to meet him at a price that's closer to my target. My next offer will be $100. This is still below the $120 value Bob has for the product, but higher than his current offer of $95, giving us both room to negotiate further."

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since he's willing to raise his offer to $98, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. My next offer will be $99. This is a small increase from his offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to him is $120."
