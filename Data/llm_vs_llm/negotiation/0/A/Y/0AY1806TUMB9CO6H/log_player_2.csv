"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you know the product is worth to John.  It makes sense to negotiate or go with John directly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

This is a starting offer significantly below Alice's asking price, but still potentially profitable for her. It leaves room for negotiation while signaling that you're serious about buying but not at an unreasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice came down a bit, but it's still far too high. We'll continue negotiating, but we need to move the price significantly.  We're getting closer to a point where John's offer might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 700000
}
```

This offer shows a willingness to move closer to a reasonable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to see if Alice is willing to engage in a meaningful way."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice is coming down in smaller increments now, but it's still not a good deal. We're getting closer to the point where buying from John makes more sense.  We need to signal we're getting impatient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 725000
}
```

This offer is a smaller increase, showing we're getting closer to our limit. Alice needs to make a more significant move if she wants a deal."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice is holding firm at a price that's not acceptable.  We're running out of time to make a deal worthwhile, so we need to consider John's offer more seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 750000
}
```

This is my final offer.  It's getting too risky to continue negotiating with only a few rounds left, and I need to signal that I'm serious about taking John's offer if Alice doesn't make a significant move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

It's too late. Alice is unlikely to come down to an acceptable price in just one round.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $800,000."
