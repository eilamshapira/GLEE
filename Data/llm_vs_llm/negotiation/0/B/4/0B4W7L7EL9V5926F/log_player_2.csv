"Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $17,000 exceeds both the maximum I'm willing to pay ($12,000) and John's alternative price ($12,000), this is not a good deal for me. The offer is $5,000 more than my maximum valuation.

John's offer is exactly at my maximum value threshold ($12,000), which means I would get the product at a price that's acceptable to me.

While I could reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, there's a risk that negotiations might not reach a price below $12,000, especially since the product is worth $15,000 to Alice. The guaranteed option from John is the safer choice.
