"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll love. How about I sell it to you for $200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully. Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering the product for $200
2. The product is worth no more than $80 to me
3. John is willing to sell me the exact same product for $80
4. If I reject Alice's offer, I can make a counteroffer

Since Alice's price ($200) is significantly higher than the product's worth to me ($80) and also higher than John's price ($80), it doesn't make sense to accept this offer.

Given that John's price matches the maximum value of the product to me, and dealing with Alice involves uncertainty and potential back-and-forth negotiation, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
