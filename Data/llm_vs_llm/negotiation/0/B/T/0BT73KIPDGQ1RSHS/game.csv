"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. Unfortunately, $1600000 is well above my budget. I'm serious about buying, but I can only go as high as $1000000 for this product. Let me know if we can work with that figure.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1000000 is lower than I can accept at this stage. The product's true worth is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1500000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
