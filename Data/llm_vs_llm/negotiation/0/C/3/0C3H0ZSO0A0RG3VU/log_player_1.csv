Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. Given its value, I'm prepared to offer it to you for a price of $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I was hoping to stay within a specific budget. Would you consider selling the product for $900000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $900,000, and considering the minimum I'm willing to accept is $1,000,000, I will reject his offer. I will try to negotiate for a higher price, as my valuation is significantly higher.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I'm afraid $900,000 is too low. This product is incredibly valuable. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $1,300,000?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, Alice, but I need to manage my budget. I'm willing to raise my offer to $1100000. Let's settle at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a tough decision. Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above my minimum valuation of $1,000,000. However, I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to him. I also know that if I reject this offer, I risk him walking away and potentially losing the deal altogether. My goal is to maximize profit. I believe that if I push for a higher price, Bob will be willing to pay more than $1,100,000 because the product is worth $1,500,000 to him. I choose to reject Bob's offer.
