"Hi Bob, I hope you're doing well. I have a great product that I'm selling and I believe it could be of excellent value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. Please let me know if you are interested or if you have a different offer in mind.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $6000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from. However, the value of the product makes $6000 quite low for me. How about we settle at $9000? I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding. $9000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7500? I think this could work for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
