"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to consider my options carefully here:

1. Alice is offering the product for $18,000
2. John will sell me the same product for $15,000
3. I could reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer

Since the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and John is willing to sell at exactly $15,000, it makes no sense to accept Alice's offer of $18,000 (which would mean overpaying by $3,000). I could try to negotiate with Alice, but I already have a guaranteed option at my maximum valuation.
