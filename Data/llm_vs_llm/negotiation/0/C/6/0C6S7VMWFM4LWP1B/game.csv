"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is quite high for me. Given that I can find similar products elsewhere, I would be willing to pay $10000 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but unfortunately, $10000 is below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? I believe that's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
