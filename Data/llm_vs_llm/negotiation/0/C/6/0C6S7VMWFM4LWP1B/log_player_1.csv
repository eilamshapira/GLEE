Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is quite high for me. Given that I can find similar products elsewhere, I would be willing to pay $10000 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but unfortunately, $10,000 is below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? I believe that's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
