"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an exceptional product I'm offering, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given that Alice's offer is $15,000, which is exactly the same as John's price and equal to my maximum valuation, there's no advantage in accepting Alice's offer over buying from John. Additionally, since this is the first offer, it might be worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower to leave room for negotiation but not so low as to appear unreasonable.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is quite high for me. Given that I can find similar products elsewhere, I would be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but unfortunately, $10000 is below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? I believe that's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price by $1,500 from her initial offer, which is a good sign. The current offer of $13,500 is better than John's price of $15,000, representing a $1,500 saving. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might become less flexible or withdraw from negotiations. Since we've already secured a price that's significantly below our maximum budget and John's price, it's reasonable to accept this offer.
