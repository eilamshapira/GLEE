Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider both my interests and Bob's. The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and Bob values it at $1,200,000. Since I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, that's my BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement).

Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, he won't accept any offer above that amount. However, I need to get at least $1,500,000 to match my alternative with John.

Given that my minimum ($1,500,000) exceeds Bob's maximum ($1,200,000), there's no zone of possible agreement with Bob. The rational choice is to sell to John immediately, but I'll start by making an offer to Bob.
