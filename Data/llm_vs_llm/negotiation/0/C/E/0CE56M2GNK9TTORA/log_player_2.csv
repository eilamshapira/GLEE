"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given that I'm looking for a product that is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, and Alice is offering it at $1,500,000, this price exceeds my valuation. John is offering the same product for exactly $1,200,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since I can't profitably accept Alice's current offer of $1,500,000, and I have the option to buy from John at my maximum valuation, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
