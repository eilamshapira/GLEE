"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $10,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $8,000.
