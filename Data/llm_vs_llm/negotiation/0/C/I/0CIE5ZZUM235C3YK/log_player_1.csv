Send your offer to Bob.,"Since the product is worth $150 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $150, there's no reason for me to sell to Bob for less than $150. Since Bob values the product at $120, he will reject any offer of $150 or more, but that's fine because I can then sell to John.
