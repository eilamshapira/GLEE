"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $9,500 is less than $10,000, it's a good deal. Additionally, buying from John would cost me $10,000, which is more than Alice's offer. Therefore, I will accept Alice's offer.
