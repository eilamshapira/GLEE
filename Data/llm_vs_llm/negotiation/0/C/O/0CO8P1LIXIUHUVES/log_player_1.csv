Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point because it's more than my minimum value of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaching a price closer to Bob's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a bit low, but it's still closer to my minimum than John's offer.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,250. It's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement."
