"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since the product is worth $12,000 to me and Alice's offer is $11,500, which is less than what I'm willing to pay, I'll consider rejecting the offer to see if I can get a better deal. However, the difference between Alice's offer and my maximum budget is only $500, which might not be worth the risk of losing the deal or having to negotiate further.

Given that Alice's initial offer is already close to my maximum budget and considering the product's value to Alice is $10,000, there's a potential for further negotiation. But, starting with a counteroffer might give me a better insight into Alice's flexibility with the price.

For now, I'll choose to reject the offer and make a counteroffer to test the waters.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's initial offer of $11,500 and the product's value to her being $10,000, I'll aim to make a counteroffer that is reasonable and potentially acceptable to both parties. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'll start by offering a price that is lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than the product's value to her, to ensure the negotiation remains viable.

My counteroffer will be $10,750. This price is above Alice's valuation of the product, which should make it an attractive option for her, and it's also below my maximum budget, allowing me to save some money.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has made a new offer of $11,250 after rejecting my counteroffer of $10,750. This indicates that she is willing to negotiate further and has moved closer to my desired price range.

Given that Alice's new offer of $11,250 is still below my maximum budget of $12,000 and considering that she has already come down from her initial offer of $11,500, I believe there might be some room for further negotiation. However, the difference between her current offer and my previous counteroffer is $500, which suggests that we are getting closer to a mutually acceptable price.

At this point, accepting Alice's offer would save me $750 compared to buying from John, which is a significant savings. On the other hand, making another counteroffer risks Alice not being willing to move further down in price, potentially ending the negotiation.

Considering these factors, I think the potential savings from further negotiation might not be worth the risk of losing the deal. Therefore, I'll choose to accept Alice's offer of $11,250.
