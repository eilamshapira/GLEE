Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic decision about the price to offer Bob. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and I have a fallback option of selling to John for $800,000 if Bob rejects my offer.

Since Bob knows I have this fallback option, I should offer a price that gives Bob some incentive to accept while maximizing my profit. If I ask for the full $1,000,000, Bob might reject it since he would get no surplus value. 

I'll offer a price slightly below Bob's valuation to give him some incentive to accept, while still significantly above my fallback option.
