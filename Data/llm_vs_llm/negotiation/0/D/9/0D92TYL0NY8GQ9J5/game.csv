"Hello Bob, I'm delighted you're interested in my product. It's a truly unique item with exceptional value. To begin, I'm offering it to you for $25000.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, that price is significantly above my budget.  I'm genuinely interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. $8000 is a bit lower than I can accept. However, I'm willing to come down. How about $23000?",23000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $23000 is still far too high.  I'm comfortable offering $10000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can both benefit from a deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best possible price. While $10000 is still below my minimum, I am motivated to make a deal with you. Let's meet in the middle a bit more. How about $20000?",20000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $20000 is still quite high.  I'm willing to go up to $12000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
