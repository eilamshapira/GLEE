Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your continued willingness to compromise. However, $20000 is still above my budget. Considering your previous offer and my budget constraints, I'd like to propose a price of $14000. This is the highest I'm willing to go before considering alternative options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Given that Bob's offer of $14,000 is lower than John's offer of $15,000, and considering that Bob has stated that $14,000 is the highest he's willing to go, it's unlikely that further negotiations with Bob will result in a better offer. Therefore, selling the product to John for $15,000 is the most profitable option."
