"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $500000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $500000 is significantly below the product's value. Given that I have another buyer willing to pay $1000000, I would need an offer substantially above that to consider selling to you. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1800000, which I believe better reflects the product's true market value while still offering you potential for significant returns. Would you consider this revised offer?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that you have another buyer willing to pay $1000000. I'm willing to pay a bit more than that, but I still need to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product to me for $750000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
