"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its unique features and market value, I'm offering it at $2,500,000. This is a premium product with significant potential value. What do you think about this offer?"", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $500000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll follow up with a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but since he's showing interest, I'll try to negotiate to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $500,000 is significantly below the product's value. Given that I have another buyer willing to pay $1,000,000, I would need an offer substantially above that to consider selling to you. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1,800,000, which I believe better reflects the product's true market value while still offering you potential for significant returns. Would you consider this revised offer?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that you have another buyer willing to pay $1000000. I'm willing to pay a bit more than that, but I still need to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product to me for $750000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer is still below John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000, and Bob has indicated he needs to stay within his budget (which seems to be below $1,000,000), it's best to take John's certain offer rather than continue negotiations that may not exceed this amount."
