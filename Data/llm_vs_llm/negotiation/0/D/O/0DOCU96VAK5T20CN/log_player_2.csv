"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its unique features and market value, I'm offering it at $2500000. This is a premium product with significant potential value. What do you think about this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the offer of $2,500,000 is above my budget of $1,000,000, I will reject Alice's offer. Additionally, buying from John for $1,000,000 is a more attractive option at this point, but I'd like to explore the possibility of negotiating a better price with Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $2,500,000, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower, but still shows that I'm interested in the product. I'll offer $500,000, which is half of my maximum budget of $1,000,000.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $500,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $500000 is significantly below the product's value. Given that I have another buyer willing to pay $1000000, I would need an offer substantially above that to consider selling to you. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1800000, which I believe better reflects the product's true market value while still offering you potential for significant returns. Would you consider this revised offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's revised offer of $1,800,000 is still above my budget of $1,000,000. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within my budget, I don't see a need to accept Alice's offer. However, I'd like to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice mentioned that she has another buyer willing to pay $1,000,000, I'll use that as a reference point. I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than John's price, to show that I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but still within my budget.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that you have another buyer willing to pay $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a bit more than that, but I still need to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product to me for $750,000?"", ""product_price"": 750000}"
