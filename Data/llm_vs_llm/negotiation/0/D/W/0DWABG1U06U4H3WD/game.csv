"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $10000 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I've actually received an offer from another seller for $8000. I'd like to buy from you, but I can only do so if you can offer a better price. Would you be willing to sell it for $7000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you. However, I can't go down to $7000. How about we meet in the middle at $9000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9000 is still more than I can pay. As I mentioned, I have another offer for $8000. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I would need a better price than that. I can offer $7500. This would be a win for both of us - you'd make more than your cost, and I'd save compared to my other option.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to find a solution. Since you have an $8000 offer, I'm willing to go down to $8500. This will give you some savings and also allow me to make a good profit.",8500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I still can't justify paying $8500 when I have a firm offer of $8000 from John. If you can beat that price, I'd be happy to do business with you instead. My best offer is $7800. This would save me some money compared to John's offer, while still giving you a decent profit since the product is worth $8000 to you. What do you say?",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to come down to $8200. That's just a little bit above your other offer. It's a great deal for both of us.",8200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I still can't justify paying $8200 when I have a firm offer of $8000 from John. For me to choose you over John, I need a better price. My final offer is $7900. This would be a win-win for both of us - I save $100 compared to John's offer, and you make a small profit on your $8000 cost. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll need to go with John's offer.",7900.0,Bob,8,
