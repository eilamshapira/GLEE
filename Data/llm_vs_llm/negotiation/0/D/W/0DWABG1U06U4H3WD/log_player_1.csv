"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I'm looking to sell it for $10,000."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $10000 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I've actually received an offer from another seller for $8000. I'd like to buy from you, but I can only do so if you can offer a better price. Would you be willing to sell it for $7000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Given Bob's counteroffer and my options, I will:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you. However, I can't go down to $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9000 is still more than I can pay. As I mentioned, I have another offer for $8000. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I would need a better price than that. I can offer $7500. This would be a win for both of us - you'd make more than your cost, and I'd save compared to my other option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Considering the offers and the limited rounds, I will:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to find a solution. Since you have an $8,000 offer, I'm willing to go down to $8,500. This will give you some savings and also allow me to make a good profit."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I still can't justify paying $8500 when I have a firm offer of $8000 from John. If you can beat that price, I'd be happy to do business with you instead. My best offer is $7800. This would save me some money compared to John's offer, while still giving you a decent profit since the product is worth $8000 to you. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","This is getting close. My options are:
*   Accept $7,800 from Bob.
*   Counteroffer, which is risky, potentially losing the deal.
*   Sell to John for $8,000.

Given the dwindling rounds and the need to secure a deal, I will:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, I will make one last counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, you're right, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to come down to $8,200. That's just a little bit above your other offer. It's a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I still can't justify paying $8200 when I have a firm offer of $8000 from John. For me to choose you over John, I need a better price. My final offer is $7900. This would be a win-win for both of us - I save $100 compared to John's offer, and you make a small profit on your $8000 cost. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
