"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me. Alice is offering it for $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my valuation. If I reject, I can buy from John for $800,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.
