"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer ($150) is higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120), it would not be rational to accept this offer. Given that John's price is equal to my maximum value, I could buy from him, but it might be worth trying to negotiate with Alice first to potentially get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still reasonable, giving room for negotiation while trying to get a better price than John's $120.
