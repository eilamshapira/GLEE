Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price strategy here.

Given that:
1. The product is worth $800,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $800,000
3. Bob will likely reject if the price is too high
4. I want to maximize my profit

I'll offer slightly above the guaranteed price from John, but not so high that Bob will certainly reject.
