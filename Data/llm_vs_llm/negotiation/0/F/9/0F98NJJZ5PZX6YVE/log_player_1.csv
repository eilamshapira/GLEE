Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150} 
 
I've started with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($100) and John's offer. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product sounds interesting, but $150 is too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my minimum and John's offer. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  I understand your perspective on the price, but $60 is significantly less than its value. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}

I've come down from my initial offer but still kept the price well above both my minimum and John's offer.  This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a good profit."
