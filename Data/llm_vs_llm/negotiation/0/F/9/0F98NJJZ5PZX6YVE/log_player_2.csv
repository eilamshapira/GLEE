You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I should not accept Alice's offer because the price is $150, which is much more than my budget $80.
I should not buy from John because I still have a chance to negotiate with Alice.
So I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer.
