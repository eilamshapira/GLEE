"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is well above market value for this product. I know of similar products selling for much less. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8000, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8000 is too low for this product. I know the market well, and I can assure you that the quality and value of this product justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer - I can offer it to you for $12000, which is a significant reduction from my first price.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but I need to be honest with you - I can get the same product elsewhere for $10000, and that's actually the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $9000, which would be beneficial for both of us. Would you consider this?",9000.0,Bob,4,
