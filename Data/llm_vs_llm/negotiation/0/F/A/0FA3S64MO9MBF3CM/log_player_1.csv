"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is well above market value for this product. I know of similar products selling for much less. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8000, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. His offer of $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and I know the product is worth $10,000 to him. I'll aim to negotiate a price that's better for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is too low for this product. I know the market well, and I can assure you that the quality and value of this product justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer - I can offer it to you for $12,000, which is a significant reduction from my first price."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but I need to be honest with you - I can get the same product elsewhere for $10000, and that's actually the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $9000, which would be beneficial for both of us. Would you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $10,000. Bob has revealed that his maximum price is $10,000, and his current offer is still below that. Given that we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and Bob is still offering below my minimum acceptable price, it's best to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might not result in a better outcome."
