"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer of $15,000 is actually higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000), there's no reason to accept this offer. While I could immediately buy from John, it might be worth making a counteroffer to Alice first to try getting a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is well above market value for this product. I know of similar products selling for much less. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8000 is too low for this product. I know the market well, and I can assure you that the quality and value of this product justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer - I can offer it to you for $12000, which is a significant reduction from my first price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $12,000 is still above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000). Since I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $10,000, there's no reason to accept this higher price. I'll try one more counteroffer, but if Alice doesn't come down significantly, I'll go with John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a more compelling counteroffer, being transparent about my alternatives.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but I need to be honest with you - I can get the same product elsewhere for $10,000, and that's actually the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $9,000, which would be beneficial for both of us. Would you consider this?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
