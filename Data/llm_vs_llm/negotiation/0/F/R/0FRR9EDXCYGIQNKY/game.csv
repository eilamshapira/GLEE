,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that the initial price might have been a bit steep, but $60 is still quite far from what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'll meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm still not quite there. My budget is a bit tighter than that. Would you be willing to go down to $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm trying to be flexible, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'll come down a bit further, but I hope you can understand that I have a minimum price in mind. Let's try to meet in the middle again.",87.5,Alice,5,
