Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth."", ""product_price"": 150}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, the price is a bit higher than what I was expecting. I'm willing to pay $60 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $60 is too low for the product's value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that the initial price might have been a bit steep, but $60 is still quite far from what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm still not quite there. My budget is a bit tighter than that. Would you be willing to go down to $70?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer, as $70 is still below my target price. I'll try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm trying to be flexible, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'll come down a bit further, but I hope you can understand that I have a minimum price in mind.
