"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Let me make a strategic first offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to him, I'll start high to leave room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

{""product_price"": 1,400,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is only slightly above my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and we still have 8 rounds left for negotiation, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There's room for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial $1,400,000, but still maintain a strong position since Bob's previous offer shows he's willing to negotiate.

{""product_price"": 1,300,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob has increased his offer to $1,200,000, which is a significant improvement from his previous offer of $1,100,000. This shows he's willing to move up substantially. Since this is already a good profit margin above my minimum price ($1,000,000), and considering the risk that he might walk away if we continue negotiating too aggressively, I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
