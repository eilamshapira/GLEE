"Alice's offer: The product price will be $190. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $190
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","The offer from Alice is $190, which is significantly higher than the $120 that the product is worth to me. It's also much higher than John's offer of $120.

Given that:
1. Alice's offer ($190) exceeds my maximum valuation ($120)
2. John is willing to sell the same product for exactly $120
3. Buying from John would save me $70 compared to Alice's current offer

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer or continue negotiating when I can immediately get the product at my maximum value point from John.
