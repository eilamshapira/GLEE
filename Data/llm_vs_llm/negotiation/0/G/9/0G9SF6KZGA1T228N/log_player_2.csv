{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a price that is close to my maximum budget, but leaves some room for negotiation.

However, for now, I'll reject her offer and consider making another counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,100,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000, but it's getting closer to a reasonable price. Since she rejected my previous counteroffer of $650,000, I'll try to make another counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one, but still within my budget.

Before making another counteroffer, I'll consider the option to buy from John for $800,000, which is still a better deal for me. However, I'll give Alice another chance to negotiate.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer by $50,000 to $700,000, which is still below my maximum budget of $800,000. This offer shows that I'm willing to continue negotiating and find a mutually beneficial price.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,050,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. While she's getting closer to a reasonable price, I'm not willing to exceed my budget.

At this point, I think it's more beneficial for me to buy the product from John for $800,000, which is a better deal for me. I've given Alice enough chances to negotiate, and it's time for me to consider other options.
