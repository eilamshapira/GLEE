"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer ($8,000) is significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and even below what John is willing to pay, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial price somewhat but still maintain a strong position since I have John's offer as a backup.

{""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's second offer ($9,000) is still well below John's guaranteed offer of $12,000. Since we're already in round 4 and Bob's incremental increase is relatively small (only $1,000 more than his first offer), it seems he might not be willing to reach a price above $12,000. At this point, it's safer to take John's guaranteed offer rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome.
