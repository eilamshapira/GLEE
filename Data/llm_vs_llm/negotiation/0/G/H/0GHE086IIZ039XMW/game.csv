"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I believe the product has potential, $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $600000 is too low for this product's value. I can reduce my initial price to $1000000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Would this work for you?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a significant gap for me. To be honest, my budget for this product is closer to $800000. If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to purchase immediately. Otherwise, I may need to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,
