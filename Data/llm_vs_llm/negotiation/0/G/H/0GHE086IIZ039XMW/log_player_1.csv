Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $1,200,000, which represents excellent value given its quality and potential benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I believe the product has potential, $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer because:
1. Bob's offer of $600,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 (John's offer)
2. Since Bob is negotiating, there's potential to reach a higher price than John's $800,000
3. The fact that Bob made a counteroffer shows he's interested in the product

I'll make a new counteroffer at a lower price than my initial offer but still well above John's price.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $600,000 is too low for this product's value. I can reduce my initial price to $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a significant gap for me. To be honest, my budget for this product is closer to $800000. If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to purchase immediately. Otherwise, I may need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

I choose to sell to John because:
1. Bob's offer of $700,000 is still below John's guaranteed $800,000
2. Bob's message indicates his maximum budget is around $800,000, suggesting we're unlikely to negotiate much higher
3. While Bob might accept a slightly higher counteroffer, there's risk in continuing negotiations when we have a guaranteed $800,000 offer from John
4. The opportunity cost of continuing negotiations isn't worth the potential marginal gain, especially when we have a sure deal at a price above our minimum acceptable value"
