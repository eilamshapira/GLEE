Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. I know the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000. When dealing with Bob, I should aim higher since there's no downside - if he rejects, I still get $8,000 from John.

I'll set a price significantly higher than my minimum, but not so high that it would immediately be rejected. I'll try $12,000, which gives Bob room to still benefit if the product is worth more to him, while giving me a substantial premium over my guaranteed alternative.
