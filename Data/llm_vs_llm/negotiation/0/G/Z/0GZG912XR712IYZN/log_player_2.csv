"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be really interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for a price of... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer against my alternatives.

Alice is offering the product for $200, which is $50 more than the product is worth to me (since the product is worth no more than $150 to me).

John is offering the same product for $150, which is exactly the maximum value I place on the product.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, I should choose the option that gives me the product at the lowest price. In this case, that would be buying from John for $150 rather than accepting Alice's offer of $200.
