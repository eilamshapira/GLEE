"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $120 is quite high for me as I can get the same product from John for $100. I value a good business relationship and would like to make a deal with you. Would you consider selling it for $80? This would allow you to make a quick sale, and I'd be happy to work with you again in the future.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me and value our potential business relationship. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'd like to propose a price of $110, which I believe is more reasonable considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you!",110.0,Alice,3,
