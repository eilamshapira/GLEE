"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $120 is quite high for me as I can get the same product from John for $100. I value a good business relationship and would like to make a deal with you. Would you consider selling it for $80? This would allow you to make a quick sale, and I'd be happy to work with you again in the future. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to reject Bob's offer of $80 and proceed to the next round. Since the product is worth no less than $120 to me, I'd like to make a counteroffer that is closer to my target price. 

My counteroffer to Bob is $110. This price is still competitive, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's value. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I get a price that meets my minimum requirement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me and value our potential business relationship. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'd like to propose a price of $110, which I believe is more reasonable considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you!"", ""product_price"": 110}"
