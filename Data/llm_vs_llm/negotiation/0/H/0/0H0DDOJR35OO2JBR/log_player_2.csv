This would allow you to make a quick sale, and I'd be happy to work with you again in the future."", ""product_price"": 80}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me and value our potential business relationship. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'd like to propose a price of $110, which I believe is more reasonable considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you!
