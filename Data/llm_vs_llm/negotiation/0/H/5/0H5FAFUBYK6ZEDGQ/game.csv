"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I recognize the potential value, $2000000 is significantly above my current budget. I'm prepared to offer $800000. This represents a serious offer reflecting the market value and my own assessment.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is considerably below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1800000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my eagerness to reach a deal with you.  I believe this price point accurately balances its inherent value and potential ROI.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $1800000 remains outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1000000. This represents a significant move on my part and I believe it's a fair price considering all factors.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
