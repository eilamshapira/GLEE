"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $15000 is significantly above my budget. Based on my research and the product's features, I value it at around $6000. I understand you may have your own valuation, but I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $15000 may be out of your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $6000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is still outside my budget. I should mention that I've found the same product from another seller for $8000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. To meet you more than halfway from my initial offer, I can go up to $7000. This represents a substantial increase from my initial offer while still fitting within my budget constraints.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for sharing the information about the other seller and for increasing your offer to $7000. I appreciate your transparency and willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to get a better price for the product. Considering you've found a similar product for $8000 and you're willing to pay a bit more to do business with me, I'm willing to slightly reduce my previous offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11500.0,Alice,5,
