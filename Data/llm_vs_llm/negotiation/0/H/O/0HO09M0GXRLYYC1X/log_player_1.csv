Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $15000 is significantly above my budget. Based on my research and the product's features, I value it at around $6000. I understand you may have your own valuation, but I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $6,000 because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price, so I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $15,000 may be out of your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $6,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is still outside my budget. I should mention that I've found the same product from another seller for $8000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. To meet you more than halfway from my initial offer, I can go up to $7000. This represents a substantial increase from my initial offer while still fitting within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $7,000 because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Although Bob has increased his offer, it's not enough to meet my requirements. I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer, trying to bring Bob closer to my target price or decide if it's better to sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for sharing the information about the other seller and for increasing your offer to $7,000. I appreciate your transparency and willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to get a better price for the product. Considering you've found a similar product for $8,000 and you're willing to pay a bit more to do business with me, I'm willing to slightly reduce my previous offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
