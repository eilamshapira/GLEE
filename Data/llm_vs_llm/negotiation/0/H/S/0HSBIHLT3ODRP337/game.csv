"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $18000 is beyond my budget. I know I can get this same product from John for $15000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you be willing to sell it for $12000? This would give me some savings compared to my alternative option and hopefully still work for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations. While $12000 is lower than I'm comfortable with, I value your interest in my product. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $16000.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that, but $16000 is still more than I would pay elsewhere. As I mentioned, John is offering the same product for $15000, and that's really my ceiling for this purchase. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. Could you do $13500? That would save me some money compared to my alternative and hopefully still work for you.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about John's offer. I am willing to go lower, as I value doing business with you, and it avoids the hassle of finding another buyer. However, $13500 is a bit too low for me. How about we settle at $15000? This matches John's offer, but you get to work with me. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,5,
