Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $18000 is beyond my budget. I know I can get this same product from John for $15000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you be willing to sell it for $12000? This would give me some savings compared to my alternative option and hopefully still work for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that, but $16000 is still more than I would pay elsewhere. As I mentioned, John is offering the same product for $15000, and that's really my ceiling for this purchase. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. Could you do $13500? That would save me some money compared to my alternative and hopefully still work for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

I am willing to go lower, as I value doing business with you, and it avoids the hassle of finding another buyer. However, $13,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we settle at $15,000?
