"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value and potential for you. I'm offering it to you for $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I notice that Alice's offer of $18,000 is actually higher than the maximum value the product is worth to me ($15,000) and also higher than John's guaranteed price of $15,000. It doesn't make financial sense to accept this offer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $18,000 is beyond my budget. I know I can get this same product from John for $15,000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you be willing to sell it for $12,000? This would give me some savings compared to my alternative option and hopefully still work for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations. While $12000 is lower than I'm comfortable with, I value your interest in my product. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $16000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $16,000 is still higher than John's price of $15,000, and it's also higher than the maximum value the product is worth to me. It makes more sense to either counter again or go with John's offer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that, but $16,000 is still more than I would pay elsewhere. As I mentioned, John is offering the same product for $15,000, and that's really my ceiling for this purchase. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. Could you do $13,500? That would save me some money compared to my alternative and hopefully still work for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about John's offer. I am willing to go lower, as I value doing business with you, and it avoids the hassle of finding another buyer. However, $13500 is a bit too low for me. How about we settle at $15000? This matches John's offer, but you get to work with me. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has now matched John's price of $15,000, which is exactly my maximum budget for this product. Since the price is now the same as my alternative option, and Alice seems interested in building a business relationship, I might as well accept her offer.
