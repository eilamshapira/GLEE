"Bob, this product represents a significant opportunity for you, given its value to you is $1000000. I'm confident it will meet and exceed your expectations. Let's start the discussion at a price that reflects its true worth.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering the product's inherent value and what would be fair for both of us, I propose we settle at $800000. Let me know if we can work from there.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is the absolute minimum I'd accept, and I have another buyer, John, willing to pay that. Given its value to you is $1000000, I was hoping we could meet closer to that figure. How about we meet in the middle at $900000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
"Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, to ensure a fair balance for both of us, Iâ€™m countering with $850000. Let me know if we can proceed at this rate.",850000.0,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and your need to get closer to what you believe is fair. In the interest of reaching an agreement while still keeping the numbers balanced for both of us, I'm increasing my offer slightly. How about we settle at $875000? I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value for both sides.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're moving in the right direction! $875000 is getting closer, but I'm still leaving money on the table considering you value the product at $1000000. I'm willing to come down a little more. Let's try $890000. That's the lowest I can realistically go.",890000.0,Alice,5,
