(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay, and I have the option to buy from John for the same price, I don't see any benefit in accepting Alice's offer immediately. I'd like to try to negotiate a better price with Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since Alice's initial offer was $1,200,000, I'll start by offering a price that is closer to what I think the product might be worth to Alice, which is $1,000,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer is $1,150,000, which is still higher than I'd like to pay. Since I know that Alice is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000 (its worth to her), I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to make a more reasonable counteroffer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 2, I offered $900,000, and Alice rejected it. Now, Alice has come back with an offer of $1,150,000. To try to meet in the middle, I'll increase my offer, but not by too much. I'll aim for a price that's still below $1,100,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer is $1,100,000, which is getting closer to what I'm willing to pay. However, I still think I can get a better deal. Since Alice has already dropped her price from $1,150,000 to $1,100,000, I'm hoping she'll be willing to come down a bit further.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 5, Alice offered $1,100,000, and I rejected it. My previous offer was $1,000,000, which Alice also rejected. To try to find a mutually acceptable price, I'll increase my offer slightly. I'll aim for a price that's closer to $1,050,000, but still below $1,100,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer is $1,075,000, which is getting very close to what I'm willing to pay. At this point, I'm starting to think that accepting her offer might be the best option, since I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to pay $1,200,000 to John.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 7, Alice offered $1,075,000, and I rejected it. My previous offer was $1,050,000, which Alice also rejected.

I'll increase my offer to $1,062,500, which is roughly the midpoint between my previous offer and Alice's current offer.

At this point, I think it's likely that Alice has made her best offer, and further negotiation may not yield a significantly better price. Considering that I can buy the product from John for $1,200,000, accepting Alice's offer seems like the best option.
