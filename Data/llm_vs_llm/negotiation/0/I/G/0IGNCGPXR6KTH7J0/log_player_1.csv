Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this:
1. The product is worth at least $10,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer of $10,000 from John
3. Bob's valuation is unknown, but if it's higher than $10,000, I should try to capture some of that value
4. Setting the price too high risks rejection, but I have nothing to lose by asking for more than $10,000

I'll offer a price significantly above my reservation price to leave room for good profit while still being potentially acceptable:

{""product_price"": 15000}"
