"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1500000 is significantly above my budget. I know the market value of this product, and I can actually get it from another seller for $1000000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Given that, I can offer you $900000 for the product. This would allow you to complete the sale quickly without further negotiation.",900000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $900000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1350000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and should be within a reasonable range for you, considering the product's worth.",1350000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
