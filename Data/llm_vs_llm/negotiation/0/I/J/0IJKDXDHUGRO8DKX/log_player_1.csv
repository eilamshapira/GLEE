Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1500000 is significantly above my budget. I know the market value of this product, and I can actually get it from another seller for $1000000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Given that, I can offer you $900000 for the product. This would allow you to complete the sale quickly without further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
