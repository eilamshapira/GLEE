"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1500000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire something of high value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price offered by Alice ($1,500,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000). It would not make sense to accept this offer. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer, knowing I can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations with Alice don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I know the market value of this product, and I can actually get it from another seller for $1,000,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Given that, I can offer you $900,000 for the product. This would allow you to complete the sale quickly without further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $900000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1350000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and should be within a reasonable range for you, considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's new offer of $1,350,000 is still significantly above my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000). While Alice did reduce the price, it's still not competitive with John's offer. Given that I can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, and that's exactly my maximum value, it makes the most sense to end negotiations with Alice and take John's offer."
