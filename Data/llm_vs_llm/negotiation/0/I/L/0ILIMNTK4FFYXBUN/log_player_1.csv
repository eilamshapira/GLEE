Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal strategy here.

Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $1,500,000, I can try to get a higher price from Bob. However, if I ask for too much, Bob will likely reject the offer.

I'll offer the product at a moderate premium above the $1,500,000 value.
