"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but 2500000 is above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1000000 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product's value is significantly higher. I am willing to come down, but not that far. How about $2350000?",2350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, 2350000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of 1200000.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best possible deal, and I appreciate your continued interest. However, $1200000 is simply too low. I am getting the offer from Jhon for $1500000 and I need to seriously consider that. To prevent me from selling the product to Jhon, how about $2150000?",2150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you have an offer from John for 1500000, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to pay 2150000 for the product. I'd like to make a counteroffer of 1300000. If you're considering selling to John for 1500000, I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in between.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
