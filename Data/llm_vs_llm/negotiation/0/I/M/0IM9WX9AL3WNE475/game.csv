"Hello Bob, I'm excited about the possibility of you acquiring this product. Its unique qualities and value proposition make it a truly worthwhile investment. I'm initially offering it to you for $17000. I believe this price reflects its market value and the significant benefits it will bring to you.",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $8000.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.  I'm willing to offer you $8000 for it. ",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, accepting $8000 would be significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. Let's try to meet in the middle. How about $16500?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle.  While I do see the value in this product, $16500 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer. I'm still quite a bit away from $10000, but I'm willing to come down further. How about we try $16000? That's the lowest I can realistically go at this stage.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to find a price that works for both of us.  While I understand your need to make a profit, I'm still only willing to go up to $11000.  If you're not able to come down closer to that, I'm going to have to look at other options.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $15750. This is a significant reduction and really pushes the boundaries of what I can accept. I hope you see this as a serious attempt to reach an agreement.",15750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, $15750 is still too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $11000.  If you're not willing to go lower than that, I'm going to have to move on.",11000.0,Bob,8,
