"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be beneficial for you. I'm offering it to you for $90. This is a premium product that I'm confident will provide good value. Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I have another buyer ready to purchase it at a different price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $80 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $90
3. John is willing to sell it for $80
4. Alice's price ($90) is higher than both:
   - The value I place on the product ($80)
   - John's offering price ($80)

Since Alice's price ($90) is higher than the product's value to me ($80), accepting her offer would mean I'm paying more than what the product is worth to me. Additionally, I can get the same product from John for $80, which matches my valuation.

The rational decision would be to buy from John at $80, as this:
- Saves me $10 compared to Alice's offer
- Matches my maximum valuation of the product
- Ensures I get the product I need
