"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think you'll really like it. I'm willing to let it go for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me think about this:
1. My maximum value for the product is $80
2. Alice's offer of $150 is clearly too high
3. I can buy from John for $80, but let me try negotiating with Alice first
4. Since we have 10 rounds, there's room for negotiation

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's below my maximum value but leaves room for negotiation:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $150 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I can offer you $60 for the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice came down from $150 to $120, showing some flexibility
2. However, $120 is still well above my maximum value of $80
3. We have several rounds left for negotiation
4. I can always buy from John for $80 if negotiations fail
5. No reason to accept an offer above my maximum value

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still stay below my maximum value:

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $120 is still more than I can spend. I can go up to $70. That's a fair price for this product."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'm dropping the price again. How about $100? This is the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let's evaluate the situation:
1. Alice has dropped from $150 to $100, showing significant movement
2. However, $100 is still above my maximum value of $80
3. Alice says this is ""the best she can do""
4. I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $80
5. Even if we continue negotiating, it seems unlikely Alice will go below $80
6. It's time to exercise my alternative option with John

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
