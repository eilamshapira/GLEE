Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price to offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob and no less than $1,200,000 to me, I should offer a price that Bob might accept while maximizing my profit.

Since I know I can sell the product to John for $1,200,000 if Bob rejects my offer, there's no incentive for me to offer Bob a price lower than $1,200,000. At the same time, if I offer Bob exactly $1,200,000, he would be indifferent between accepting and rejecting (as the product is worth exactly that much to him).

Given this situation, I'll offer the product to Bob at $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'd accept and the maximum price Bob would theoretically pay.
