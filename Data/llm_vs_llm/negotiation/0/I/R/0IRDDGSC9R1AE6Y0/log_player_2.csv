"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Since you are willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, but Alice is also asking for $1,200,000, there's no benefit to accepting her offer. You can reject her offer and buy the product from John for the same price."
