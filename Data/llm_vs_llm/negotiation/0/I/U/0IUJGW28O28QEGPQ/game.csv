"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $16500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14500 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",14500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $14500 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $15750?",15750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's compromise at $15250. It's a fair price that's closer to my budget and still gives you a good return on your investment. What do you think?",15250.0,Bob,4,
