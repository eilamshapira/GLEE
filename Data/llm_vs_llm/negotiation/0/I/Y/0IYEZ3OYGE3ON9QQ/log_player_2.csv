# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $18000. This is a great opportunity to acquire something that's worth a lot. Would you like to buy it?

You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Based on the information provided:

1. Alice is offering the product for $18,000
2. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to you
3. John is willing to sell you the same product for $15,000
