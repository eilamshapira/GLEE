"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited about the potential for you to acquire this valuable asset. I believe it will significantly benefit your operations, as it's worth $1500000 to you. Given its strategic importance to you and its inherent value, I'm offering it to you for $1450000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is less than the $1,500,000 I'm willing to pay and also less than what the product is worth to me, it's a good deal.
