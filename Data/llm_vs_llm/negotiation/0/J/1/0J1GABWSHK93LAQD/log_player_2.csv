"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer is $1,000,000, which is the same price as John's offer and equal to the maximum value I'm willing to pay, there's no advantage in accepting Alice's offer. By rejecting, I maintain negotiation leverage and might receive a better offer later. If not, I can still buy from John at the same price."
