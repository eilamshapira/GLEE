"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product. Considering its value, I'm asking $200 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given that the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and John is offering it at exactly $120, Alice's offer of $200 is far too high. Even though I could try to negotiate with Alice, her initial offer is significantly above my maximum value, so it's safer to go with John's guaranteed price.
