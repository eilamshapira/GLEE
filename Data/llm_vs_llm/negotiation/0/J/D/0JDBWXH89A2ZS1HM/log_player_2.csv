"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product that I believe you would really enjoy. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's offer is $100, which is the maximum value I'm willing to pay for the product based on my constraints. However, since this is a negotiation and we have multiple rounds, I should try to get a better price from Alice.

Since John is selling the product for $100 (the same price Alice is offering), I don't need to accept Alice's first offer immediately. I can try to negotiate for a lower price with Alice, knowing I always have John's offer as a backup.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice! Thanks for the offer. While the product sounds interesting, I was hoping to spend a bit less. Would you consider selling it to me for $70? This would help me stay within my budget while still giving you a fair price for your product."", ""product_price"": 70}"
