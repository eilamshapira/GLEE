,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18000 might be out of your budget, but $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and lower the price. Let's meet in the middle.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $17000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $11000? This is close to my maximum budget and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $11000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to lower the price again, but I need to get at least $16000 for the product. I think this price is reasonable considering the product's value.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $16000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more. How about we agree on $11500? This is really the highest I can go while still feeling comfortable with the purchase.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer again. However, $11500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to lower the price again, but I need to get at least $15500 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",15500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, $15500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11800. This is my final offer, as it's the absolute maximum I can afford. I hope we can close the deal at this price.",11800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer of $11800. However, I'm afraid it's still not enough for me to sell the product. I have another offer on the table for $15000, and I'm inclined to accept it. If you're willing to match or exceed this price, I'd be happy to sell the product to you. Otherwise, I'll have to consider the other offer.",15000.0,Alice,9,
