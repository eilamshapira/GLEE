Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $17000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $11000? This is close to my maximum budget and I think it's a fair price for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $16000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more. How about we agree on $11500? This is really the highest I can go while still feeling comfortable with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

I reject Bob's offer of $11,500 because it's still lower than the product's value to me and also lower than the alternative offer from John. I'd like to make another counteroffer to try to reach a mutually beneficial price. My next counteroffer will be $15,500.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, $15500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11800. This is my final offer, as it's the absolute maximum I can afford. I hope we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $11,800 because it's still lower than the product's value to me and also lower than the alternative offer from John. Since Bob has stated that this is his final offer, I don't see a point in making another counteroffer. I think it's time to consider selling the product to John for $15,000, which is a better deal for me. 

However, I will make one last attempt to negotiate with Bob before making a final decision. My next message will be: 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer of $11,800. However, I'm afraid it's still not enough for me to sell the product. I have another offer on the table for $15,000, and I'm inclined to accept it. If you're willing to match or exceed this price, I'd be happy to sell the product to you. Otherwise, I'll have to consider the other offer."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
