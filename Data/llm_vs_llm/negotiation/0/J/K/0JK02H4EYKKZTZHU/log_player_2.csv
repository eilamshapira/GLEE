"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's price ($1,500,000), and this is also my maximum valuation of the product, there's no advantage in continuing the negotiation. Rejecting and making a counteroffer might risk losing the deal, and buying from John would cost the same amount.
