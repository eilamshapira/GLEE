,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $50. Would you be willing to consider that?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $50 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and yours, so how about $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but I can't go that low. To be honest, I have another offer for $150.  I'd rather sell it to you, but I need to get a fair price. How about $115? That's my final offer.",115.0,Alice,5,
