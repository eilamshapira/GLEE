"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer ($150) is higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100), it wouldn't make sense to accept it. Also, since John is offering a guaranteed price of $100, which equals my maximum value, it would be better to buy from John rather than risk a negotiation with Alice that might not result in a better price.
