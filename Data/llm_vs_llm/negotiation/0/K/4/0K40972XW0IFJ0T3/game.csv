"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but would only be able to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest, but $125 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that $200 might be too high for you, but I think $125 is a bit too low. Let's meet in the middle at $162.5. What do you think?",162.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $162.5 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. How about we settle on $140? It's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $140 is still too low for me. How about we settle for $150? It's a fair price that works for both of us.",150.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've reconsidered my offer to meet your price point.  I really want to make this deal, but I can only go as low as $155. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us. ",155.0,Alice,5,
