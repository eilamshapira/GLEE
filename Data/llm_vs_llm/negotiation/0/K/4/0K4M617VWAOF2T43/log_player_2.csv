"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at $120, which I think is a fair price considering its features and quality. Would you like to purchase it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $80 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $120
3. John is offering the same product for $80
4. Alice's price ($120) is significantly higher than both:
   - My maximum valuation ($80)
   - John's alternative offer ($80)

Since Alice's price is $40 higher than my maximum valuation and John's offer, it wouldn't be rational to accept Alice's offer. The best decision would be to buy from John.
