"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will greatly benefit you. I'm offering it to you for $11000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'll analyze this situation:

- The product is worth up to $12,000 to me (Bob)
- Alice is offering it for $11,000
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $12,000
- My goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible

Alice's offer ($11,000) is $1,000 cheaper than John's price ($12,000). Since the product is worth up to $12,000 to me, and Alice's offer is below that value, I should accept Alice's offer to save money.
