"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe you'll find invaluable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $900,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000), there's no reason to accept this offer or continue negotiating. The rational decision is to buy from John.
