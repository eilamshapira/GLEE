"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18500 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. However, $8000 is significantly below the product's value. I can offer it to you for $16000, which is a considerable reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects the product's quality and market value.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the lower price, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $12000? I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle. However, since I have another buyer willing to pay $12000, I would need a better offer to make this deal work. I can come down to $14000, which is still a good value for this product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but I'm still interested in this product. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it. If you're serious about selling, I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,6,
