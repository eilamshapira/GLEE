"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value you believe the product holds, I am looking at a budget a bit below your asking price. I would be willing to offer $1200000 for it. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1200000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to accept $1350000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
