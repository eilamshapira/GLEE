Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $95. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep within my budget. How about $85? I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since the product is worth $100 to Bob and my minimum is $80, I can try to negotiate for a better price than $85. While $85 is above my minimum, there's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $85 is a bit low considering the product's value. I can come down to $90, which I think is a fair compromise and still gives you great value for the product."", ""product_price"": 90}"
