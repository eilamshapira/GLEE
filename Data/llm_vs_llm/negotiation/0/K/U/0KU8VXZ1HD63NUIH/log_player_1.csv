"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a competitive price."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I believe a fair price for the product would be $900000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $900,000 is below my target price and I believe I can get a better deal. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is an option, but I'd like to explore the possibility of getting an even better price from Bob or negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you think the price is a bit high, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'll meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
