"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth a lot more to me than to Bob. This creates room for negotiation and hopefully gets Bob thinking seriously about the value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss.  It's time to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000. This is still a good deal for me considering my minimum value and leaves room for further negotiation with Bob.  Hopefully, this counteroffer encourages a more reasonable response from him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough. I'm confident I can get a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but only to $1,000,000.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable selling price for myself. This should encourage Bob to make a more substantial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, $775,000 is still too low.  I'm not willing to accept that loss.  It's time to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $950,000. This is a significant compromise but still leaves me with a healthy profit. It's getting close to the point where I may consider selling to John, but I want to see if I can get Bob to meet me halfway first."
