Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, I have to decide what to do. Bob's offer is too low. I have to make a decision:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","This is a tough spot. $75 is still below what I'd ideally like, but I also don't want to lose out on a sale. I also know John is waiting with an offer of $80. I need to evaluate the probability of Bob making a better offer than $75. Considering Bob values the product at $100, I'll try one more round.
