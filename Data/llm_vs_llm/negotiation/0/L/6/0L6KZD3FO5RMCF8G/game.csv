"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $135? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant about $135, but I'm getting closer. How about we meet in the middle again? I'd be willing to pay $127.50. Let me know if that works for you.",127.5,Bob,4,
