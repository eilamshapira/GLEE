"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $60 is too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. How about $140?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and John's price. How about $70?",70.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $70 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I can come down to $130, but that's as low as I can go.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your honesty about your minimum acceptable price. However, $130 is still quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Considering John's offer is $80, I'm willing to pay a bit more to buy from you, but not that much more. How about $75?",75.0,Bob,6,
