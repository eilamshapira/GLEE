"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $9500 is quite high for me. Given the market conditions, I'd be comfortable with $8500, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $8500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me partway, Alice. Your movement on the price shows we can work together. I can move up from my previous offer - how about $8700? This gives you a solid profit margin while still being a fair price for the product.",8700.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but $8700 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. To be frank, I have another potential buyer interested at a slightly lower price point.  However, I value our conversation and believe we can reach an agreement. Would you consider $8900?",8900.0,Alice,5,
