Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my price offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price, I should set my price to Bob higher than this amount to potentially maximize my profit.

I'll offer Bob a price that gives me a reasonable profit margin while still being potentially attractive to him:

{""product_price"": 2,200,000}"
