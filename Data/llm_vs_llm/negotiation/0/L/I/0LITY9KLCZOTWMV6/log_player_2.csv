"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's offer ($800,000), it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. The best decision is to buy from John.
