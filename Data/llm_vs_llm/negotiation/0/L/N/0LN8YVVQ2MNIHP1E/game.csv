"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $500000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $500000 is too low considering the product's value. I can come down to $1800000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a fair price given the product's quality and market value. Would this work for you?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1800000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I could potentially go up to $650000, but that's my absolute limit. It's a fair offer considering my budget. What do you say?",650000.0,Bob,4,
