Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $500000 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. $500,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price, considering I can get $1,000,000 from John. However, I'll try one more negotiation round with Bob before considering selling to John.

{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $500,000 is too low considering the product's value.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1800000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I could potentially go up to $650000, but that's my absolute limit. It's a fair offer considering my budget. What do you say?

I'll sell to John. Bob's offer of $650,000 is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000. Given that Bob's second offer only increased by $150,000, it seems unlikely that he'll reach a price point that would exceed John's offer. It's more profitable to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John rather than continue negotiations that may not lead to a better outcome."
