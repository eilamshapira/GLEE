"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000, and I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I will also not sell to John immediately, as there's a possibility that Bob might increase his offer in subsequent rounds. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

My counteroffer to Bob is $1,800,000."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $700,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000, and I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. At this point, Bob has increased his offer from $600,000 to $700,000, but it's still not close enough to my desired price range. I will reject Bob's offer again and consider making another counteroffer, but I will also keep in mind the option to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob do not improve significantly.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

My next counteroffer to Bob is $1,500,000."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $750,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000, and I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. Although Bob has been increasing his offer, the pace of increase is slow, and we are still far from my desired price. Considering the gap between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price, and the fact that I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 with John, I will choose to sell the product to John.
