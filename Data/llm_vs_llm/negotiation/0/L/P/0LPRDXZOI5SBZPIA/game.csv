"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2500000. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm open to negotiations if you have a different valuation in mind.",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product,  $2500000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the market value of similar products, I'm willing to offer $1200000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1200000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to accept.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $2200000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm comfortable going up to $1800000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can make a deal.",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. Considering your offer of $1800000, I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $2000000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair value for the product.",2000000.0,Alice,5,
