"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a product that I believe will be quite valuable to your operations. Given the market value and the potential benefits for your business, I'm offering it at $1300000. This price represents an excellent value considering the product's worth of $1500000 to you, while still providing you with $200000 in immediate value. Would you like to proceed with this offer?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. After reviewing my budget and considering the product's fit for my operations, I can only commit to spending $1000000 on it. I believe this figure reflects a fair balance between the value to you and my current constraints. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1000000 is the absolute minimum value of this product to me, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay that amount. Given that this product is worth $1500000 to you, my offer of $1300000 already provides you with $200000 in value. I'm willing to adjust my price to $1250000, which would give you $250000 in immediate value while still allowing me a reasonable return. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both. Would you consider this revised offer?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
