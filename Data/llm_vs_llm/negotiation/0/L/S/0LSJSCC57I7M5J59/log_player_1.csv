Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. After reviewing my budget and considering the product's fit for my operations, I can only commit to spending $1000000 on it. I believe this figure reflects a fair balance between the value to you and my current constraints. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,000,000 is the absolute minimum value of this product to me, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay that amount. Given that this product is worth $1,500,000 to you, my offer of $1,300,000 already provides you with $200,000 in value. I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,250,000, which would give you $250,000 in immediate value while still allowing me a reasonable return. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both. Would you consider this revised offer?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
