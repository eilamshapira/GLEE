"Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $900000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree once you see the value it can bring.  How about we meet in the middle at $1000000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and ensures a successful transaction.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
