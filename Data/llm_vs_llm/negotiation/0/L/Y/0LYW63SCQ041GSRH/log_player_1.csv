"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $900000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree once you see the value it can bring.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and ensures a successful transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
