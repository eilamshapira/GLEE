"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1100000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if Alice can lower her price. The product is worth $1,000,000 to me, so I'd like to get it for that price or lower.

Counteroffer: $900,000"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $900,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree once you see the value it can bring.  How about we meet in the middle at $1000000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and ensures a successful transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is still not low enough for me. Since John is willing to sell the product for the same price, I'll buy it from him instead."
