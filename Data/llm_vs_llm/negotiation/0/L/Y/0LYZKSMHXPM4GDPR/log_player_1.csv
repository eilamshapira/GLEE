Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has tremendous value, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects its worth. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 5000000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $5000000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the minimum value I have for the product, and selling it to John would also be for $1,000,000, I don't see a benefit in accepting Bob's offer over selling to John or trying to negotiate further with Bob. However, I believe there's potential for Bob to pay more than $1,000,000, so I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try and increase the price.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1,000,000. I understand that $5,000,000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise and lower my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle - I can offer you the product for $3,000,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I hope it's more in line with what you're looking for."", ""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price to $3000000, but it's still above what I can afford. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $1100000. This is close to my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. Let me know if you can accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob has increased his offer to $1,100,000, which is still below my desired price but getting closer. Since selling to John would only get me $1,000,000, accepting Bob's offer would at least get me $100,000 more. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation, and Bob might be willing to pay more. But considering the increase is only $100,000 from his previous offer, I'm not confident that further negotiation will significantly increase the price. Given the options, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best choice to ensure I get a higher price than selling to John.
