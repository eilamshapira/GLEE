"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider my options carefully here. Alice is offering the product for $140, while John is selling it for $150. The product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.

Given that:
- Alice's current offer is $140
- John's fixed price is $150
- I want to save as much money as possible
- I have 10 rounds of negotiation available

It makes sense to reject Alice's first offer and make a counteroffer, since I can always fall back to John's option later if negotiations don't progress well.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has come down to $120 from her initial $140 offer. We're making progress, but I think there's still room for negotiation. The product is worth $80 to her, so there's potential for a price closer to $100. Since we still have 5 more rounds of negotiation left after this one, I'll continue negotiating.
