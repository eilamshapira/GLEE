"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $700000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand budget constraints can be challenging. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer the product to you for $850000. Let me know what you think about this adjusted price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering I can buy the product from John for $800000, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $775000. If we can meet at this price, I'd be happy to make the purchase from you.",775000.0,Bob,4,
