Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider the value ranges here. The product is worth $12,000 to me and $15,000 to Bob, so there's a $3,000 surplus that we could potentially split. I should aim for a price that gives me a good portion of this surplus while still being acceptable to Bob.

I'll start with an offer that's above my reservation price but below Bob's maximum value:

{""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $12,800 gives me $800 more than my alternative option of selling to John at $12,000. However, I think there's still room to negotiate for a better price since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll come down from my initial offer but still try to capture more of the surplus than Bob's last offer provided.

{""product_price"": 13500}"
