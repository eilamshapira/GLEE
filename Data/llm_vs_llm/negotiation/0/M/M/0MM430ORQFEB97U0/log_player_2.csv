"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me think about this strategically:

1. My maximum value for the product is $15,000
2. Alice's offer is $14,000, which is below my maximum
3. I know the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation
4. John's price ($15,000) is higher than Alice's current offer, so that's not a good option

Since Alice's offer is above her cost ($12,000), but still significantly below my maximum value, I should try to negotiate for a better price. There's potential to save more money by making a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's above Alice's cost ($12,000) but significantly lower than her initial offer ($14,000) to leave room for negotiation:

{""product_price"": 12800}

This offer is reasonable because:
1. It's above Alice's cost of $12,000, so she can still make a profit
2. It represents a significant reduction from her initial $14,000 offer
3. It's well below my maximum value of $15,000, giving me good savings
4. Even if Alice counters back, we have room to meet somewhere in the middle"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $14,000 to $13,500, showing willingness to negotiate
2. The new offer represents a $500 reduction from her initial price
3. There might still be room for negotiation, but Alice is likely expecting us to meet somewhere in the middle
4. My last offer was $12,800, and she's now at $13,500
5. The difference between our positions has narrowed significantly
6. John's price ($15,000) remains the worst option

While I could try another counteroffer, Alice has made a significant concession, and the current price of $13,500 represents a good value compared to my maximum value of $15,000. Further negotiation might risk souring the deal for relatively small additional savings.
