"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. If you're interested, please consider my offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'm considering Alice's offer for the product at $100, but I need to compare it with my other options. 

According to the information provided, the product is worth no more than $80 to me. John is willing to sell me the same product for $80, which matches my maximum valuation.

Alice's offer of $100 exceeds what the product is worth to me, and it's also $20 more than John's offer. There's no reason for me to pay more than the product's value to me or more than what another seller is charging.
