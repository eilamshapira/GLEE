"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Accepting Alice's offer means you'll pay the full $1,500,000, which is the same price as buying from John.
* Rejecting Alice's offer means you have the opportunity to negotiate with Alice or potentially find a better deal elsewhere. 
*  There's no benefit to buying from John immediately, as you can at least try to negotiate with Alice."
