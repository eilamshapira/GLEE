Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000}

Explanation (not part of the offer format):
I'm offering the product at $1,000,000 because:
1. This is the minimum value acceptable to me
2. If Bob rejects this offer, I can sell to John for the same amount
3. Even though the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, offering a lower price would reduce my profit without any benefit
4. There's no incentive for me to offer a lower price since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000"
