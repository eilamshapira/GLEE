"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you have a budget in mind, but I need to be transparent - this product is worth at least $12000 to me, which is actually what another buyer (John) is willing to pay right now. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. Given the product's quality and value, my best offer is $12500. This is already below what I could get elsewhere, but I'm offering it to you first because I value our potential business relationship.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your transparency and the value you see in the product. However, my budget is limited and I can offer a maximum of $9000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I hope it shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
