"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe will be immensely valuable for you. I'm offering it to you for $11500. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the initial offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to do $10,500? I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. The value of this product is quite high, and I'm confident it's worth the investment. How does $11000 sound to you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is closer to Bob's target of saving money. While he could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might walk away or increase the price again.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a price that is still lower than John's offer."
