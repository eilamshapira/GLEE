"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. I know it's a valuable asset and I believe this price reflects its worth. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Reasoning: The product is worth $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $950,000 is very close to my maximum budget. However, since I know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I believe there is room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, I'm hoping to get a better price from her or explore other options. Buying from John for $1,000,000 is still an option, but I'd like to try to get a better deal from Alice first."
