"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. How about we settle on $120? Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth more than $120. How about we meet in the middle at $160? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a fair price for the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $160 is still a bit high for me. Could we go for $130? I think that's a fair price considering my budget constraints.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price to $130. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $150. It's still a discount from my original price, but it's more in line with the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",150.0,Alice,5,
