"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. How about we settle on $120? Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since the product is worth no less than $120 to me, and Bob's offer is exactly $120, I could consider accepting it. However, I also have the option to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob or sell it to John for the same price. Given that I have 9 more rounds to negotiate and the goal is to earn as much money as I can, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth more than $120. How about we meet in the middle at $160? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $160 is still a bit high for me. Could we go for $130? I think that's a fair price considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer of $130 is slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, and it shows that he's willing to negotiate and increase his offer. However, I still have the goal of earning as much money as I can, and I have 6 more rounds to negotiate. Since Bob's offer is only $10 more than my minimum acceptable price, I'll choose to reject his offer and try to get a better price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price to $130. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $150. It's still a discount from my original price, but it's more in line with the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 150}"
