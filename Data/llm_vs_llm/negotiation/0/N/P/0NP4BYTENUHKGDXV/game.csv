"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value, I believe a starting price of $2200000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $2200000 is significantly above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and the product's features, I can offer $1200000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. I hope we can work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber. You've already acknowledged its significant value. How about we meet in the middle at $1850000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down in price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be transparent that I have another offer from John for this exact product at $1500000. Since that's my absolute maximum budget for this item, I can't go above that amount. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $1350000, which would save me some money while still providing you with a substantial amount. This would be beneficial for both of us - I get a better deal than my alternative, and you make a sale today rather than losing it to your competitor.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems we're getting closer. While I understand your position, and your mention of John's offer, the value of this product is undeniable. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1700000. This allows for a small concession on my end while still reflecting the true value of what you're getting.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
