Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $2200000 is significantly above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and the product's features, I can offer $1200000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. I hope we can work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down in price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be transparent that I have another offer from John for this exact product at $1500000. Since that's my absolute maximum budget for this item, I can't go above that amount. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $1350000, which would save me some money while still providing you with a substantial amount. This would be beneficial for both of us - I get a better deal than my alternative, and you make a sale today rather than losing it to your competitor. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,700,000. This allows for a small concession on my end while still reflecting the true value of what you're getting."",
