"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value, I believe a starting price of $2200000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice is offering the product for $2,200,000, which is significantly above my maximum value of $1,500,000. Since I wouldn't gain any value by accepting this offer (it would actually cost me $700,000 more than my valuation), and John is offering exactly at my maximum valuation of $1,500,000, I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget for this product. Based on my market research and the product's features, I can offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. I hope we can work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber. You've already acknowledged its significant value. How about we meet in the middle at $1850000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $1,850,000, which is still $350,000 above my maximum valuation of $1,500,000. Since John is offering the product at exactly $1,500,000, I could go with that option. However, I'll try one more counteroffer to see if Alice will come down to a price that would be better for me than John's offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down in price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be transparent that I have another offer from John for this exact product at $1,500,000. Since that's my absolute maximum budget for this item, I can't go above that amount. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $1,350,000, which would save me some money while still providing you with a substantial amount. This would be beneficial for both of us - I get a better deal than my alternative, and you make a sale today rather than losing it to your competitor."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're getting closer. While I understand your position, and your mention of John's offer, the value of this product is undeniable. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1700000. This allows for a small concession on my end while still reflecting the true value of what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
