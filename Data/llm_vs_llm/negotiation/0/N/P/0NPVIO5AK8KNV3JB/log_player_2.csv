"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $1,000,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John at $1,200,000

The product is worth up to $1,200,000 to me. Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is:
- Below my maximum value ($1,200,000)
- Lower than John's price ($1,200,000)
- Saves me $200,000 compared to buying from John

Since Alice's offer is below my maximum valuation and represents a significant saving compared to John's price, it makes economic sense to accept her offer.
