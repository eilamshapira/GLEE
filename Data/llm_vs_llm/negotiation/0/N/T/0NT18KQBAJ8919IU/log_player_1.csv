"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","$850,000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and since we're only in round 2 of 10, there's room to negotiate for a better price. Bob's willingness to pay $850,000 shows there's potential to reach a higher price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let me make a counteroffer of $925,000."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","$900,000 is a good offer, representing a significant improvement from Bob's previous offer of $850,000. While it's not the maximum possible price, it's a substantial profit above my minimum of $800,000, and we've already gone through 4 rounds. The risk of pushing too hard might lead Bob to reduce his offer or walk away, in which case I'd have to settle for John's $800,000. It's better to secure this good deal now.
