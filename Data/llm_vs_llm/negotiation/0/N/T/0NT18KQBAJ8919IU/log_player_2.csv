It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a price that's closer to Alice's perceived value.  It's a significant discount from her first offer, but still leaves some room for compromise."
