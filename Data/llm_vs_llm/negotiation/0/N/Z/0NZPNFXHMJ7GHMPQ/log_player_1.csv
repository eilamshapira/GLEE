Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider the optimal price to offer Bob for the product. The product is worth at least $12,000 to me, and I already have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I need to balance setting a price high enough to maximize my profit while not making it so high that Bob rejects my offer.

Given that I have a safety net of $12,000 from John, I can afford to set a somewhat aggressive price for Bob. I'll offer a price that gives me a significant premium over my guaranteed option.
