"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $10,000 is a good price, there's a chance Alice might be willing to go even lower. It's worth seeing if we can negotiate a better deal before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer allows room for negotiation.  It will give us an idea of Alice's bottom line and how flexible she might be."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice reducing her price suggests some flexibility. We're still far away from our fallback option of John, so it's worth negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show willingness to compromise, but still aiming for a price significantly below Alice's current offer."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is steadily coming down, indicating a potential to reach an even better deal. We still have room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Meeting Alice halfway between her last offer and my last counteroffer seems like a fair move at this stage. It keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a lower price."
