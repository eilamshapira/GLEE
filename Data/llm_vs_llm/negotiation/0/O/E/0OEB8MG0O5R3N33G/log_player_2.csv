# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I hope you're doing well. I would like to offer this product to you at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150

Alice is starting at her top price, which is more than you're willing to pay. You can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no need to negotiate with Alice."
