Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $10,000 to Bob
2. My minimum acceptable price is $8,000 (as I can sell to John for this amount)
3. Bob will accept if he gets any value from the deal (price less than $10,000)
4. I should set a price that leaves Bob with just enough value to accept

I'll offer slightly below $10,000 to give Bob a small incentive to accept while maximizing my profit.
