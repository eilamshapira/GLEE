"Hello Bob, I have a product that is worth $1000000, which I understand is the value it holds for you as well. I'm offering this product to you at a price of $1250000. This is an excellent investment opportunity, as the product will deliver full value to you. I do have another interested buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1000000, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity to acquire this valuable asset. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the first opportunity to acquire this product. While I appreciate the value it holds, $1250000 is more than I am willing to pay. My counteroffer is $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering my own budget constraints.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I must decline. Your offer of $800000 is actually below what I have already been offered by John, who is willing to pay $1000000. Given that the product is worth $1000000 to you as well, I believe a fair price would be $1100000. This still allows you to acquire an asset at a reasonable premium while providing me with a fair return. Please consider that I can sell to John immediately at $1000000, but I'm giving you priority as I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for reconsidering, Alice. Given that John is offering $1000000, I'm willing to match that price. My counteroffer is $1000000. This ensures you receive the same value while honoring our business relationship. I hope we can proceed with this agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
