"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that is worth $1,000,000, which I understand is the value it holds for you as well. I'm offering this product to you at a price of $1,250,000. This is an excellent investment opportunity, as the product will deliver full value to you. I do have another interested buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,000,000, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity to acquire this valuable asset. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the first opportunity to acquire this product. While I appreciate the value it holds, $1250000 is more than I am willing to pay. My counteroffer is $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering my own budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I must decline. Your offer of $800,000 is actually below what I have already been offered by John, who is willing to pay $1,000,000. Given that the product is worth $1,000,000 to you as well, I believe a fair price would be $1,100,000. This still allows you to acquire an asset at a reasonable premium while providing me with a fair return. Please consider that I can sell to John immediately at $1,000,000, but I'm giving you priority as I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for reconsidering, Alice. Given that John is offering $1000000, I'm willing to match that price. My counteroffer is $1000000. This ensures you receive the same value while honoring our business relationship. I hope we can proceed with this agreement.
