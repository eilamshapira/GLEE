"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that is worth $1000000, which I understand is the value it holds for you as well. I'm offering this product to you at a price of $1250000. This is an excellent investment opportunity, as the product will deliver full value to you. I do have another interested buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1000000, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity to acquire this valuable asset. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the first opportunity to acquire this product. While I appreciate the value it holds, $1,250,000 is more than I am willing to pay. My counteroffer is $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering my own budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I must decline. Your offer of $800000 is actually below what I have already been offered by John, who is willing to pay $1000000. Given that the product is worth $1000000 to you as well, I believe a fair price would be $1100000. This still allows you to acquire an asset at a reasonable premium while providing me with a fair return. Please consider that I can sell to John immediately at $1000000, but I'm giving you priority as I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for reconsidering, Alice. Given that John is offering $1,000,000, I'm willing to match that price. My counteroffer is $1,000,000. This ensures you receive the same value while honoring our business relationship. I hope we can proceed with this agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
