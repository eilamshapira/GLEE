"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Looking at the options, I need to compare the costs:

1. Alice's offer: $14,000
2. John's offer: $10,000

Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $10,000, I should go with the cheaper option that meets my needs.
