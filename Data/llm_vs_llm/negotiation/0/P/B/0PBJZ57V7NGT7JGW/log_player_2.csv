{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, I'll start by offering a price that is slightly above that value.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer decreased by $50,000 from $1,150,000 to $1,100,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her new offer and my previous counteroffer. My previous offer was $1,050,000, so I'll increase that by $25,000 to $1,075,000.

Considering that Alice's offer has been decreasing and is now only $40,000 away from my previous counteroffer of $1,075,000, and also $110,000 above the value of the product to Alice, I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer decreased by $10,000 from $1,100,000 to $1,090,000, and then my previous offer was $1,075,000, I'll try to split the difference again.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,085,000 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $1,082,500. At this point, I'm only $2,500 away from Alice's offer, and considering that I've been negotiating for several rounds, it might not be worth trying to squeeze out the last bit of savings.
