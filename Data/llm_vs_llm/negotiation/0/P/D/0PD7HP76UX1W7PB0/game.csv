"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I need to let you know that the product is only worth $100 to me, and I can actually buy it from another seller, John, for exactly $100. I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a reasonable price. Would you be willing to sell it for $90? This would give me a reason to buy from you instead of John.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $105. This gives you a good price and still lets me make a reasonable profit. Let me know if this works for you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate you working with me. However, I still need to point out that John is offering the exact same product for $100, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay based on its value to me. If you can match John's price of $100, I'd be happy to do business with you instead. Otherwise, I'll need to go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
