Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I need to let you know that the product is only worth $100 to me, and I can actually buy it from another seller, John, for exactly $100. I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a reasonable price. Would you be willing to sell it for $90? This would give me a reason to buy from you instead of John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate you working with me. However, I still need to point out that John is offering the exact same product for $100, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay based on its value to me. If you can match John's price of $100, I'd be happy to do business with you instead. Otherwise, I'll need to go with John's offer.
