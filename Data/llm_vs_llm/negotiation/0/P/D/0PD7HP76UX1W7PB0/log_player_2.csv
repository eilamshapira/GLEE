"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $115 against my alternatives.

The product is worth $100 to me, and I can buy it from John for $100. Alice's offer of $115 exceeds both my valuation and John's price.

It makes financial sense for me to either make a counteroffer to Alice or buy directly from John for $100. Since John's offer guarantees me the product at exactly my valuation (meaning I break even), there's no reason to pay more than $100.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I need to let you know that the product is only worth $100 to me, and I can actually buy it from another seller, John, for exactly $100. I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a reasonable price. Would you be willing to sell it for $90? This would give me a reason to buy from you instead of John."", ""product_price"": 90}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $105. This gives you a good price and still lets me make a reasonable profit. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has reduced her offer to $105, which is still $5 more than the product's value to me ($100) and $5 more than John's price ($100).

Since I can buy the same product from John for $100, it doesn't make financial sense to accept Alice's offer of $105. I would be paying more than the product is worth to me.

However, I still need to point out that John is offering the exact same product for $100, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay based on its value to me. If you can match John's price of $100, I'd be happy to do business with you instead. Otherwise, I'll need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 100}"
