Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, and I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80, I should offer Bob a price above $80.

I don't know how much Bob values the product, so I'll choose a price that gives me a reasonable profit margin while still being potentially attractive to a buyer. I'll set my price at $120, which gives me a 50% markup over my minimum acceptable value.
