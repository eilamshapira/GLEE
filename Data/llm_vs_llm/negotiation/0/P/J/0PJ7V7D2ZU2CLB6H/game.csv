"Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unparalleled value and the meticulous care it's received, I'm offering it to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1500000 to me, which is coincidentally the same price John is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product, which would allow you to make a reasonable profit while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thank you for your offer. While I understand your position, I need to ensure a fair return for the product. Given its unique value, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. I counter with an offer of $1800000.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a more reasonable price, but $1800000 is still significantly above what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, John is offering the identical product for $1500000, which is my absolute maximum budget for this purchase. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I need a better price than my alternative. I'm willing to offer $1350000, which gives you a fair return while providing me with some incentive to choose you over John. This seems like a win-win for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thank you again for your continued interest. I understand the need to stay within a certain budget, and I am willing to work with you. Considering your maximum valuation is $1500000, and John's offer is the same, I would like to meet you closer to that price. I will reduce the price and offer it to you for $1650000.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue working with me on the price. However, I need to emphasize that paying above $1500000 simply doesn't make financial sense for me - that's both my maximum valuation and the price John is offering. For me to choose you over John, I need some financial incentive. I'm willing to offer $1450000, which is extremely close to John's price but still gives you a fair return on your product. This is nearly my absolute maximum, but it would allow me to justify doing business with you rather than going with my alternative option.",1450000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position and the need to balance your budget with a good deal. To show my commitment to reaching an agreement, I am willing to further reduce the price. Given your circumstances, I will offer the product to you for $1550000.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for continuing to work with me on reaching a fair agreement. I appreciate that you've reduced your price considerably from your initial offer. However, I must be straightforward: John is offering the exact same product for $1500000, which is already at my maximum budget. For me to choose you as my seller, I need at least a matching price. To close this deal, I'm willing to offer $1500000 - exactly what the product is worth to me and what John is charging. This represents my final offer and would allow us both to walk away satisfied with the transaction.",1500000.0,Bob,8,
