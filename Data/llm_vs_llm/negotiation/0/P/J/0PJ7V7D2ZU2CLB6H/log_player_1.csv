"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unparalleled value and the meticulous care it's received, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1500000 to me, which is coincidentally the same price John is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product, which would allow you to make a reasonable profit while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Considering Bob's offer of $1,200,000 and the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, I will **Reject Bob's offer** and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your offer. While I understand your position, I need to ensure a fair return for the product. Given its unique value, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. I counter with an offer of $1,800,000."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving toward a more reasonable price, but $1800000 is still significantly above what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, John is offering the identical product for $1500000, which is my absolute maximum budget for this purchase. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I need a better price than my alternative. I'm willing to offer $1350000, which gives you a fair return while providing me with some incentive to choose you over John. This seems like a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is tempting, but I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to John. I also know that there are still some rounds remaining and Bob values the product the same as John. I will **Reject Bob's offer** and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thank you again for your continued interest. I understand the need to stay within a certain budget, and I am willing to work with you. Considering your maximum valuation is $1,500,000, and John's offer is the same, I would like to meet you closer to that price. I will reduce the price and offer it to you for $1,650,000."", ""product_price"": 1650000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue working with me on the price. However, I need to emphasize that paying above $1500000 simply doesn't make financial sense for me - that's both my maximum valuation and the price John is offering. For me to choose you over John, I need some financial incentive. I'm willing to offer $1450000, which is extremely close to John's price but still gives you a fair return on your product. This is nearly my absolute maximum, but it would allow me to justify doing business with you rather than going with my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is getting closer to my break-even point, but I know I can get $1,500,000 from John. Given that we're only in round 6, I believe I can still get a better deal from Bob. I will **Reject Bob's offer** and make a counteroffer.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer to Bob:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for continuing to work with me on reaching a fair agreement. I appreciate that you've reduced your price considerably from your initial offer. However, I must be straightforward: John is offering the exact same product for $1500000, which is already at my maximum budget. For me to choose you as my seller, I need at least a matching price. To close this deal, I'm willing to offer $1500000 - exactly what the product is worth to me and what John is charging. This represents my final offer and would allow us both to walk away satisfied with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
