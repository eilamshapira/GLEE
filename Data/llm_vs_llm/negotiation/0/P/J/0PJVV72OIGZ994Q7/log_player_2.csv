"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($10,000) and John's alternative offer ($10,000), it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. The best economic decision would be to buy from John at $10,000.
