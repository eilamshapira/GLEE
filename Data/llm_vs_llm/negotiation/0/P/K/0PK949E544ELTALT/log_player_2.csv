"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $9500. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly below its true value.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $9,500 is below that threshold, it's a good deal. Additionally, rejecting the offer would lead to buying the product from John for $10,000, which is more expensive. Therefore, the best decision is to accept Alice's offer.
