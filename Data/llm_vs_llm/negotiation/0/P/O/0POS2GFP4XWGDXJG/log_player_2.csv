"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since both Alice and John are offering the product at $15,000, and this is exactly the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, there's no advantage in choosing one over the other. I might as well accept Alice's offer since she's already here and made the offer.
