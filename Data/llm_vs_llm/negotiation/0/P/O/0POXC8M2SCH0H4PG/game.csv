"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is well above my budget for this product. I know the same product is available elsewhere for $10000, which is actually the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer you $8500 for the product. This allows you to make a quick sale while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $12000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
