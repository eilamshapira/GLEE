"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is well above my budget for this product. I know the same product is available elsewhere for $10000, which is actually the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer you $8500 for the product. This allows you to make a quick sale while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
