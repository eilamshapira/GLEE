"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for $15000.  This is a one-time offer, don't miss out! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to consider Alice's offer of $15,000 carefully.

The product is worth at most $10,000 to me, and I know John is willing to sell it for exactly $10,000. Alice's offer of $15,000 is $5,000 more than both my maximum valuation and John's price.

There's no reason to accept an offer that's higher than my maximum valuation, especially when I have a guaranteed alternative at a lower price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is well above my budget for this product. I know the same product is available elsewhere for $10,000, which is actually the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer you $8,500 for the product. This allows you to make a quick sale while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $12000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to evaluate Alice's counteroffer of $12,000.

The product is worth at most $10,000 to me, and I can buy it from John for exactly $10,000. Alice's current offer of $12,000 is still $2,000 more than both my maximum valuation and John's price.

Since Alice's offer exceeds the alternative price from John, and is above my maximum valuation, the rational choice is to reject this offer. I could make another counteroffer, but it might be more efficient to simply go with the known alternative.
