Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. The product is worth $100 to Bob, and I have a guaranteed backup offer of $80 from John. I should start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while still being within Bob's value range.

{""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob's offer of $85 is better than John's $80
2. Bob's initial rejection of $95 but counteroffer of $85 shows he's willing to negotiate
3. Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, there might be room to negotiate a bit higher

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob countered with $85, which shows he's willing to pay more than my minimum acceptable price ($80), I'll try to meet somewhere in the middle between his $85 and my initial $95. This should be more acceptable to him while still giving me a better profit.
