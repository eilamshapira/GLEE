Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think of my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a budget. Would you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price. Since Bob's offer is quite low, I'll try to meet him halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. 

My counteroffer: $100"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $120 might be out of your budget, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and find a middle ground. Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 100}"
