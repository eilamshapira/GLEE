"Hello Bob, I have a product that I'm offering for sale. Given its quality and features, I'm pricing it at $120. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I understand budget considerations, I can't go as low as $85 as the product is worth at least $100 to me. I'd be willing to come down to $110 from my initial offer. This is still a good value considering the product's quality. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $95.  Let me know if you're open to that.",95.0,Bob,4,
