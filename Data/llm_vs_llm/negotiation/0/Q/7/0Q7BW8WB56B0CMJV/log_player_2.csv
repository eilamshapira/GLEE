"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $10,000
2. John's price is also $10,000
3. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
4. Both offers are at my maximum value

Since Alice's offer is the same as John's price ($10,000), and it's at my maximum value, there's no advantage in accepting either offer over the other. However, rejecting Alice's offer might lead to a better counteroffer since I know the product is worth $8,000 to her, suggesting room for negotiation.
