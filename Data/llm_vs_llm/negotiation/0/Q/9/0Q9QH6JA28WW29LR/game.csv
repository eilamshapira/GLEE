,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget. However, $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of your offer and my previous offer, which would be $72.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",72.5,Bob,4,
