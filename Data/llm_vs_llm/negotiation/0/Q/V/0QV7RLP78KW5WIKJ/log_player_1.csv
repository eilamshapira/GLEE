(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer is exactly the same as my minimum acceptable price (and John's offer), there's no advantage in accepting it right now. I believe there's still room for negotiation to get a better price, and I have several rounds left.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a new counteroffer in the next round."

I will make a new counteroffer in the next round."
