"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that budget can be a constraint, but I'm afraid $8000 is too low for this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a fair price. I can offer you a slight discount from my initial price, but I still need to get at least closer to its true value.",14000.0,Alice,3,
