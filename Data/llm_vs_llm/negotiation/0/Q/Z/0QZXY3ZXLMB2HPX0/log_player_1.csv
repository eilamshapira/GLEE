Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality you're describing, but my budget is quite tight for this purchase. I can commit to buying the product today for $8000. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that budget can be a constraint, but I'm afraid $8,000 is too low for this product.
