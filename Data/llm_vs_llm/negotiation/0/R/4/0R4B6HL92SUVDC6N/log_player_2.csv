"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you our exclusive product at a special price of $1800000. This is a one-time offer that I believe represents great value for what you're getting. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum budget ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), there's no reason to accept this offer or even continue negotiating with Alice. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, so I should take John's offer.
