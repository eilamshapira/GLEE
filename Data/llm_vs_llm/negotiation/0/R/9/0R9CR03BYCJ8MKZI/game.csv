"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your proposal, I believe we can find a price point that works better for both of us. Given that the product is worth $1000000 to you, I'd like to propose a price of $1200000. This gives you a significant profit of $200000 while still allowing me to save compared to alternative options. Would this work for you?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
