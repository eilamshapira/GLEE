Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your proposal, I believe we can find a price point that works better for both of us. Given that the product is worth $1000000 to you, I'd like to propose a price of $1200000. This gives you a significant profit of $200000 while still allowing me to save compared to alternative options. Would this work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
