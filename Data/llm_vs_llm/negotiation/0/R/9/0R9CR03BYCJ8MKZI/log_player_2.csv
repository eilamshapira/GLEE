"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I would like to offer you the product at a price that captures its value to both of us. Considering your valuation and my own, I am willing to sell it to you for $1400000. This way, we both benefit significantly from the transaction. Let me know if you find this agreeable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,500,000
2. Alice's product is worth $1,000,000 to her
3. Alice's current offer is $1,400,000
4. John's fixed price is $1,500,000

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than John's price ($1,500,000), but there might be room for negotiation since Alice's value is only $1,000,000. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer since:
- It's better than John's price already
- There's a $400,000 gap between Alice's value and her asking price
- I can potentially negotiate a better deal

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable for Alice:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your proposal, I believe we can find a price point that works better for both of us. Given that the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000. This gives you a significant profit of $200,000 while still allowing me to save compared to alternative options. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However, considering the value this product brings and the unique benefits it offers, I believe a more balanced price point would be $1350000. This allows both of us to reach a favorable agreement while taking into account the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. The new offer is $150,000 less than John's price
3. Alice's value is $1,000,000, so she still has room to go lower
4. However, she only came down $50,000 from her initial offer

While I could try another counteroffer, there's a risk that too much negotiation might lead to a breakdown in talks. The current offer of $1,350,000 is significantly better than John's price ($150,000 savings), and we've already achieved some concession from Alice. While there might be room for a bit more negotiation, the current offer represents a good deal that's safely below my maximum value.
