"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm asking for $1500000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be honest that $1500000 is significantly above my budget. The maximum I can afford for this product is $1000000, which I believe is a fair price. I do have an alternative option to purchase from another seller for $1200000, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate. While $1000000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $1250000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair deal. Let's close this transaction and move forward.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate the movement, but I need to be transparent with you. I have a guaranteed option to purchase this same product from another seller for $1200000. For me to choose you as my supplier instead, I would need a better price than that. My offer is $1150000, which would save me money compared to my alternative while giving you a sale. Can we make this work?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued negotiations.  $1150000 is getting closer to where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This will allow you to save money compared to your alternative option, and it will ensure a smooth transaction.  Let's reach an agreement and move forward with this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1200000, which matches my alternative option. However, for me to choose to do business with you rather than my other option, I would need some incentive. I'm offering $1180000 as my final offer. This gives you a guaranteed sale today and gives me a small savings. I believe this is fair for both of us and would allow us to close this deal immediately.",1180000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a slight advantage. While I'm open to negotiation, $1180000 is simply too low for me to accept. To make this deal work, I need to be at least at $1190000. This price reflects the value of the product and ensures we both benefit from this transaction. Let's close this deal and move forward together.",1190000.0,Alice,7,
