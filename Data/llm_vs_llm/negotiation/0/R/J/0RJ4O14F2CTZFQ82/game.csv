"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1200000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $700000 is below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $950000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850000, which is a significant step closer to your offer and within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a compromise at this point.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $900000.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
