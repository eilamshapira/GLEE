"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is a little too low for me.  How about $85?  That's a good price for both of us, and it leaves room for some flexibility in the future.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, $85 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go to $75. How does that sound?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $75, but I'm still looking for a bit more. How about we split the difference and settle on $80? That way, we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Alice,5,
