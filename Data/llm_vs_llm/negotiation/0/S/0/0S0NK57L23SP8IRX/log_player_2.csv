"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is only worth $100 to me and Alice's offer is well above that, I'll start with a low counteroffer to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since I can get the product from John for $100, and the product is only worth $100 to me, there's no reason to accept an offer above $100. I'll reject and try one more counteroffer to see if Alice will go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

I'll offer $90, which leaves some room for profit for Alice while still being below my maximum value of $100. If Alice doesn't accept this, I can always fall back on John's offer of $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer is still above $100 (which is both my maximum value and John's selling price), and Alice seems unwilling to go below $100 based on previous negotiations, the best decision is to buy from John for $100. This guarantees I don't pay more than the product is worth to me."
