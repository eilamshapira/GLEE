"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000, considering I can also get it from John for $12000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in the product, Bob. I appreciate your transparency about your budget. However, I must consider the product's value and the offer from John. I'm willing to compromise, but $10000 is below my expectations. I can offer you a better price than John's, though.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $22000 is still a bit steep for me. Considering John's offer of $12000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and John's price. I'd like to propose $11000 as a serious offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. However, I still believe the product's value exceeds $11000. Considering John's offer, I'm willing to make a more significant concession. I can offer you a price that's closer to John's, but still reflects the product's worth.",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued concessions, Alice. However, $18000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $12000. At this point, I'm willing to make a final serious offer. I'd like to propose $12500, which is just above John's price. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider buying from John.",12500.0,Bob,6,
