Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000, considering I can also get it from John for $12000.

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued concessions, Alice. However, $18000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $12000. At this point, I'm willing to make a final serious offer. I'd like to propose $12500, which is just above John's price. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider buying from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

Given that Bob's final offer is $12,500, which is still below John's offer of $15,000, I have decided to sell the product to John for the higher price. This ensures that I maximize my earnings from the sale."
