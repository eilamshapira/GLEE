Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Considering my options:

*   **Accept Bob's offer:** Profit of $90 - $80 (my cost) = $10
*   **Sell to John:** Profit of $80 - $80 (my cost) = $0
*   **Reject and counteroffer:** This is the most risky option, as Bob might lower the price or walk away, but also has the highest potential profit.

I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 100}"
