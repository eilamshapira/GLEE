"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its features and value, I'm offering it at $250. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $250 is much higher than I can afford. I'm willing to buy the product for $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I can always fall back on John's $150 offer, so there's no reason to accept less than that amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $100 is too low for this product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $150, but I believe this product offers great value for you. I can offer it at $200. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $200 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Would you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob is only offering $110, which is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and his counteroffer only increased by $10, it seems unlikely that we'll reach a price above $150 in the remaining rounds. Therefore, I'll take the guaranteed $150 from John rather than continue negotiating."
