"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is lower than John's price of $15,000 but still seems high considering the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's above Alice's cost ($8,000) but significantly lower than her initial offer of $12,000. This gives room for negotiation while still allowing both parties to benefit.

{""product_price"": 9,500}

This offer gives Alice a $1,500 profit while saving me a significant amount compared to both her initial offer and John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $12,000 to $10,500, which is a much more reasonable price. While we might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice becoming frustrated and potentially raising the price again. The current offer of $10,500 represents a good deal compared to John's price of $15,000, and the savings of $4,500 is substantial. I'll accept this offer.
