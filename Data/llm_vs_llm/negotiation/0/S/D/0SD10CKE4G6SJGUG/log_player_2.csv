"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm offering my premium product for $1200000. It represents exceptional value and quality. Please let me know if you'd like to proceed or discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is well below my maximum value of $1,500,000, and also lower than John's price of $1,500,000. This is a good deal that would save me $300,000 compared to buying from John.
