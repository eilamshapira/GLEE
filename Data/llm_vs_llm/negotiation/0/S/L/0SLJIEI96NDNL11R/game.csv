Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you a rare opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe you'll find extremely valuable. I would like to sell it to you for $20000. Let me know what you think!,20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $5000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, and I understand your budget constraints. However, the value of the product is significantly higher. How about we settle at $17500? I believe this is a fair compromise. Let me know!",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $17500 is still out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6500. I'm trying to meet you halfway, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your patience, Bob. I truly appreciate your counteroffer, but I cannot go that low. How about we try $15000? This is the minimum I can accept, and it allows us to close the deal while still being beneficial for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your understanding, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $15000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering your willingness to compromise, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,6,
