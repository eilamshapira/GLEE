Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. The product is worth $100 to Bob and $80 is my minimum acceptable price. I should start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while still aiming to maximize my profit.

{""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob's offer of $85 is above my minimum acceptable price ($80)
2. It's $5 more than what John is offering ($80)
3. While I could try to counter with a higher price, there's a risk Bob might walk away
4. $85 is a reasonable compromise between Bob's maximum value ($100) and my minimum ($80)

I'll accept Bob's offer since it's a fair price and guarantees me a profit above my minimum threshold.
