"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Considering its value and what it can provide for you, I would like to offer it to you for $14000. This price is a fantastic deal given that I could sell it to another buyer for more. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is a discount from Alice's initial value, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  It makes more sense to see if Alice will lower her price further."
