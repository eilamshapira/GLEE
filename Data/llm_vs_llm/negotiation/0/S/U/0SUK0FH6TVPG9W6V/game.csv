"Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well. I'm offering you a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. Based on my assessment of the market and the product's features, I'm offering it to you for $11000. This is a competitive price for a product of this caliber.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was hoping we could settle on a lower price. How about $9500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. Unfortunately, I can't accept $9500 as that's below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value, and I actually have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $10000 for it. However, I'd prefer to sell it to you if we can reach a fair agreement. Could you consider $10500? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value for a product worth $12000 to the right buyer.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000. This is a fair price considering the value you mentioned, and it's a good compromise for both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,4,
