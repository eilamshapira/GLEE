Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. Unfortunately, I can't accept $9,500 as that's below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value, and I actually have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $10,000 for it. However, I'd prefer to sell it to you if we can reach a fair agreement. Could you consider $10,500? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value for a product worth $12,000 to the right buyer."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
