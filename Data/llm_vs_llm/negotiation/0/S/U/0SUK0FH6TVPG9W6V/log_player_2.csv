Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. Unfortunately, I can't accept $9500 as that's below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value, and I actually have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $10000 for it. However, I'd prefer to sell it to you if we can reach a fair agreement. Could you consider $10500? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value for a product worth $12000 to the right buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
