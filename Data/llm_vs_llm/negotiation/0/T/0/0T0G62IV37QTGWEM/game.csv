"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs and budget. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I must inform you that I have another buyer willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which is my absolute minimum acceptable price. Given the product's exceptional value, I'm willing to revise my initial offer to $1800000, which I believe is still a competitive price considering its worth. Would you be interested in proceeding at this price?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for sharing the information about the other buyer. Considering this new information, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's closer to your minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, matching the other buyer's offer. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
