Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs and budget. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer because:
1. Bob's offer of $800,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000
2. I have John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 as a backup
3. Since Bob is still engaging in negotiation, there's potential to reach a higher price that would be better than John's offer"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I must inform you that I have another buyer willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is my absolute minimum acceptable price.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for sharing the information about the other buyer. Considering this new information, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's closer to your minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, matching the other buyer's offer. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

I'm choosing to sell to John because:
1. Bob is only offering the same price as John ($1,000,000)
2. Based on Bob's negotiation pattern, he seems unwilling to go significantly above $1,000,000
3. Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob losing interest
4. Since both offers are identical, there's no advantage in continuing negotiations with Bob
5. Taking John's guaranteed offer now provides certainty and closes the deal immediately"
