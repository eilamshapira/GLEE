"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Looking at the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $20,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $8,000

Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and John is offering it at exactly $8,000, Alice's offer of $20,000 is much higher than both my valuation and my alternative option. The rational choice is to buy from John.
