You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me. Alice is offering it for $1,500,000, which is too high. I would rather buy it from John for $1,200,000 than accept Alice's offer.
