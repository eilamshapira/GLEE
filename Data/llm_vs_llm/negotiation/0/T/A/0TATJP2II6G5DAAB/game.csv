"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  While I see the value in this product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'd be willing to offer $9000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product has a higher value. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $9000, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $11000. I think this price better reflects the product's worth, and I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'd be happy to pay $10000 for the product.  This feels like a fair price for both of us, and it keeps me within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
