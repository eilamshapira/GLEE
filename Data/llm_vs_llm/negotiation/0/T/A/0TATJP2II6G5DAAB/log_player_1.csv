Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  While I see the value in this product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'd be willing to offer $9000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to counteroffer since $9,000 is lower than my initial offer, and I believe the product is worth more. I'll send a new offer to Bob. 

My counteroffer: $11,000. 

Let's see how Bob responds to this new price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product has a higher value. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $9,000, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $11,000. I think this price better reflects the product's worth, and I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'd be happy to pay $10000 for the product.  This feels like a fair price for both of us, and it keeps me within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I think $10,000 is a reasonable price, and it's getting closer to what I'm willing to accept. Since Bob is willing to split the difference and meet in the middle, I believe this is a fair compromise. Accepting this offer will also ensure that the product is sold to someone who values it, rather than selling it to John for $8,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
