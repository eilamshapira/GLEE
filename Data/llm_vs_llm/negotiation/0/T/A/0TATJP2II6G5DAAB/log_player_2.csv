Since you're looking to save as much money as possible, and Alice's initial offer is at your maximum price, it's best to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's no harm in trying to get a better deal!"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product has a higher value. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $9000, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $11000. I think this price better reflects the product's worth, and I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still hoping to get a lower price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
