"Hello Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. It's a high-quality item with excellent features and durability. I'm offering it to you for $25000. This is a competitive price for the value this product will provide to you. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on this offer.",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $25000 is too high. The maximum value of the product is $15000. I am willing to buy the product for $10000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I need to clarify that my absolute minimum for this product is $15000, which represents the baseline value to me. While your offer of $10000 is too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down from my initial price. I can offer the product for $20000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. This product offers substantial value that justifies this price point. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $20000 is still too high. I can increase my offer to $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer to $11000, which shows your interest in the product. However, I must be transparent that I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at $15000. This is my absolute minimum acceptable price, as I mentioned earlier. Given our ongoing negotiation, I'm willing to meet you at $17500, which is a substantial discount from my previous offers and represents very good value. This is significantly lower than my initial price point while still allowing me some margin above my minimum. Can we make a deal at this price?",17500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see that we are still far apart on the price. I am willing to increase my offer to $12000. This is a significant increase from my previous offers.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increased offer of $12000. We're getting closer, but we're still not quite there. As I mentioned, I have John willing to pay $15000, which is my minimum acceptable price. However, I'd prefer to conclude our deal if possible. My final offer is $16000 - this is the absolute lowest I can go while still making this worth my while over simply selling to John. It's a strong discount from where we started and represents excellent value. Can we agree on this price?",16000.0,Alice,7,
