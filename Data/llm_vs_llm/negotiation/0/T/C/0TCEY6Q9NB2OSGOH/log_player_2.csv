Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I need to clarify that my absolute minimum for this product is $15000, which represents the baseline value to me. While your offer of $10000 is too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down from my initial price. I can offer the product for $20000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. This product offers substantial value that justifies this price point. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer to $11000, which shows your interest in the product. However, I must be transparent that I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at $15000. This is my absolute minimum acceptable price, as I mentioned earlier. Given our ongoing negotiation, I'm willing to meet you at $17500, which is a substantial discount from my previous offers and represents very good value. This is significantly lower than my initial price point while still allowing me some margin above my minimum. Can we make a deal at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increased offer of $12000. We're getting closer, but we're still not quite there. As I mentioned, I have John willing to pay $15000, which is my minimum acceptable price. However, I'd prefer to conclude our deal if possible. My final offer is $16000 - this is the absolute lowest I can go while still making this worth my while over simply selling to John. It's a strong discount from where we started and represents excellent value. Can we agree on this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
