"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $10000. It's a high-quality product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $10,000 is below my maximum budget of $15,000, I'm inclined to try and negotiate a better price. The product's value to me is worth no more than $15,000, but I don't know its value to Alice. Given that this is the first round and I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $10,000, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than her initial price. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. I'll offer $8,000, which is a reasonable starting point for the negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after considering your previous offer, I'm willing to lower my price. Would you be interested in purchasing the product for $9000? This price takes into account both our perspectives, and I believe it's a fair deal for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has lowered her price from $10,000 to $9,000, which is a positive sign that she's willing to negotiate. However, I still think I can get a better deal. Since my maximum budget is $15,000 and Alice's new offer is $9,000, I have some room to maneuver. I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer to see if I can get her to lower the price further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice lowered her price from $10,000 to $9,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her new offer and my previous counteroffer of $8,000. I'll offer $8,500, which is a slight increase from my previous offer, but still lower than Alice's current price of $9,000.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and lowering your price to $9,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"
