"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I also have a minimum price I can accept. Let's try $225. That's a significant reduction from my initial offer.",225.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your patience, Alice. $225 is still out of my reach. I can go up to $100 for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer, but we're still quite far apart. My bottom line is really $175. Could you consider that?",175.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $175 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer you $110 for the product. Would that work for you?",110.0,Bob,8,
