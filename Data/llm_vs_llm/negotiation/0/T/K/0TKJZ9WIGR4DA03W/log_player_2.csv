"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a incredible offer for you that I think you'll find very interesting. I'm willing to sell my premium product to you for $1200000. This product is highly valuable, and I'm confident that it will meet and exceed your expectations. If you accept the offer you will save at least $400000 from its true market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than your alternative option of buying from John for $1,500,000. While you don't know the product's true value to Alice, saving $300,000 makes accepting her offer a strong choice."
