"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $200 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could consider purchasing it for $80. Let me know if we can work something out.",80.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $80 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to lower my price to $180. Let me know if this works for you.",180.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 might still be a bit high for you. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer the product for $160. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for adjusting the price. I understand your position, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $90. Let me know if we can agree on this.",90.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $90 is still below my minimum price. I can go down to $150, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Let me know if this works for you.",150.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I need to stick to a price that reflects the value of the product. How about $140? This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",140.0,Alice,5,
