"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","The price Alice is offering ($200) is higher than the alternative option of buying from John for $120. Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and John's price matches that maximum value, it would be better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer.
