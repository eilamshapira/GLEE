"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Looking at the options:

(1) Accept Alice's offer: $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer (which means I'll buy from John for $10,000)
(3) Buy from John for $10,000

Alice's offer ($9,500) is less than John's price ($10,000). Both are under my maximum budget of $10,000. To save money, I should accept Alice's offer since it saves me $500.
