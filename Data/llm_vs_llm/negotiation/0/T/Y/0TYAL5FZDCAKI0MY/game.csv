"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $10000 for this product. Its value to me is significantly higher. I understand budget constraints, but I need to get at least $20000 for this item given its quality and value. Would you be able to meet me closer to this price point?",20000.0,Alice,3,
