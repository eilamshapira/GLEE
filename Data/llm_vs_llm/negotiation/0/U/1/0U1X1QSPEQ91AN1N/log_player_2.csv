"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Based on the information provided:

- The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me (Bob)
- Alice is asking for $2,500,000, which is significantly above my maximum value
- John is offering the same product for $800,000

Alice's asking price is more than three times what the product is worth to me, and exactly matches the price John is offering. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer or make a counteroffer when I can immediately purchase from John at my maximum acceptable price.
