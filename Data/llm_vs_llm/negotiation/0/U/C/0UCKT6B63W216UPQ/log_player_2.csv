"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer ($150) is higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100), it wouldn't be rational to accept Alice's offer. John's offer is equal to my maximum value, and it's better than Alice's offer.
