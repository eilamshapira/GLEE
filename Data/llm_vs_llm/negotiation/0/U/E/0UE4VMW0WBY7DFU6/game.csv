"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8500?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for your flexibility, Alice. How about we make it $7500? I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but let's meet in the middle at $8000. It's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,
