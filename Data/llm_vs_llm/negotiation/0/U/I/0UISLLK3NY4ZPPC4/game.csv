,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Is that something you'd be open to?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $200?",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new offer, so I'll offer $140 for the product. Is that something you'd consider?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal. However, I can't go that low and still make it worth my while. The lowest I can accept is $180. That's my final offer.",180.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your honesty about your final offer, but $180 is still above my budget. Considering you said $180 is your final offer, I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit to meet you closer to your price. I'll offer $145 for the product, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.",145.0,Bob,6,
