"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this exclusive product for $200. Let me know if you would like to purchase it at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","After examining Alice's offer of $200 for the product, I need to make a decision based on my best interest.

The product is worth no more than $80 to me, meaning I wouldn't want to pay more than that amount.

Alice is offering the product for $200, which is significantly above my maximum valuation.

John is willing to sell me the same product for $80, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me.

Given these considerations, the logical choice is to buy from John.
