"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a relatively high price to maximize my potential earnings. However, I'll also keep in mind that the price should be reasonable enough for Bob to consider making a counteroffer.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is lower than the minimum value of $10,000 that the product is worth to me, I will reject his offer. Additionally, selling to John for $10,000 is a better option than accepting Bob's offer, but I still want to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $8,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial offer of $20,000, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'll try to meet him halfway and see if we can find a mutually acceptable price.

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $9,000 is still lower than the price I'm aiming for, but it's getting closer. However, it's still lower than the $10,000 that John is willing to pay. Since I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, I'll reject Bob's offer again and try to get him to meet me at a higher price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $9,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous offer of $15,000, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'll try to find a middle ground and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.
