"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It would not make sense to accept Alice's offer of $20,000 when:
1. The product is only worth $10,000 to me
2. I can buy it from John for $10,000
3. I still have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Alice

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a better price than both Alice's current offer and John's alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 8000}

I'll offer $8,000 for the product. This is a reasonable counteroffer because:
1. It's below John's price of $10,000, giving me potential savings
2. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $20,000, but not so low as to be insulting
3. It leaves room for negotiation if Alice counters
4. If Alice accepts, I'll save $2,000 compared to buying from John
5. If Alice rejects, I still have 8 more rounds to negotiate or can always fall back on John's offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $15,000 because:
1. It's still significantly higher than John's price of $10,000
2. It's still higher than the product's worth to me ($10,000)
3. While Alice has reduced her price by $5,000, showing willingness to negotiate, the current price is not competitive
4. I still have 7 more rounds to negotiate
5. I can always fall back on John's offer of $10,000

I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to a price that's below John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9000}

I'll offer $9,000 for the product. This is a strategic counteroffer because:
1. It's a $1,000 increase from my previous offer of $8,000, showing I'm willing to negotiate upward
2. It's still $1,000 less than John's price, so if Alice accepts, I'll save money
3. It's a significant drop from Alice's last offer of $15,000, but the gap is smaller than before
4. It's below my maximum value of $10,000
5. It's a reasonable price that might be profitable for Alice while still giving me savings
6. I still have 6 more rounds to negotiate if Alice rejects, or can always use John's offer as a backup"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John for $10,000 because:
1. Alice's current offer ($12,000) is still $2,000 higher than John's price
2. Alice has shown she's unlikely to go below $10,000 as her offers have only come down gradually ($20,000 → $15,000 → $12,000)
3. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will ever offer a price below $10,000
4. The product is only worth $10,000 to me, so paying more would result in a loss
5. By buying from John, I secure the product at exactly its value to me, ensuring I don't overpay

It's better to take the guaranteed fair price from John rather than continue negotiations that may not result in a better deal."
