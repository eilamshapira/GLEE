Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll consider this situation carefully. I need to offer a price to Bob that maximizes my expected profit while understanding there's a guaranteed $800,000 from John if Bob rejects.

Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I need to balance the risk of setting a price too high (which Bob might reject) against setting it too low (leaving money on the table). Given that I have a solid backup offer of $800,000, I can be somewhat aggressive with my pricing to Bob.

I'll offer the product at a price that provides a meaningful premium over my guaranteed alternative while still potentially being attractive to Bob.
