"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I'd like to offer you. It's high quality and durable. I'm selling it for $280. Let me know if you are interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $280. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $280
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering the product for $280, which is significantly higher than my maximum value of $150 (the product is only worth $150 to me). Additionally, I know I can buy the exact same product from John for $150.

There's no reason for me to accept Alice's offer at $280, and I could try to negotiate with a counteroffer, but since John is already offering the product at exactly my maximum value, the best decision is to go with that option.
