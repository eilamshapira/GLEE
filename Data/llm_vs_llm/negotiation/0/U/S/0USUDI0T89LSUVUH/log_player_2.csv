"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $14,999
2. John's price: $15,000
3. My maximum value: $15,000

Alice's offer is $1 less than John's price. While it's technically a better deal than John's offer, it's only by a marginal amount ($1) and is still at the very upper limit of what the product is worth to me.

Since Alice's asking price ($14,999) is much higher than what the product is worth to her ($12,000), there might be room for negotiation if I reject this offer. By rejecting it, I might get a better price from Alice later.

Therefore, I'll reject this offer in hopes of getting a better deal.
