"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that you have a budget to consider, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for us to accept. However, I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Let's meet in the middle at $1150000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle is a good idea, but I was thinking we could meet closer to my initial offer. How about we do $1000000? I'm willing to stretch my budget to this point, but I'd prefer not to go any higher.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
