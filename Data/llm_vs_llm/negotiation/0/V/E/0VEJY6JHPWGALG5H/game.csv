"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic [product description - be specific, but don't reveal too much] that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking $200 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its quality and value. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I've seen similar products on the market for much less. I can offer $70 for it, which I believe is a fair price.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is unfortunately far too low for me. I understand you've seen similar products for less, but mine has unique features and quality that set it apart. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $175. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'm offering.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $175 is still much higher than what I can justify spending. While I understand your product may have unique features, I have a strict budget to consider. I can go up to $85, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. If this doesn't work for you, I understand, as I know I can find similar products elsewhere within my budget.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $85 is still far too low for me to consider. I am willing to come down a bit more to $140, but I believe this is the absolute lowest I can go. If this doesn't work for you, I am ready to explore other options.",140.0,Alice,5,
