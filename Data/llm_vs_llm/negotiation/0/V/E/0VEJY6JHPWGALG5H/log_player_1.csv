Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I've seen similar products on the market for much less. I can offer $70 for it, which I believe is a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is unfortunately far too low for me. I understand you've seen similar products for less, but mine has unique features and quality that set it apart. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $175. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 175}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $175 is still much higher than what I can justify spending. While I understand your product may have unique features, I have a strict budget to consider. I can go up to $85, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. If this doesn't work for you, I understand, as I know I can find similar products elsewhere within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85.
