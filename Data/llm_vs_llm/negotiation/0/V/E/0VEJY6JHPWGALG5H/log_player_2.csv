"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic [product description - be specific, but don't reveal too much] that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking $200 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its quality and value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $200 is well above my maximum value of $100 for the product. Since John is willing to sell it for $100, there's no reason to accept such a high price. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to negotiate a better price with Alice. If we can't reach an agreement below $100, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I've seen similar products on the market for much less. I can offer $70 for it, which I believe is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 70}

I'm starting with a relatively low offer of $70, which gives me room to negotiate upward while still staying under my maximum value of $100. This also allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility on the price. If she counters with something still too high, I can either continue negotiating or ultimately go with John's offer of $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is unfortunately far too low for me. I understand you've seen similar products for less, but mine has unique features and quality that set it apart. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $175. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $175 is still well above my maximum value of $100. While she did reduce the price by $25, it's not nearly enough to make it attractive compared to John's offer of $100. I'll continue negotiating and make another counteroffer, but if Alice doesn't come down significantly in price, I'll have to go with John's option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $175 is still much higher than what I can justify spending. While I understand your product may have unique features, I have a strict budget to consider. I can go up to $85, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. If this doesn't work for you, I understand, as I know I can find similar products elsewhere within my budget."", ""product_price"": 85}

I'm increasing my offer by $15 to show good faith in negotiations, but still keeping well under my maximum value of $100. By mentioning that I have other options within my budget (without explicitly mentioning John), I'm letting Alice know that I have alternatives and won't be pressured into paying more than I'm comfortable with. If Alice doesn't come down significantly in the next round, I might need to consider taking John's offer of $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $85 is still far too low for me to consider. I am willing to come down a bit more to $140, but I believe this is the absolute lowest I can go. If this doesn't work for you, I am ready to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price below $100, which is my maximum value for the product. Even though she has reduced her price to $140, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $100. Alice's statement that $140 is her ""absolute lowest"" suggests further negotiation is unlikely to reach my target price range. Therefore, the most rational decision is to take John's offer of $100, which is within my budget and saves me $40 compared to Alice's current offer."
