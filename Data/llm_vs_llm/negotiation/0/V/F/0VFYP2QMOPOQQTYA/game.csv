"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to consider that?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While $150 represents a fair price for this product, I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer of $60 and your new offer of $110, which would be $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's make this happen. What if we settled for $95? That's me coming down quite a bit, and I believe it's a very fair offer.",95.0,Alice,5,
