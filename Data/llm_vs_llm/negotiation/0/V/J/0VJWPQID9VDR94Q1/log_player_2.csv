"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this situation:

- The product is worth at most $1,500,000 to me
- Alice's offer is $1,400,000
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $1,500,000

Since Alice's offer ($1,400,000) is less than my maximum valuation ($1,500,000) and less than John's price ($1,500,000), I should accept Alice's offer to save $100,000.
