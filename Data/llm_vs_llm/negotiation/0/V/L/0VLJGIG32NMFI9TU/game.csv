"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is significantly above my budget. I know the product's value and I can actually get it from another seller for $1000000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $850000 for the product? This would be beneficial for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in doing business with me. However, $850000 is significantly lower than the product's value. I understand that you have other options, but I believe that the product's quality and the service I provide add significant value to the deal.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle and set the price at $1050000. This way, both of us can walk away from the deal satisfied.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I have a firm offer from another seller for $1000000. For me to choose you as my supplier, I would need a better price than that. I can offer you $950000, which would give you a quick sale while saving me some money. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both.",950000.0,Bob,4,
