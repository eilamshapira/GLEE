Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is significantly above my budget. I know the product's value and I can actually get it from another seller for $1000000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $850000 for the product? This would be beneficial for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm willing to meet you in the middle and set the price at $1,050,000. This way, both of us can walk away from the deal satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I have a firm offer from another seller for $1000000. For me to choose you as my supplier, I would need a better price than that. I can offer you $950000, which would give you a quick sale while saving me some money. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both.

I hope we can collaborate again in the future under different conditions."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
