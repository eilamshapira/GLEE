"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm delighted to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll agree that $1200000 is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer because $1,200,000 is above my maximum value of $1,000,000, and it's also higher than John's price. I can either try to negotiate with Alice for a better price or buy from John if negotiations don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I know the product's value and I can actually get it from another seller for $1,000,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $850,000 for the product? This would be beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in doing business with me. However, $850000 is significantly lower than the product's value. I understand that you have other options, but I believe that the product's quality and the service I provide add significant value to the deal.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle and set the price at $1050000. This way, both of us can walk away from the deal satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer because while Alice has come down significantly, it's still above John's price of $1,000,000. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, and I know I can get it for $1,000,000 from John, I should try one more time to negotiate with Alice for a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I have a firm offer from another seller for $1,000,000. For me to choose you as my supplier, I would need a better price than that. I can offer you $950,000, which would give you a quick sale while saving me some money. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
