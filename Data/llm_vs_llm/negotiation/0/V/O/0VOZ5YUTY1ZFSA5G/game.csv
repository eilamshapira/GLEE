"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a lower price point. How about $8000? I believe this price still reflects the product's value and fits my budget more comfortably.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking of a price that's slightly higher than $8000, considering the product's exceptional quality and potential long-term benefits. I'd like to propose a price of $10500, which I believe is more reflective of the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations and look forward to hearing your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I have a budget to maintain. How about we meet in the middle at $9250? This price seems more reasonable to me while still valuing the product's quality.",9250.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still slightly above your proposed price. I'd like to counter with a price of $10000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value and our previous discussions. I'm open to further negotiations and look forward to hearing your thoughts.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress towards a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your proposal of $9500, I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer of $10000 and your current offer. I propose a price of $9750, which I believe is a fair compromise.
