"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. Since I know the product is valued around $100, I'd like to offer $105 for it. This gives you a $5 profit while helping me save a bit more. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you're on a budget, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a competitive price and still saves you some money.",110.0,Alice,3,
