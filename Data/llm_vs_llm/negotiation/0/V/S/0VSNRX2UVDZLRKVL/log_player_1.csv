# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. Since I know the product is valued around $100, I'd like to offer $105 for it. This gives you a $5 profit while helping me save a bit more. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
