"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given the situation, Alice is offering the product for $115, while I know I can buy the same product from John for $120. The product is worth $100 to Alice.

I should reject Alice's offer because:
1. I can potentially negotiate a better price with Alice
2. $115 is already $5 cheaper than John's price, so I have room to negotiate
3. The product is worth $100 to Alice, so she has room to lower the price

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. Since I know the product is valued around $100, I'd like to offer $105 for it. This gives you a $5 profit while helping me save a bit more. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you're on a budget, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a competitive price and still saves you some money. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has countered with $110, which is a fair compromise between my offer of $105 and her initial offer of $115. This price is:

1. $10 cheaper than John's price of $120
2. $10 above Alice's cost of $100, giving her a reasonable profit
3. A good value for me since it's below my maximum threshold of $120

Since Alice has already come down $5 from her initial offer and we're now at a price that represents a fair middle ground, I'll accept this offer.
