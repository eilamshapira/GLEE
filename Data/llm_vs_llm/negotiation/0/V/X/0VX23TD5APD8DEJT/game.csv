"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1000000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $800000,  but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $950000 is still a little too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $875000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",875000.0,Bob,4,
