You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me (Bob). Alice is offering it for $25,000. If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy it from John for $15,000. Since $25,000 is greater than $15,000, I should reject Alice's offer. Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000.
