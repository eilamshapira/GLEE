"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Let's see if Alice can lower her price. The product is worth only $10,000 to me, so I should try to negotiate down from Alice's initial offer of $15,000.)

Counteroffer: $8,000"

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 8000}"
