Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as his offer of $1,000,000 is lower than I'm willing to accept, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll send him a new offer. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you think the initial price was steep, but I believe the product's value is higher. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. My counteroffer is $2,500,000.""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think the price is higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer.

Since Bob's counteroffer of $1,500,000 matches the minimum price I'm willing to accept and also matches the price John is willing to pay, I don't see a need to continue negotiating or risking losing both deals. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get the price I'm willing to sell for."
