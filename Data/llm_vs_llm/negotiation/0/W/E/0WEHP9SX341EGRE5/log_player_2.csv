"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer of $120 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80), it makes sense to reject this offer. I can either make a counteroffer to Alice in the next round or ultimately choose to buy from John if Alice doesn't lower her price enough."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 65}

I'm offering $65, which is below John's price of $80. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to John's price. If Alice rejects this offer, we can continue negotiating, and I still have the option to buy from John at $80 if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $95 because it's still higher than John's price of $80. There's no reason to accept a price higher than $80 when I can get the same product from John at $80. I'll make another counteroffer to see if Alice will come down to a more competitive price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

I'm offering $70, which is a slight increase from my previous offer of $65 to show willingness to negotiate, but still significantly below John's price of $80. This gives Alice room to make a profit while potentially giving me a better deal than John's price. If Alice rejects this offer, I can still buy from John at $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer ($85) is still above John's price ($80), and Alice seems reluctant to go below $80 after several rounds of negotiation, the best decision is to buy from John at $80. There's no reason to pay more than $80 when we have a guaranteed option at that price."
