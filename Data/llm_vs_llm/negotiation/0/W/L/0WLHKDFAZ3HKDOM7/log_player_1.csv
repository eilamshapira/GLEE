Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase my product for $1,450,000. This is a unique product that offers significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **High but Reasonable:** $1,450,000 is a high price, reflecting the product's value to us. However, it's still a significant discount from our minimum and allows Bob a perceived ""good deal."" 
* **Exclusivity:**  Framing the offer as ""exclusive"" adds a layer of appeal and might make Bob more inclined to accept before losing the opportunity.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes we don't have time constraints.  If a quick sale is essential, a price closer to John's offer might be necessary.
* Bob's negotiation skills are unknown. We've left room for potential counter-offers while still staying above our minimum."
