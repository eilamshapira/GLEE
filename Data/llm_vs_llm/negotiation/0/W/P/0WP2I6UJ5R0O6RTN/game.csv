"Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on its features and market value, I'm pricing it at $25000. This product offers excellent value and is in perfect condition. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I find the price to be much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm looking to spend no more than $4000 on this product. Would you be open to negotiating the price down to this amount?",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a more affordable price, but I need to emphasize that this product is highly valuable and $4000 is significantly below its market value. My minimum acceptable price is $15000, which is actually the same price another buyer, John, is already willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Could you reconsider your offer and meet me at $20000? This would still represent a substantial discount from my initial price.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $20000 is still far from what I'm looking to spend. I can increase my offer to $5000 to show good faith, but that's the highest I can go. If this doesn't work for you, I understand and may need to explore other options.",5000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $5000 is still significantly below the product's value. Given that I have John ready to purchase at $15000, I can't accept anything lower than that amount. However, since I'd prefer to work with you, I can come down to $17500, which is my final offer. This is already a substantial discount from my initial price and just slightly above what I could get immediately from another buyer. Please let me know if this works for you.",17500.0,Alice,5,
