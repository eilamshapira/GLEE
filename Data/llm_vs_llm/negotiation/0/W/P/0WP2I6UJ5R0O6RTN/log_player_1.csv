Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I find the price to be much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm looking to spend no more than $4000 on this product. Would you be open to negotiating the price down to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a more affordable price, but I need to emphasize that this product is highly valuable and $4,000 is significantly below its market value. My minimum acceptable price is $15,000, which is actually the same price another buyer, John, is already willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible.
