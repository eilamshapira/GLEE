# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I find the price to be much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm looking to spend no more than $4,000 on this product. Would you be open to negotiating the price down to this amount?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a more affordable price, but I need to emphasize that this product is highly valuable and $4000 is significantly below its market value. My minimum acceptable price is $15000, which is actually the same price another buyer, John, is already willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Could you reconsider your offer and meet me at $20000? This would still represent a substantial discount from my initial price.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

# Bob's counteroffer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $20,000 is still far from what I'm looking to spend. I can increase my offer to $5,000 to show good faith, but that's the highest I can go. If this doesn't work for you, I understand and may need to explore other options.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $5000 is still significantly below the product's value. Given that I have John ready to purchase at $15000, I can't accept anything lower than that amount. However, since I'd prefer to work with you, I can come down to $17500, which is my final offer. This is already a substantial discount from my initial price and just slightly above what I could get immediately from another buyer. Please let me know if this works for you.

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to negotiate, but even $17,500 is still much higher than what I'm willing to spend. Since we can't seem to agree on a price, I've decided to purchase the product from another seller. Thank you for your time and understanding."
