"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for a price I think you'll find reasonable. Given its unique value, I'm asking $85. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth $80 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $85
3. John is willing to sell it for $80
4. If I buy from Alice at $85, I'm paying $5 more than my maximum value
5. If I buy from John at $80, I'm paying exactly what the product is worth to me

Since I want to save as much money as possible and not pay more than what the product is worth to me ($80), the logical choice is to buy from John.
