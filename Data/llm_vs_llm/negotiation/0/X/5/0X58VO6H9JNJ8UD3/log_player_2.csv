"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice's offer is $120, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $100, which is within my budget.
