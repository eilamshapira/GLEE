"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'd like to offer you a special opportunity to purchase a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. This product is currently available for $14000, which represents exceptional value considering its features and benefits. I have another interested buyer, John, who is prepared to purchase it at $12000, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity. Would you be interested in acquiring this product at $14000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $14,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. Additionally, I know that I can buy the product from John for $12,000, which is within my budget.
