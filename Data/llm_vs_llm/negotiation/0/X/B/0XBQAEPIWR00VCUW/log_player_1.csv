Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm confident it will be a valuable addition to your collection. I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 2,500,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $2500000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $500000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate and try to reach a better price. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed option, but I want to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob. 

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is below the product's value. I'm willing to consider a serious offer and make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $2,200,000."", ""product_price"": 2,200,000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have a certain value in mind, but $2200000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $600000. I'm serious about buying, but only at a reasonable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $600,000 is still significantly lower than the product's value to me. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer. I want to continue negotiating with Bob to try to reach a better price. Since I have 6 rounds left, I can afford to keep exploring the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $600,000 is still below the product's value. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $2,000,000. This is a serious offer, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 2,000,000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to meet you in the middle, but $2000000 is still beyond what I can justify. My maximum budget for this product is $1200000. I can offer you $750000. If we can't get closer to my budget soon, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still lower than the product's value to me, and I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer. However, I take note that Bob mentioned his maximum budget is $1,200,000, which is closer to a price I might be willing to accept. I'll try to make a counteroffer that is closer to his budget but still reflects the product's value.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to make a more significant compromise to meet you closer to your budget. I can offer the product to you for $1,800,000. This is a serious offer, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1,800,000}"
