"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000. This still leaves room for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's try to find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a deal. Let's close this now.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to drop to $10500, which is closer to your offer but still allows me to make a profit.  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
