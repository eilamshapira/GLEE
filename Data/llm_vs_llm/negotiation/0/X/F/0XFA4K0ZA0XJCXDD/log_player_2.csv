{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000. This still leaves room for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's try to find a middle ground.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a deal. Let's close this now."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to drop to $10500, which is closer to your offer but still allows me to make a profit.  I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

It's getting close to my limit, but $10,500 is a good deal, especially since Alice is coming down."
