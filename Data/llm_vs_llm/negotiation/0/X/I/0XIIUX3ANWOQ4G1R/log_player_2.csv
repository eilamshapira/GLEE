"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $1,200,000 is higher than my maximum value ($1,000,000) and higher than John's price ($1,000,000). It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations with Alice don't lead to a better price, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

I'll make a counteroffer of $800,000, which is significantly below John's price of $1,000,000. This gives room for negotiation while potentially saving money compared to John's offer. If Alice accepts, I'll save $200,000 compared to buying from John. If she counters with a higher price, we can still negotiate towards a mutually acceptable price below $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,100,000 is still higher than John's price of $1,000,000, so there's no reason to accept it. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round. I still have several rounds left to negotiate a better price with Alice, and I can always fall back on John's $1,000,000 offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 850000}

I'll increase my previous offer to $850,000. This shows some flexibility and movement in the negotiation while still keeping the price well below John's $1,000,000. This would save $150,000 compared to John's price if Alice accepts. I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by increasing my offer, but still maintaining a good margin for potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $1,000,000. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($1,050,000) is still above John's price ($1,000,000)
2. While we could continue negotiating, Alice's price reductions have been relatively small (from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000 to $1,050,000)
3. Given this pattern, it seems unlikely that Alice will go below John's price
4. While we have more rounds available, there's no guarantee of getting a better deal than John's offer

Therefore, it's most rational to take John's guaranteed price of $1,000,000 rather than risk further negotiations that may not yield a better result."
