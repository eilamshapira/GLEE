Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a reasonably high offer to leave room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and it's a reasonable counter to my initial offer, I'll accept it. There's no guarantee that further negotiation would yield a better result, and I risk Bob walking away if I push too hard.
