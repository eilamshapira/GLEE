"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this item and I think you might be interested. I'm asking for $230 for it. What do you think?",230.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $230 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $40 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering my budget.",40.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your budget constraints, but $40 is too low for me.  This item is worth a lot more due to its quality and condition. How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you consider $180?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $180 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $50. I think it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",50.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but your offers are simply too low for me to consider. I'm confident this item has a good value and I need to get a fair price for it.  I'm willing to let it go for $150, my absolute lowest price. This is a great deal for you.  What do you say?",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a fair price for the product, but $150 is still too high for me. Considering your previous statement that $150 is your absolute lowest price, I'm willing to make a more significant increase in my offer. I'll meet you closer to the middle with $70. I think this is a reasonable compromise.",70.0,Bob,6,
