Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $230 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $40 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering my budget.

Round 3

This item is worth a lot more due to its quality and condition. How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you consider $180?"", ""product_price"": 180}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but your offers are simply too low for me to consider.

What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a fair price for the product, but $150 is still too high for me. Considering your previous statement that $150 is your absolute lowest price, I'm willing to make a more significant increase in my offer. I'll meet you closer to the middle with $70. I think this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

It's clear Bob is not willing to budge much higher. It's not worth wasting further time when I have a guaranteed offer for $150 from John."
