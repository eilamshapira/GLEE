"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I need to make an initial offer to Bob that maximizes my potential profit while leaving room for negotiation if needed. Since I know the product is worth at least $80 to me, and I have John's guaranteed offer of $80 as a fallback, I'll start with a higher price.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob is offering $70, which is less than my minimum acceptable value of $80 (and less than John's guaranteed offer), I should reject this offer. John is offering $80, but I'll try one more counteroffer to Bob before considering selling to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer somewhat to show flexibility while still aiming for a price higher than my minimum threshold of $80.

{""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob is now offering $85, which is above my minimum threshold of $80 and higher than John's guaranteed offer of $80. Since this offer meets my requirements and is better than my alternative option, I should accept.
