"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I know the product is worth $100 to Bob and $150 to me, I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum acceptable price.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","I'll reject Bob's offer of $70 as it's well below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Since I can guarantee $150 from John, and Bob's initial offer is very low (suggesting he might not be willing to reach my minimum price), I'll sell to John.
