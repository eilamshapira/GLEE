Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $15,000 to Bob
2. My minimum acceptable price is $8,000
3. If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $8,000 from John
4. Bob knows his maximum value ($15,000) but doesn't know my minimum ($8,000)
5. Bob will accept any price up to $15,000 if he's acting rationally

I should offer a price that's high enough to maximize my profit but not so high that Bob will reject it. Since Bob values it at $15,000, I'll offer it at $13,500, which gives him enough incentive to accept while maximizing my profit.
