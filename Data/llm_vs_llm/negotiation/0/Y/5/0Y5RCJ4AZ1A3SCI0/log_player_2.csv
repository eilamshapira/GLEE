"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $13,500 is less than my maximum budget of $15,000, and it's also closer to the value I'm willing to pay, I will choose to accept Alice's offer.
