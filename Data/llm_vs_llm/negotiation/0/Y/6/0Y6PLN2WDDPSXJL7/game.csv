"Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, though I understand its worth is subjective.  To find a fair starting point, I propose a price of $2000000.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is above my budget for this product. I believe a more reasonable price would be $900000, considering the value it holds for me. I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1650000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your attempt to meet in the middle, but $1650000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $1050000, which I believe is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm open to further negotiations.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While I value your offer, the product's worth to the right buyer is significantly higher.  Would you consider $1425000?  This reflects a significant reduction on my part while acknowledging the product's true value.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the reduction in your offer, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, $1425000 is still above my target price. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $1150000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle soon.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This is a significant concession and reflects my desire to close this deal.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your concession and willingness to come down to $1300000. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $1200000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If we can meet at this price, I'm ready to close the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
