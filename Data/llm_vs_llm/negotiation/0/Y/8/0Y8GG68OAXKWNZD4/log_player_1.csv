Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer will help me understand how interested Bob is and what he might consider a reasonable price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I know I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me leverage to aim higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Depending on Bob's response, I might be willing to negotiate the price."
