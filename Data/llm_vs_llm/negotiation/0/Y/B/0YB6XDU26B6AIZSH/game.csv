"Hello Bob, I'm excited you're interested in my product. It's truly a one-of-a-kind item. I'm offering it to you for $18000. Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While $10000 is lower than I'm comfortable with, I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $16000. This is the lowest I am willing to go.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12000, which is the highest I can go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,
