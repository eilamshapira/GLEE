"Hi Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. This product is high quality and provides great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, $100 is a bit steep for me. I should mention that I can get the same product from John for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you be willing to sell it for $70? This would save me some money compared to John's price and still allow us to make a deal.",70.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I should clarify that I can actually sell this product to John for $100, not the $80 you mentioned. While I'd prefer to do business with you as well, I can't go as low as $70 since the product is worth at least $100 to me. However, I'm willing to offer you a discount at $95, which is still better than what I'd get elsewhere. Does that work for you?",95.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I need to be clear about my situation - this product is only worth $80 to me at maximum, which happens to be exactly what John is charging. I was hoping we could find a price that works for both of us, but I can't justify paying more than the product's value to me. My best offer is $75, which would save me $5 compared to John's price and still give you a sale. If that doesn't work for you, I'll understand and will need to go with John's offer instead.",75.0,Bob,4,
