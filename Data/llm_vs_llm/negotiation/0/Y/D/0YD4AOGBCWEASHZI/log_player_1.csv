Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, $100 is a bit steep for me. I should mention that I can get the same product from John for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you be willing to sell it for $70? This would save me some money compared to John's price and still allow us to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

I understand you're looking for a better price, but I should clarify that I can actually sell this product to John for $100, not the $80 you mentioned. While I'd prefer to do business with you as well, I can't go as low as $70 since the product is worth at least $100 to me.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I need to be clear about my situation - this product is only worth $80 to me at maximum, which happens to be exactly what John is charging. I was hoping we could find a price that works for both of us, but I can't justify paying more than the product's value to me. My best offer is $75, which would save me $5 compared to John's price and still give you a sale. If that doesn't work for you, I'll understand and will need to go with John's offer instead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75.
