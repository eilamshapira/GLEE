"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","The offer from Alice is $20,000, which is higher than the $10,000 the product is worth to me. It's also higher than John's offer of $10,000. Since I can get the same product from John for $10,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer of $20,000.

I could reject and make a counteroffer, but since I already have a guaranteed option to buy at $10,000 from John, and the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, the logical choice is to buy from John.
