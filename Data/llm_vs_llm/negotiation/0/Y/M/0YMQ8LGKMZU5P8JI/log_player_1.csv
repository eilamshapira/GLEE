Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product. I'm asking **$15,000** for it.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm ready to make you an offer on this product. I think you'll find it's a great deal. I'm asking $15,000."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but $15000 is actually the price that another seller, John, is offering me for the same product. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I'd need a better price. I'm thinking $10000 would be fair. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Considering Bob's offer of $10,000 and my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, I have to make a decision that maximizes my profit. Selling to Bob at $10,000 is better than selling to John at $8,000.
