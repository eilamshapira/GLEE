"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm ready to make you an offer on this product. I think you'll find it's a great deal. I'm asking $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she's asking for $15,000, which is exactly the same price that John is willing to sell the product for. This is also the maximum amount the product is worth to me.

Since Alice's price doesn't provide any savings compared to John's offer, and since I want to try to save money if possible, I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I'd need a better price. I'm thinking $10,000 would be fair. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
