"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she's asking for $1,000,000, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay for the product. This happens to be exactly the same price that John is offering as my outside option.

Since Alice's initial offer is at my maximum valuation, it makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer that could potentially save me money. There's no downside to negotiating further since I can always fall back on John's $1,000,000 offer if negotiations with Alice don't work out.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, which gives room for negotiation while potentially saving me money.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has now offered the product for $750,000, which is $250,000 less than both her initial offer and John's price. This is a significant improvement and represents a substantial savings. However, since we're still negotiating and Alice has already reduced her price significantly, there might be room for an even better deal.

Given that I can always fall back on John's offer or accept Alice's current offer later if needed, it makes sense to continue negotiating to try to save even more money.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down significantly from $1,000,000 to $750,000, I'll increase my previous offer but still aim for additional savings. I'll split the difference between my previous offer ($500,000) and her current offer ($750,000).

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has now offered the product for $700,000, which is a $50,000 reduction from her previous offer of $750,000. She's continuing to lower her price, though at a slower rate. At $700,000, I would be saving $300,000 compared to John's price.

While I could continue negotiating, Alice's decreasing concessions suggest we may be approaching her limit. The current offer already represents a substantial 30% discount from my maximum valuation, and continuing to negotiate risks Alice becoming frustrated.

Given the significant savings already achieved and the diminishing returns from further negotiation, I'll accept this offer.
