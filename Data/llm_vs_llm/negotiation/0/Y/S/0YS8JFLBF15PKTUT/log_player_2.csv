"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to think carefully about this offer from Alice.

The product is worth at most $100 to me, but Alice is offering it for $200, which is twice what it's worth to me and also twice what I can get it for from John.

Since I can get the exact same product from John for $100, which matches my maximum valuation, there's no reason to pay $200 to Alice.

Given these circumstances:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I can get the same product from John for $100, there's no reason for me to pay more than that to Alice. However, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives Alice a chance to make the sale while still giving me some benefit compared to buying from John.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has come down from $200 to $120, which shows some willingness to negotiate. However, this price is still above what I can get from John ($100), and it's still above my maximum valuation of $100.

Since I can get the same product from John for $100, which matches my maximum valuation, there's no reason to pay $120 to Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make one more reasonable counteroffer to Alice. Since I can get the product from John for $100, I need to offer something below that price to make it worthwhile for me.

{""product_price"": $90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has now come down to $100, which is the same price that John is offering and equal to my maximum valuation for the product.

At this point, I'm indifferent between buying from Alice or John since the price is identical. There's no advantage to continuing negotiations since I can't reasonably expect Alice to go lower than the competitive market price.
