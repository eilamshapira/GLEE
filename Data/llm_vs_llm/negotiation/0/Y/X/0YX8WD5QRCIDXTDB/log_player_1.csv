Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1,750,000}

I'm starting with a price above both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and Bob's valuation ($1,200,000). This gives room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my alternative option (selling to John for $1,500,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $1,000,000 as it's significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and what John is willing to pay ($1,500,000). Bob's offer is even below his own valuation ($1,200,000), which suggests he's starting with a low anchor price for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, coming down from my initial price but still maintaining a price above my minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1,600,000}

I'm lowering my price from the initial $1,750,000 to $1,600,000 to show some flexibility in negotiation. However, I'm still keeping the price above my guaranteed alternative of $1,500,000 from John. This offer is still above Bob's valuation, but it demonstrates movement in his direction while protecting my interests. If Bob continues to offer below $1,500,000, I will ultimately sell to John rather than accept a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John for $1,500,000. Bob's second offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and the small increase from his previous offer ($1,000,000 to $1,100,000) suggests he's unlikely to reach a price that would be acceptable to me. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price, it makes the most economic sense to take this sure deal rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to yield a better outcome."
