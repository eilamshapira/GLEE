Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll carefully consider the situation:

1) I know my minimum acceptable price is $100 (my reservation value)
2) I don't know how much Bob values the product
3) If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed $100 from John
4) I want to maximize my earnings

Since I have a guaranteed $100 fallback, I should set a price higher than that to potentially earn more. However, setting it too high risks Bob rejecting it. Without knowing Bob's valuation, I'll choose a moderately higher price that gives me good upside while not being excessively high.
