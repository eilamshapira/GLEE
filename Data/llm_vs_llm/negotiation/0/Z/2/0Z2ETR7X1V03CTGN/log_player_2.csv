"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a great value for the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Reasoning: Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than John's fixed price of $15,000, and also higher than my maximum valuation of $15,000. Since I know I can get the product from John for $15,000, and Alice's initial offer is well above this price, it makes the most economic sense to buy from John rather than continue negotiations with Alice. There's no reason to accept a price that's $5,000 higher than an available alternative, nor is there much point in making a counteroffer when a guaranteed fair price is already available."
