Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but 1500000 is above my budget. I'd like to propose a lower price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, 1300000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a price of 700000, which I believe is a fair reflection of the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:

{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. We're making progress. However, $700,000 is still too low for us. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This price takes into account your budget and our valuation."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I believe we're close to finding a suitable price point. After reevaluating, we're willing to offer the product at $1,100,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually acceptable price. However, 1100000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'd like to propose a price of 750000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"":""SellToJhon""}

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a suitable price. However, given the current gap in our valuations, I've decided to accept another offer for the product. Thank you for your time and interest.""}

I chose to sell the product to John because Bob's offer of $750,000 is still significantly lower than the product's value to me and John's offer of $1,200,000. With only 4 rounds left and Bob's offers not showing significant increases, it's likely that continuing negotiations with Bob won't yield a price higher than John's offer. Therefore, the best course of action is to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
