"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Looking at the options:

1. Alice is offering the product for $200, which is more than what it's worth to me ($100).
2. I could reject and make a counteroffer.
3. I can buy from John for $100, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me.

Since Alice is starting with an offer that's higher than both the product's value to me and John's guaranteed price, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has lowered her price from $200 to $180, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $180 is still above the product's worth to me ($100) and above John's price ($100).

Since I can get the same product from John for $100, which is exactly the maximum I'm willing to pay, Alice's offer of $180 is not attractive.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has reduced her price to $160, which shows further willingness to negotiate, but this is still above both:
- The maximum value of the product to me ($100)
- John's guaranteed price ($100)

There's no reason for me to accept this price when I can get the same product at a lower price.
