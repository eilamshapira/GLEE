Hello Bob! I have a premium product I'd like to offer you today. This is a high-quality item that I'm currently selling for $120. I believe this is a fair price for the value you'll receive. Are you interested in purchasing at this price?,120.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While the product sounds interesting, $120 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $90 is closer to what I can accept, I still need to get a bit more for this product given its quality and value. I can come down to $110, which I think is a fair compromise. How does that sound?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks Alice, $110 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $100. That's the most I can realistically spend right now.",100.0,Bob,4,
