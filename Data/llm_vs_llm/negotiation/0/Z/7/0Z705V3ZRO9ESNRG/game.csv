,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice, but I think $18000 is too high. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. How about we proceed with this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, this product is worth significantly more than $10000 to me.  I could sell it to another buyer right now for considerably more. To make this work for both of us, I can come down to $16000.  This is my best offer.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16000 is still higher than what I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11000. Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, but $11000 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $15500. This is a firm offer, and very close to what I could get elsewhere. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.",15500.0,Alice,5,
