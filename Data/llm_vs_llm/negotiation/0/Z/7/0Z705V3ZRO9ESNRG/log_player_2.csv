Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. However, this product is worth significantly more than $10000 to me.  I could sell it to another buyer right now for considerably more. To make this work for both of us, I can come down to $16000.  This is my best offer.

Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still higher than what I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,000. Let's meet in the middle."

Alice, I appreciate your efforts to negotiate, but I think the price is still too high for me. I've decided to purchase the product from another seller. Thank you for your time and understanding."
