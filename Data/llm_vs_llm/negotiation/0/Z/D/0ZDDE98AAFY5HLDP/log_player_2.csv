"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since the product is worth $120 to me and Alice is offering it for $120, it's the same value to me. However, I have the opportunity to negotiate and potentially get a better price. Buying from John immediately doesn't give me that opportunity. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has come down from $120 to $110. This shows she is willing to negotiate. Since I value the product at $120, $110 is a good price, but I still want to try and save more money. I will reject her offer and make another counteroffer slightly higher than my initial offer but still lower than $110.
