"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $2,000,000, reject it, or buy from John for $800,000.

Given that:
- The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
- John is offering the product for $800,000
- Alice is offering the product for $2,000,000

Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is far above my maximum valuation of $800,000, and it's also much higher than John's offer. It makes no financial sense to accept Alice's offer.

The logical choice is to buy from John at $800,000, as this matches my maximum valuation while saving me $1,200,000 compared to Alice's offer.
