Send your offer to Bob.,"I will offer Bob a price of $115. This price is strategically chosen because:
1. It's below Bob's maximum value ($120), making it attractive for him to accept
2. It's well above my minimum acceptable price ($100)
3. If Bob accepts, I make $15 more than selling to John
4. Even if Bob rejects, I still have John's guaranteed $100 offer
