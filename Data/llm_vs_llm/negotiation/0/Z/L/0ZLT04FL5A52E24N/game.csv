"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $175 is too high for me. I can get the same product from John for $150. But I'd like to negotiate with you first. Would you consider selling it for $130? This would save me some money and still give you a fair price.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming back to me with a counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $130 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about we meet in the middle at $155? This still gives you a good deal while ensuring I can make a fair profit.",155.0,Alice,3,
