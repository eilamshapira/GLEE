"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $175 is too high for me. I can get the same product from John for $150. But I'd like to negotiate with you first. Would you consider selling it for $130? This would save me some money and still give you a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about we meet in the middle at $155? This still gives you a good deal while ensuring I can make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 155}
