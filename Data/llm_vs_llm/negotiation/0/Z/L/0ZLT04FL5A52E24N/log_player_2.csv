Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming back to me with a counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $130 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about we meet in the middle at $155? This still gives you a good deal while ensuring I can make a fair profit.
