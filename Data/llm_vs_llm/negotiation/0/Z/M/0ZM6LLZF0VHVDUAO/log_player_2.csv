"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

The product is worth $8,000 to Alice and $15,000 to me.  Rejecting Alice's offer of $12,000 gives me the opportunity to negotiate a lower price, potentially getting a better deal.  While buying from John for $15,000 is always an option, it's less desirable than trying to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500 for the product. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and still leaves room for negotiation. My goal is to find a price that is mutually beneficial and allows me to acquire the product for less than $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer of $10,500 is within my budget and a reasonable compromise. It's better than my previous counteroffer of $9,500 and still significantly lower than buying from John for $15,000."
