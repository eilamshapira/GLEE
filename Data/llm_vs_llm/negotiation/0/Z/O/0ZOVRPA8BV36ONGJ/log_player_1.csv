Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2,500,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's quite a bit higher than I was expecting. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $800000 for the product. Let's start the negotiation from there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and also lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better price. My next offer will be lower than my initial price but still higher than Bob's offer, in an attempt to find a mutually agreeable price.

Here's my counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $2,000,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I believe the product's value is worth more than your initial offer."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
