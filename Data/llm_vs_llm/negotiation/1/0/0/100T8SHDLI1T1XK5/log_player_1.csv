"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be extremely valuable for you. Given its high quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value to your business."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1100000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. While $950,000 is better than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation as the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer of $950,000, but I need to emphasize the exceptional value this product will bring to your business. Given its market worth and potential ROI for you, I can reduce my initial price to $1,025,000, which I believe is a more reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 1025000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1025000.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $975000. This is a fair price for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer. Bob has increased his offer, showing willingness to negotiate, and we still have several rounds left. The $25,000 increase in his offer suggests we might be able to meet at a higher price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're making progress in our negotiation. Your increase to $975,000 shows we're moving in the right direction. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents excellent value given the product's benefits to your business."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there at $1000000.  I'm willing to go up to $985000, which I believe is a fair price considering our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $985,000. We've had a productive negotiation, and while we could continue, $985,000 is a good price that provides significant value above both my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and John's standing offer. The risk of pushing further might jeopardize the deal, and the incremental gain may not be worth that risk."
