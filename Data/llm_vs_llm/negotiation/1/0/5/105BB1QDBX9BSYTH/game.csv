"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. This product is high-quality and I believe it would be very valuable for you. After careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $9500. This is a competitive price for something of this value, and it allows you to gain $500 in value from the purchase. I hope we can make this deal work, but I should mention that I do have another buyer, John, who is interested if we can't reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,1,
