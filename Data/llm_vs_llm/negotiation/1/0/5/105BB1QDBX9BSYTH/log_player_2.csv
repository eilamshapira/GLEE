"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. This product is high-quality and I believe it would be very valuable for you. After careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $9500. This is a competitive price for something of this value, and it allows you to gain $500 in value from the purchase. I hope we can make this deal work, but I should mention that I do have another buyer, John, who is interested if we can't reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum price point of $10,000.  It's better to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a better price with Alice or simply buy from John for your maximum price."
