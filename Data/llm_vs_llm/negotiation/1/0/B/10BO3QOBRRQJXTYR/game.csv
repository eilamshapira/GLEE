"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While $13500 is below market price, I've done some research on similar products and believe a fair price would be closer to $11200. This still provides you with a good profit margin while giving me some value as well. I'm prepared to purchase immediately at this price.",11200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $11200 is too low considering the product's value. I can come down from my initial price to $12500, which I believe is a fair compromise that would benefit both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for working with me on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $11850? This gives you a healthy profit above your cost while still being substantially below market price. I'm ready to complete the purchase immediately at this price.",11850.0,Bob,4,
