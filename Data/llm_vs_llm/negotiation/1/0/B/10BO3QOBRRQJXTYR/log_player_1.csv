Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $13,500. This represents a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While $13500 is below market price, I've done some research on similar products and believe a fair price would be closer to $11200. This still provides you with a good profit margin while giving me some value as well. I'm prepared to purchase immediately at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. While $11,200 is above my minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation given that the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. I'll propose a price that's more balanced between our positions.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $11,200 is too low considering the product's value. I can come down from my initial price to $12,500, which I believe is a fair compromise that would benefit both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for working with me on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $11850? This gives you a healthy profit above your cost while still being substantially below market price. I'm ready to complete the purchase immediately at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,850
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $11,850. This is a reasonable compromise that gives me a good profit margin ($1,850 above my minimum price), and it's significantly better than John's standing offer of $10,000. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether, and Bob's offer represents a fair middle ground between our positions."
