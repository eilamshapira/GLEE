Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Considering the situation:

*   **My minimum value:** $1,500,000
*   **Bob's offer:** $750,000
*   **John's offer:** $1,500,000

I must reject Bob's offer. Selling to John is the better choice here, since I can't accept Bob's offer.
