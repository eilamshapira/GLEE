"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to consider my options carefully here.

Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000. The product is worth up to $1,200,000 to me, so Alice's offer is below my maximum valuation.

If I reject Alice's offer, my alternative is to buy from John for $1,200,000. This would cost me $200,000 more than Alice's price.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, I should accept Alice's offer of $1,000,000.
