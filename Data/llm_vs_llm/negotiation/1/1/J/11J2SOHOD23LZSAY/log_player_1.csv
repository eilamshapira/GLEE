Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its worth."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a middle ground that is more favorable to me. 

My counteroffer: $10,000 

Let's see how Bob responds to this new offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth more than $7,500 to you. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10000 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $8500. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob's final offer of $8,500 is higher than the alternative of selling to John for $8,000, and higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $8,500."
