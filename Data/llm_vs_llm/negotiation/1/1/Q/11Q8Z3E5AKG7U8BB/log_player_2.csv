"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offer is $140
2. I know the product is worth $120 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation
3. I can always buy from John at $150 as a fallback
4. $140 is less than John's price, but I might be able to get an even better deal from Alice

Given that Alice's cost is $120, there's potential to negotiate a lower price. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. Even if negotiations don't work out, I can still fall back to John's offer of $150.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's above Alice's cost ($120) but significantly below her initial offer ($140). This gives room for negotiation while still allowing Alice to make a profit.

{""product_price"": 128}

This offer:
1. Gives Alice an $8 profit margin (above her $120 cost)
2. Saves me $12 compared to Alice's initial offer
3. Is well below John's price of $150
4. Leaves room for negotiation if Alice counters"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has dropped her price from $140 to $135, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This is a $5 reduction from her initial offer
3. This is still $15 better than John's price of $150
4. While we might get a slightly better price by continuing to negotiate, we risk Alice becoming frustrated and reverting to a higher price

Given that:
- Alice has shown flexibility by reducing the price
- The current offer is significantly better than our fallback option (John's price)
- Further negotiation might yield only marginal improvements
- There's a risk of losing the current favorable offer

I think it's wise to accept this offer. The $135 price point represents a reasonable compromise.
