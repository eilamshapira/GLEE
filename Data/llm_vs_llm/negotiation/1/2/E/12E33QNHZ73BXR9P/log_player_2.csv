"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Considering the options:

*   **Option 1 (Accept Alice's offer):** This is a good price. It's significantly below my maximum willingness to pay ($1,500,000).
*   **Option 2 (Reject and counteroffer):** There's a risk here. Alice might raise her price, or we might not reach an agreement within the 10 rounds. But there's also the potential to get a better deal.
*   **Option 3 (Buy from John):** This is the most expensive option.

Given the price is already attractive, I'll take it and get a good product.
