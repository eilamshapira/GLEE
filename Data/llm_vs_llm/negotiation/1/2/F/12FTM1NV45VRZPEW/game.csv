"Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase our exclusive product at a special price. Given its unique value and benefits, I believe it would be a great addition to your portfolio. What do you say to acquiring it for $2000000?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, that price is significantly higher than I had budgeted. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $400000.",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value this product brings is substantial. Considering your offer, I'm willing to lower my price to $1500000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but the gap between our valuations is still quite large.  If you're serious about making a deal, I could consider $550000. Otherwise, I might need to explore other options.",550000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see that we're still apart on the valuation. I'm willing to meet you halfway by offering the product for $1300000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. Let me know if this works for you.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for continuing this discussion. While I appreciate you meeting me halfway from your previous offer, $1300000 is still significantly higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  To be frank, I'm only willing to go as high as $650000.  If that's not workable for you, I understand, but I need to be realistic with my budget.",650000.0,Bob,6,
