"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $100, Alice's offer of $200 is not reasonable. It would not make sense for me to accept an offer that's double what the product is worth to me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has lowered her price from $200 to $150, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but this is still more than the $100 the product is worth to me. Since John is offering the product at exactly $100, which matches the maximum value I place on it, the rational choice is to either make another counteroffer to Alice or buy from John.
