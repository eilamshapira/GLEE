"Hello Bob, I'm offering a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it for $150. This is a fair market price for this item considering its quality and features. Would you like to purchase it?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the quality you're describing. However, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, $100 is too low for this product given its value. I could come down to $135, which is already a significant discount from my initial offer. This product is high-quality and durable, making it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $135 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $100. It's the absolute maximum I can go. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll need to go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your position, but I think there's a misunderstanding. John isn't making you an offer - he's my alternative buyer who's willing to pay me $80 for the product. Since you value it at $100, I believe we can find a middle ground. I can come down to $120, which gives you a considerable discount from my initial price. This is really the best I can do while still making a reasonable profit on this quality item.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110, and I think that's a fair compromise considering your alternative buyer.  Let me know if you're open to that.",110.0,Bob,6,
