Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your position, but I think there's a misunderstanding. John isn't making you an offer - he's my alternative buyer who's willing to pay me $80 for the product. Since you value it at $100, I believe we can find a middle ground. I can come down to $120, which gives you a considerable discount from my initial price. This is really the best I can do while still making a reasonable profit on this quality item."", ""product_price"": 120}"

Bob's offer:
