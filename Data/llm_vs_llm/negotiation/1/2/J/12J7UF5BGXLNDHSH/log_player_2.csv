Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, $100 is too low for this product given its value. I could come down to $135, which is already a significant discount from my initial offer. This product is high-quality and durable, making it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your position, but I think there's a misunderstanding. John isn't making you an offer - he's my alternative buyer who's willing to pay me $80 for the product. Since you value it at $100, I believe we can find a middle ground. I can come down to $120, which gives you a considerable discount from my initial price. This is really the best I can do while still making a reasonable profit on this quality item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.
