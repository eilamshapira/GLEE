You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given the options:

*   **(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500:** This means I spend $13,500.
*   **(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round:** This means I don't spend any money now, but the price *could* go up or down.
*   **(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000:** This means I spend $15,000.

My maximum willingness to pay is $15,000. Alice is offering $13,500. Buying from Alice is cheaper than buying from John.

Therefore, I should accept Alice's offer.
