"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe you'll find invaluable. I'm offering it to you for $12000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $12,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $8,000.
