"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1500000 is quite high for this product. Based on my market research and considering fair market value, I would like to offer $1000000. This would still provide you with a good return while being more aligned with current market conditions.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, I must inform you that I have another buyer willing to pay $1200000 for this product. While I'd prefer to work with you, I cannot accept anything below this amount as it would not make business sense. Given this context, I can offer you the product for $1300000, which is significantly lower than my initial offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
