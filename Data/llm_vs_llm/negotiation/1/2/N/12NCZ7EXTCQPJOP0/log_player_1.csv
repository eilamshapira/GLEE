"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1500000 is quite high for this product. Based on my market research and considering fair market value, I would like to offer $1000000. This would still provide you with a good return while being more aligned with current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer. While I appreciate Bob's interest, $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable price considering the product's true value. Since I know I can get $1,200,000 from John, any offer below that isn't worth considering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, I must inform you that I have another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product. While I'd prefer to work with you, I cannot accept anything below this amount as it would not make business sense. Given this context, I can offer you the product for $1,300,000, which is significantly lower than my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
