"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1500000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000), I should either make a counteroffer or buy from John. Since I have negotiation rounds available and there's potential to get a better price from Alice, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still reasonable given that the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,500,000 is quite high for this product. Based on my market research and considering fair market value, I would like to offer $1,000,000. This would still provide you with a good return while being more aligned with current market conditions."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, I must inform you that I have another buyer willing to pay $1200000 for this product. While I'd prefer to work with you, I cannot accept anything below this amount as it would not make business sense. Given this context, I can offer you the product for $1300000, which is significantly lower than my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice is still asking for $1,300,000, which is $100,000 more than both my maximum value and John's price, and she's revealed that she has another buyer at $1,200,000 (which matches John's price), there's no reason to continue negotiating. I can get the same product from John for $1,200,000, which is my maximum value and matches Alice's other buyer's price.
