"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value you see in the product, but I have a budget limit to consider. I can offer $800000 for it. Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $2200000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",2200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your consideration, Alice. However, $2200000 is still beyond my budget. How about we agree on $900000? I believe this is a fair price that considers both our interests.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product's value is not reflected in your offer. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer the product to you for $1800000. If this is still not within your budget, I'm open to further negotiations, but I do have other options to consider.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
