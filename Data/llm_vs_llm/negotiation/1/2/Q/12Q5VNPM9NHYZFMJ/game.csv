"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, the price point you've presented is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to $600000. I believe this reflects a fair price considering potential market fluctuations.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand budget constraints, but I need to consider my bottom line as well. The product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I have another buyer (John) willing to pay that amount. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can come down to $1200000, which represents a $300000 reduction from my initial offer. This is still a great value considering the product's potential.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $1200000 is still a significant stretch for me. To be completely transparent, I have another offer available at a lower price point.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product, while also acknowledging my budgetary limits.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for increasing your offer, which shows your genuine interest. However, I need to be straightforward - the product is worth $1000000 to me, and I already have John willing to pay exactly that amount. I'm still interested in working with you, but I can't go below my minimum valuation. My best offer is $1050000, which is just slightly above what I could get elsewhere. This represents a substantial reduction from my previous offers. I hope we can reach an agreement, but I need to prioritize my bottom line.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other offers, but I'm reaching my upper limit for this purchase.  I'm willing to move to $750000. I believe this is a fair offer considering we're both coming down in price.  However, I need to be upfront - if we can't agree on this amount, I'll have to seriously consider the other offer I've received.",750000.0,Bob,6,
