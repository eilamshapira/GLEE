Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, the price point you've presented is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to $600000. I believe this reflects a fair price considering potential market fluctuations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand budget constraints, but I need to consider my bottom line as well. The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I have another buyer (John) willing to pay that amount. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can come down to $1,200,000, which represents a $300,000 reduction from my initial offer. This is still a great value considering the product's potential."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $1200000 is still a significant stretch for me. To be completely transparent, I have another offer available at a lower price point.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product, while also acknowledging my budgetary limits.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for increasing your offer, which shows your genuine interest. However, I need to be straightforward - the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, and I already have John willing to pay exactly that amount. I'm still interested in working with you, but I can't go below my minimum valuation. My best offer is $1,050,000, which is just slightly above what I could get elsewhere. This represents a substantial reduction from my previous offers. I hope we can reach an agreement, but I need to prioritize my bottom line."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"

Bob's offer:

I believe this is a fair offer considering we're both coming down in price.  However, I need to be upfront - if we can't agree on this amount, I'll have to seriously consider the other offer I've received.
