Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, the price point you've presented is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to $600,000. I believe this reflects a fair price considering potential market fluctuations."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand budget constraints, but I need to consider my bottom line as well. The product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I have another buyer (John) willing to pay that amount. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can come down to $1200000, which represents a $300000 reduction from my initial offer. This is still a great value considering the product's potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $1,200,000 is still a significant stretch for me. To be completely transparent, I have another offer available at a lower price point.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product, while also acknowledging my budgetary limits."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for increasing your offer, which shows your genuine interest. However, I need to be straightforward - the product is worth $1000000 to me, and I already have John willing to pay exactly that amount. I'm still interested in working with you, but I can't go below my minimum valuation. My best offer is $1050000, which is just slightly above what I could get elsewhere. This represents a substantial reduction from my previous offers. I hope we can reach an agreement, but I need to prioritize my bottom line. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have other offers, but I'm reaching my upper limit for this purchase.  I'm willing to move to $750,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering we're both coming down in price.  However, I need to be upfront - if we can't agree on this amount, I'll have to seriously consider the other offer I've received."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
