Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000}

Rationale: Since I know that:
1. The product is worth $1,500,000 to me (my minimum price)
2. The product is only worth $800,000 to Bob
3. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $1,500,000

There's no reason for me to offer Bob a price below $1,500,000. Bob will reject this offer since it's well above his valuation of $800,000, but that's fine because I can then sell to John for $1,500,000. Any offer below $1,500,000 would just result in me making less money than I could get from John."
