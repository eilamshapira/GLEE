"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Looking at the options:

1. Alice is offering the product for $120
2. I can reject Alice's offer
3. I can buy from John for $150

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and Alice's offer of $120 is below that threshold and $30 cheaper than John's price, accepting Alice's offer would save me money.
