"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,500,000 is higher than my maximum value of $1,000,000, and it's also higher than John's price. It would be better to negotiate with Alice for a lower price or ultimately buy from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

I'll offer $800,000, which is below John's price of $1,000,000. This gives room for negotiation while potentially saving money compared to buying from John. If Alice rejects this offer, we can still negotiate further or ultimately go with John's option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's new offer of $1,200,000 is still above John's price of $1,000,000, it makes more financial sense to buy from John. Alice seems unwilling to go below John's price, so continuing negotiations would likely not be productive."
