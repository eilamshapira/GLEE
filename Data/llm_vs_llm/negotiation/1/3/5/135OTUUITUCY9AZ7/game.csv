,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $1200000. How about I meet you halfway at $1600000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Meeting halfway is a good start, but I was thinking more of a price closer to $1400000. This is still a premium price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm still looking for a better price. How about $1550000? I believe that's a fair compromise for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I see we're getting closer to an agreement, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1550000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so how about $1525000? This is my best offer so far, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",1525000.0,Bob,6,
