"Hello Bob, I'm reaching out to offer you a product that I believe could be of interest to you. I'm currently asking for $12000 for this item, which represents its market value. However, I value our potential business relationship and am willing to offer you a special price of $10500. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another buyer, John, who is prepared to purchase it at $10000. I wanted to give you the first opportunity before finalizing the sale with him.",10500.0,Alice,1,
