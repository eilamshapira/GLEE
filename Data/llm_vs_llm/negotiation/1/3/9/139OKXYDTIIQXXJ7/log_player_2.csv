"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Looking at my options, I need to consider which choice is most beneficial for me.

I'm willing to pay up to $80 for this product (that's its maximum worth to me).

Alice's offer is $150, which is significantly above my maximum value of $80.

John is offering the product for exactly $80, which matches my maximum value.

Since Alice's price ($150) is much higher than John's price ($80), and John's price is exactly at my maximum value threshold, I should buy from John to save money.
