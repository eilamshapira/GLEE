"Bob, I'm excited about the potential for you to acquire this incredible asset. Given its unique value and the significant benefits it will bring to your operations, I'm offering it to you for $1550000. I'm confident you'll see the immense value it holds.",1550000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that initial offer is quite high.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for both of us. I'm willing to offer $650000.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but my initial price reflects the true worth of this product. I can come down a bit, but $650000 is far too low. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1475000?",1475000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but we're still quite far apart. To be frank, I'm aiming for something closer to the $700000 range. Would you be willing to consider $725000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $725000 is still significantly below my bottom line. Given the value this brings to your operations, I'm willing to lower my price to $1400000. This is a substantial reduction and a great opportunity for you.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm starting to get concerned about the gap between us. While I see the value in this product, I have a budget I need to stick to. I can go up to $750000, but that's my absolute limit. If we can't agree on something close to this, I may have to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
