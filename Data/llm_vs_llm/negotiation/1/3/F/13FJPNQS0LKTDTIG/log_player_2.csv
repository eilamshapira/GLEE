"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $150 is higher than my maximum valuation of $100, and it's also higher than John's price of $100. It would not be rational to accept this offer. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}

I'll offer $80, which is below John's price of $100. This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to save money compared to buying from John. If Alice rejects this offer, we can still negotiate further, or I always have the option to go with John's $100 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $130 is still above both my maximum valuation ($100) and John's price ($100). There's no reason to accept this offer when I can either get a better deal through further negotiation or simply buy from John for $100. I'll reject and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 85}

I'll slightly increase my previous offer to $85, showing some willingness to negotiate while still staying well below John's price of $100. This gives Alice room to make a profit while potentially giving me a better deal than John's offer. If Alice rejects this offer, I can either continue negotiating or fall back on John's $100 offer."
