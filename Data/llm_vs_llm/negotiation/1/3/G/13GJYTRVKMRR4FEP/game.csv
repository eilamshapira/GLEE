,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. However, I cannot accept $600000. How about we settle at $1300000? I believe it's a fair price for such a valuable product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1300000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $700000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the market value.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $700000 is still too low for me. I'd like to propose a new price of $1250000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product. Let me know your thoughts!",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $1250000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $875000. This is the highest I'm comfortable going.",875000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a common ground. However, I cannot accept $875000. I am willing to settle at $1200000, which is the minimum price I can go for this product. Please consider this offer.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
