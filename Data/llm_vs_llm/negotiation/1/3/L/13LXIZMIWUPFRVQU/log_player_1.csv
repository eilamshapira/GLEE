Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my strategy carefully here. Bob values the product at $800,000, which is the same as my minimum acceptable value. I also have a guaranteed backup buyer (John) who will pay $800,000.

Since Bob and I value the product equally, Bob would only accept an offer at or below $800,000. If I offer exactly $800,000, Bob would be indifferent between accepting and rejecting (since he gains no surplus). In this case, I would earn the same amount whether Bob accepts or John buys it.

Given that I'm guaranteed $800,000 from John, there's no reason for me to offer Bob anything lower than $800,000.
