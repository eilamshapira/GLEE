"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given that Alice's offer is $250, which is much higher than the product's worth to me ($80) and also higher than John's offer ($80), it doesn't make sense to accept it. I should either make a counteroffer to Alice or buy from John.

Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum valuation of $80, I have nothing to lose by making a counteroffer to Alice first. If I can get Alice to sell for less than $80, that would be better than buying from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice that's significantly lower than her initial price but still gives room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": $50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has reduced her price from $250 to $150, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $150 is still higher than the product's worth to me ($80) and higher than John's offer ($80). 

I should reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer. Since we still have several rounds of negotiation left, I have room to try to get Alice's price below $80.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $250 to $150, she's showing significant flexibility. I'll increase my offer a bit from the previous $50, but still aim to get a better deal than John's $80 offer.
