Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1600000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only consider it if the price is significantly lower. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, Bob, I understand your position. However, my valuation of the product is considerably higher than your offer. I am willing to come down from my initial price, but $600,000 is too low. I am willing to lower the price, but I cannot go below my minimum value of $1,200,000.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't accept $600,000. Considering its unique value, I can go down to a price of: "", ""product_price"": 1400000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $1400000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still below it. I could try to negotiate further, but at this point, I need to consider the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of a deal falling through and potentially getting less than what I know I can get.

I choose to sell to John.
