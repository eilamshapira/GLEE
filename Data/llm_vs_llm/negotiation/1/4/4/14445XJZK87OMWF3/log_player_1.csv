Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider this situation carefully. 

Bob values the product at $1,000,000, which means he won't pay more than that amount. Meanwhile, I have John willing to pay $1,500,000, which is also my minimum acceptable value for the product.

Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and John is willing to pay exactly that amount, there's no incentive for me to sell to Bob for less. Bob cannot offer me anything better than what John is already offering.

The logical decision is to make an offer to Bob that I know he will reject, so I can proceed with selling to John for $1,500,000.
