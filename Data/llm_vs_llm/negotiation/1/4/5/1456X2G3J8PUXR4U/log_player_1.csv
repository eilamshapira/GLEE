Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $1200000 is the absolute maximum I could pay for it, and I can actually get it from another seller at that same price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $800000, which I believe is fair considering market conditions. This gives you a guaranteed sale now rather than having to find another buyer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
