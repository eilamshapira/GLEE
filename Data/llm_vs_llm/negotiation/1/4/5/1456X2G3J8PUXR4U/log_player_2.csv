"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Given its rarity and high demand, I believe it's worth a premium price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000, which I think is a fair value considering its unique features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she's asking for $1,200,000 which is exactly the maximum value the product is worth to me. This is also the same price that John is willing to sell it for.

Since Alice is starting with her highest price possible (matching my maximum valuation), I should try to negotiate a better deal. There's no advantage to accepting this initial offer or buying from John when I might be able to get the product for less from Alice.

While I appreciate the product's quality, $1,200,000 is the absolute maximum I could pay for it, and I can actually get it from another seller at that same price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which I believe is fair considering market conditions.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must consider the product's true value and the fact that you mentioned being able to get it from another seller for $1200000. Given this information, I'm willing to compromise and offer you a better price than my initial one. I can sell the product to you for $1050000, which is still below the maximum price you mentioned. I believe this is a fair deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, now offering the product for $1,050,000, which is $150,000 less than both her initial price and John's alternative price. This is a good sign that she's willing to negotiate and may go lower.

Since the product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, getting it for $1,050,000 would save me $150,000. However, I think there's still room for further negotiation before accepting.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your offer of $1,050,000 is definitely better than my alternative option. However, I still believe we can find a price point that works even better for both of us. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $925,000. This gives you a quick sale at a fair price, and allows me some savings compared to my other option. Does this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 925000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I still believe the product's value is closer to my previous offer. Considering your alternative option is $1200000, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous price. I can sell the product to you for $1000000, which is still a better deal for you than your other option. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price again to $1,000,000, which is now $200,000 less than John's price and my maximum valuation. She's showing willingness to negotiate but is slowing down in how much she's reducing her price (from a $150,000 reduction to just a $50,000 reduction).

This is a good offer that saves me a significant amount compared to my alternative. While I could try to negotiate further, the price has reached a nice round number at $1,000,000, and there's a risk that continuing to push might frustrate Alice.

Given that I can save $200,000 compared to buying from John or accepting Alice's initial offer, this seems like a good deal.
