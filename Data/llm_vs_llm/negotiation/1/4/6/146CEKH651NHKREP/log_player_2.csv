"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer is $120, which is the same price as John's offer and equal to my maximum value for the product, I am indifferent between accepting Alice's offer or buying from John. Both options would cost me $120. Since there's no price advantage either way, I might as well accept Alice's offer.
