"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering this exclusive product for $121. If you're interested, let me know—otherwise, I'll be proceeding with another buyer at a set price. Thanks for your time! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $121. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $121
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $100
2. Alice's offer is $121, which is above my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $100, which equals my maximum value
4. If I accept Alice's offer, I would be paying $21 more than my maximum value
5. If I buy from John, I would be paying exactly my maximum value

Since Alice's offer ($121) is above my maximum value ($100), and John is offering the same product at a better price ($100), the rational decision would be to buy from John.
