Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $1,500,000 minimum to me
2. The product is worth $800,000 to Bob
3. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $1,500,000

Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, and Bob values the product at only $800,000, there's no reason for me to offer the product to Bob at any price below $1,500,000. Bob won't accept a price above his valuation of $800,000, but that's fine because I can sell to John instead.
