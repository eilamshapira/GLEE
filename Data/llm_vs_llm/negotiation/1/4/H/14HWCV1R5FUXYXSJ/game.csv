"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  However, $9000 is significantly below my bottom line. Could you do $11000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a worthwhile investment at that price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 was a bit low, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10000. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
