"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my premium product to you for $11000. This is a great opportunity for both of us to benefit. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $11,000 is less than that, it's a good deal. However, I want to save as much money as I can. 

Considering Alice's offer is close to the maximum I'm willing to pay, and buying from John would cost me even more ($12,000), I should try to negotiate or reject the offer to see if Alice can provide a better price. But since the instructions are to either accept, reject, or buy from John without mentioning negotiation, I will choose to reject the offer for now, hoping Alice might reconsider and offer a lower price, or I might end up buying from John if no better deal is available.
