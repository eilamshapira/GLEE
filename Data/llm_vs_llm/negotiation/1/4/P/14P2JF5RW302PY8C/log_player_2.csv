"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative price ($8,000). It would be irrational to accept this offer as it would result in a loss. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll offer a price below my maximum value, leaving room for negotiation while still trying to get a good deal.

{""product_price"": 6000}

This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $12,000, but it gives room for negotiation. Since I know the product is worth $10,000 to Alice and I'm not willing to pay more than $8,000, I'm starting with a lower offer to give space for back-and-forth negotiation. If Alice doesn't accept, I still have the option to go to John's fixed price of $8,000 later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $11,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). While Alice has reduced the price from the initial $12,000, it's still not a reasonable offer from my perspective. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement soon, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still stay well below my maximum value.

{""product_price"": 7000}

I'm increasing my offer by $1,000 from my previous offer to show willingness to negotiate, but I'm still keeping it below my maximum value of $8,000. This offer gives Alice a chance to make a profit above her $10,000 cost if she can find other buyers, while still being attractive to me. If Alice doesn't accept, I still have John's offer of $8,000 as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price that would be acceptable to me (under $8,000). While Alice has gradually reduced her price from $12,000 to $10,500, she's still asking for significantly more than my maximum value and more than John's price. Since Alice seems unlikely to drop her price below John's $8,000 offer (especially since the product is worth $10,000 to her), the most rational decision is to take John's guaranteed offer of $8,000 rather than continue negotiating."
