Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my options carefully here. The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price. Bob values the product at only $800,000, which is less than my minimum acceptable price.

Since Bob won't pay more than what the product is worth to him ($800,000), and this is below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), there's no point in offering Bob a price he might accept. The economically rational decision is to sell to John at my minimum acceptable price.
