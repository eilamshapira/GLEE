"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you made a counteroffer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $140. It's a great price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $140 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $130? That way, we're both moving closer to a deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer to a deal. I appreciate your willingness to move up to $130. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I still think the product is worth a bit more than that. How about we meet at $135? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,5,
