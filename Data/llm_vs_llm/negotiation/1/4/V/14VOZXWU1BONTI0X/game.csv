"Hello Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's a unique piece with a lot of potential. I'm asking for $10000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's unique qualities, $10000 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller offering the same product for $8000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $6500? This would be a fair price that works within my budget.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $6500 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it for $8250.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me.",8250.0,Alice,3,
