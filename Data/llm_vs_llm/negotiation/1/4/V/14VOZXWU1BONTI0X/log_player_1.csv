"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's unique qualities, $10000 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller offering the same product for $8000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $6500? This would be a fair price that works within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
