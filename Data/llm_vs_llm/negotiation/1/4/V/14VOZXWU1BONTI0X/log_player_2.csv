"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's a unique piece with a lot of potential. I'm asking for $10000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: Alice's offer of $10,000 is higher than both:
1. My maximum valuation of the product ($8,000)
2. John's guaranteed price ($8,000)

It would be irrational to accept this offer. While I could make a counteroffer, I know I have John's offer as a backup. Let me try to negotiate with Alice first to see if I can get an even better price than John's $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's unique qualities, $10,000 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller offering the same product for $8,000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $6,500? This would be a fair price that works within my budget."", ""product_price"": 6500}

Reasoning: I'm employing a strategic negotiation approach here:
1. I'm starting with a lower offer ($6,500) to leave room for negotiation
2. I'm mentioning the competing offer of $8,000 to establish a credible ceiling
3. I'm being respectful and showing willingness to negotiate
4. The price I'm offering is significantly below John's price, giving room for back-and-forth negotiation while still potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's offer
5. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate up to a maximum of $8,000 (John's price) or walk away and take John's offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $6500 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it for $8250.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Reasoning: At this point, it's best to take John's offer because:
1. Alice's new offer ($8,250) is still above John's price ($8,000)
2. Alice's offer is also above my maximum valuation ($8,000)
3. While we could continue negotiating, Alice's current counteroffer suggests she's unlikely to go significantly below $8,000
4. Even if Alice eventually matches John's price, we wouldn't save any money
5. Continuing the negotiation might risk losing time without any potential benefit

Therefore, the rational choice is to take the guaranteed offer from John at $8,000."
