"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand that the product is unique and of high quality, but the price of $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $5000. I believe this is a fair price, considering my budget and the potential benefits I'll get from the product. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you see its potential benefits. However, I must say that $5000 is a bit lower than I was expecting. Considering the product's exceptional quality and uniqueness, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $18000. This price is still competitive, and I believe it reflects the product's true value. I'm open to further negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to propose a price of $6500. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",6500.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I must say that $6500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's exceptional quality and uniqueness, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $16000. This price is still competitive, and I believe it reflects the product's true value. I'm open to further negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts. If we can't meet in the middle, I do have other options to consider.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you have other options to consider, and I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. However, $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I'd like to propose a price of $7250. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If we can't agree on a price, I do have the option to buy the product from another seller, John, for $8000, which is still within my budget. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement before exploring other options.",7250.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I must say that $7250 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's exceptional quality and uniqueness, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $14000. This price is still competitive, and I believe it reflects the product's true value. I want to remind you that I do have other options, and I'm not willing to go much lower than this. If you're serious about purchasing the product, I encourage you to consider this offer carefully.",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're not willing to go much lower than $14000, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'd like to propose a price of $8000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and it's also the price that another seller, John, is offering me. If you're willing to match this price, I'm ready to make a deal. If not, I'll have to consider purchasing from John.",8000.0,Bob,8,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I must say that $8000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's exceptional quality and uniqueness, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $11000. This price is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer who is willing to meet my minimum price. I hope we can come to an agreement, but I'm prepared to move on if necessary.",11000.0,Alice,9,
