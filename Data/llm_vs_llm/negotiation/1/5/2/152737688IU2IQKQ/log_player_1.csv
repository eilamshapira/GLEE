"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $5,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $12,000, there's no reason to accept such a low offer. However, I'll reject and make a counteroffer since there might still be room for a better deal with Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still maintain a price well above my minimum to leave room for negotiation while signaling that I won't accept very low offers.

{""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's second offer of $6,000 shows only a small increase from his first offer of $5,000, and it's still well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I could continue negotiating, Bob's small incremental increase suggests he might not be willing to reach a price that would be better than John's guaranteed offer of $12,000. At this point, it's prudent to secure the guaranteed sale to John.
