"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I know would be a great investment for you. Given its unique value proposition and market potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. This price reflects the product's true worth while still leaving room for you to generate significant value."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I was hoping we could negotiate a lower price. Would you consider $1000000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly at my minimum acceptable price and matches John's offer, but I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so there's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's true value. Given that this product will provide substantial returns on your investment, I can adjust my price to $1,100,000, which represents a fair middle ground and still ensures good value for you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I am still looking for a better deal. Would you consider $1050000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,050,000. This price is $50,000 better than John's standing offer, and while we might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely if we push too hard. This represents a reasonable compromise and ensures a profitable transaction."
