"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
2. Alice's offer is $11,500
3. John's fixed price is $12,000
4. The product is worth $8,000 to Alice

Alice's offer of $11,500 is quite high, especially knowing that the product is worth $8,000 to her. There's significant room for negotiation since she has a $3,500 margin between her cost ($8,000) and her offer ($11,500).

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as:
- It's better than John's price ($12,000)
- There's room for negotiation since Alice has a large margin
- If negotiations fail, I can still buy from John at $12,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but gives me a better deal:

{""product_price"": 9500}

This counteroffer is strategic because:
1. It's significantly above Alice's cost ($8,000), so she can still make a good profit ($1,500)
2. It's much better for me than both her offer ($11,500) and John's price ($12,000)
3. It leaves room for negotiation if Alice wants to counter
4. It's a substantial drop from her initial offer, but not so low as to be insulting or unreasonable"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let's analyze Alice's new offer:

1. Alice has dropped from $11,500 to $10,750 (a $750 reduction)
2. This shows she's willing to negotiate and has significant room to move
3. The new price is still $2,750 above her cost ($8,000)
4. It's better than John's price ($12,000)
5. We started at $11,500, I offered $9,500, and she's now at $10,750

Since she made a meaningful reduction and showed willingness to negotiate, I should continue negotiating. There's still room for a better price, and I have John's offer as a backup.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still try to get a good deal:

{""product_price"": 10000}

This counteroffer is strategic because:
1. It's a $500 increase from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to be reasonable and move towards middle ground
2. It still gives me a good deal compared to both Alice's current offer ($10,750) and John's price ($12,000)
3. It provides Alice with a $2,000 profit margin over her cost ($8,000), which is substantial
4. It leaves room for further negotiation while showing good faith
5. We're getting closer to finding a middle ground that could work for both parties"
