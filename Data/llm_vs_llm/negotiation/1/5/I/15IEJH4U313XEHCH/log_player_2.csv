"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you. I think it could be really valuable to you. I'm asking $300 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","The product is worth no more than $150 to me, and Alice is asking for $300. That's way too high. I'm not going to pay that much. I'll buy from John for $150 instead.
