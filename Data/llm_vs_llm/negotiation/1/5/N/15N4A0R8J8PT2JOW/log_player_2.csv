"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to consider my options carefully here.

1. If I accept Alice's offer, I'd pay $12,500 for a product that's worth at most $10,000 to me. That means I'd be losing at least $2,500 in value.

2. If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $10,000, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me.

Since the product is only worth $10,000 to me and John is offering exactly that price, it makes the most sense to buy from John rather than paying $12,500 to Alice.
