"Alice, I appreciate your detailed offer. However, given my budget constraints and other alternatives, I'm only comfortable moving forward at $700000. Would you be open to discussing the product at that price?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. However, $700000 falls significantly short of the product's true value. It's a valuable asset with a proven track record. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer a slight adjustment, bringing the price down to $900000. This reflects a compromise while still acknowledging the product's worth. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",900000.0,Alice,3,
