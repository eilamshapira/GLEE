Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider the situation carefully. 

Bob values the product at $80, which means he won't pay more than that amount. The product is worth at least $150 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay exactly $150.

Since any price I could offer Bob that he would accept ($80 or less) would be significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150, and I have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, the rational choice is to make an offer that maintains my relationship with Bob but that I know he will reject.
