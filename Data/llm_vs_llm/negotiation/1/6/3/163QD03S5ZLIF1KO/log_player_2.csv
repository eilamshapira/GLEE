"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $900,000
2. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
3. John is willing to sell it for $800,000
4. Alice's price is $100,000 higher than John's price

Since Alice's offer ($900,000) is:
- Higher than the product's worth to me ($800,000)
- Higher than John's alternative offer ($800,000)

It makes no economic sense to accept Alice's offer. While I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, I already have a guaranteed option to buy at $800,000 from John, which matches my maximum valuation. There's no reason to continue negotiating when I have a readily available optimal solution.
