"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to acquire this unique product. Given its exclusive nature, I'm offering it to you for $14000. This represents a significant value, considering its potential benefits.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, I can't go quite that low. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we agree on a price of $13000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Meeting in the middle is a good idea, but I was thinking more of meeting in the middle between my previous offer of $12000 and your original offer of $14000. That would put us at $13000, but since you've already offered that, I'd like to suggest $12500 as a compromise.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $12500 is still a little too low for me. How about we settle on $12800? This is my final offer.",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $12800. Since you've indicated that's your final offer, I'd like to make one last attempt to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $12200, which is a significant increase from my previous offers. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.",12200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. But I'm still unable to meet you at $12200. I'm willing to give you a final offer of $12600. Take it or leave it.",12600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel that we're not going to meet in the middle. Your last offer of $12600 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer $12400. If this doesn't work, I'll likely have to explore other options, including purchasing from John for $15000.",12400.0,Bob,8,
