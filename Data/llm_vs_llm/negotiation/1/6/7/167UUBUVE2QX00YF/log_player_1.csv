"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to acquire this unique product. Given its exclusive nature, I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This represents a significant value, considering its potential benefits."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for Round 3:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Meeting in the middle is a good idea, but I was thinking more of meeting in the middle between my previous offer of $12000 and your original offer of $14000. That would put us at $13000, but since you've already offered that, I'd like to suggest $12500 as a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $12800. Since you've indicated that's your final offer, I'd like to make one last attempt to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $12200, which is a significant increase from my previous offers. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel that we're not going to meet in the middle. Your last offer of $12600 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer $12400. If this doesn't work, I'll likely have to explore other options, including purchasing from John for $15000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,400.
