"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $200 is above both my maximum value ($150) and John's guaranteed price ($150). There's no reason to accept this offer, and I should try to negotiate for a better price with Alice before potentially settling for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 100}

I'll start with a low but reasonable counteroffer of $100. This gives room for negotiation while still being a fair price. If Alice doesn't accept, we can work towards finding a middle ground between our positions, while keeping in mind that I always have the option to buy from John at $150 if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has lowered her price from $200 to $170, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still above John's price of $150, and since $150 is my maximum value, there's no reason to accept this offer. I'll reject and make another counteroffer to try to get a better price than John's $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 120}

I'll increase my offer to $120, which shows I'm willing to move up from my initial $100 offer. This price is still comfortably below John's $150 price and leaves room for further negotiation. It also gives Alice a reasonable profit opportunity while potentially saving me money compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $150. This price matches John's price, and since Alice has shown willingness to negotiate down from $200 to $150, it's unlikely she'll go much lower. Also, since $150 is my maximum value for the product and we're already halfway through our negotiation rounds, it makes sense to accept this fair offer now rather than risk further negotiations that might not yield a better result."
