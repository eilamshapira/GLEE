"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm very pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this extraordinary product. Considering its unique value and the benefits it offers, I believe a price of $950000 is a fair and advantageous proposition for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","The product is worth $1,000,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $950,000. I could buy it from John for $1,000,000.

Since Alice's offer is less than what the product is worth to me, and lower than John's price, I should accept it.
