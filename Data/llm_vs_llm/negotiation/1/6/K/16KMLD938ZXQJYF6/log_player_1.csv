Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product quality, $8000 is a bit steep for my budget. I would be willing to pay $6500 for the product. This is a fair offer considering market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand where you're coming from, but given the quality of the product and current market conditions, I can only part with the product at a minimum of $8,000.
