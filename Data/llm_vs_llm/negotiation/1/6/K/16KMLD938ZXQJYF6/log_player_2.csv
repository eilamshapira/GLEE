"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a top-quality product available and I'm offering it to you at $8000. Let me know if you're ready to move forward! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's offer is $8,000, which is the same price as John's offer, and the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, I should try to negotiate for a better price with Alice first. There's no risk in rejecting this offer because I can always buy from John later at the same price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product quality, $8,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I would be willing to pay $6,500 for the product. This is a fair offer considering market conditions."", ""product_price"": 6500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand where you're coming from, but given the quality of the product and current market conditions, I can only part with the product at a minimum of $8000. Let me know if you can meet that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice seems firm on her $8,000 price and has explicitly stated it's her minimum, and considering we have John's offer at the same price, there's no point in continuing the negotiation if Alice won't budge. At this point, I might as well buy from John since there's no indication Alice will go lower.
