"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, there's no reason to accept an offer that's half of that amount. However, since I still have 8 rounds left for negotiation, I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still maintain a price well above my minimum to leave room for negotiation.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob has only increased his offer by $100,000, and it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While we still have 6 rounds left, Bob's small increment suggests he might not be willing to reach my minimum price. However, I'll make one more attempt at negotiation before considering selling to John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price more significantly to show willingness to negotiate, but still maintain it above my minimum acceptable price.

{""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offers are showing very small increments ($50,000 this time), and we're already in round 6. With only 4 rounds left and Bob still $450,000 below my minimum acceptable price, it seems unlikely that we'll reach an agreement that's better than John's guaranteed offer. At this point, it's best to take the sure deal with John rather than risk more time in negotiations that don't seem promising.
