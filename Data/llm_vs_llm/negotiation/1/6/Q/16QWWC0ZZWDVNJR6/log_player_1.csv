Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Considering my options:

*   **Accepting Bob's offer:** This nets me $900,000, which is more than the $800,000 I'd get from John.
*   **Rejecting and Counteroffering:** This could potentially lead to a higher price, but also risks Bob walking away or me ending up with less.
*   **Selling to John:** This guarantees $800,000.

Given that I want to maximize my earnings and Bob's counteroffer is already above my minimum price, I will choose to **Reject and proceed to the next round.**

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, I'm going to make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price that's higher than his last offer but still likely to be accepted.

```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Okay, let's analyze the situation again:

*   **Accepting Bob's offer ($950,000):** This is the best option so far.
*   **Rejecting and Counteroffering:** This is riskier. Bob might walk away or lower his offer.
*   **Selling to John ($800,000):** A significantly lower outcome.

Since Bob's offer is already above my minimum price and offers the best current return, I will **accept Bob's offer**.
