Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $5,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($15,000), I will reject his offer.

Also, selling to John for $15,000 is still an option, but I want to try to get a better price from Bob.

So, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's still high, but slightly lower than my initial offer, to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $6,000 is still significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($15,000). While it's slightly better than his previous offer, it's still not acceptable to me.

I'll reject Bob's offer again and consider making another counteroffer. However, I'll also keep in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, which is still a better deal than Bob's current offer.

For now, I'll proceed to the next round and try to negotiate a better price with Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make another counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one, to see if Bob is willing to meet me at a higher price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $7,000 is still lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($15,000), but it's getting closer to a reasonable range.

However, I still think I can get a better price from Bob, and I'm not willing to sell the product for $7,000.

At this point, I'm starting to consider selling to John for $15,000 as a more attractive option, since it's still a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum value.

But I'll give Bob one more chance to meet me at a higher price. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $7,500 is still lower than the price I was hoping to get, but it's getting closer.

However, since my minimum value for the product is $15,000, and Bob's offer is still significantly lower than that, I'm starting to think that selling to John for $15,000 is the better option.

I've already made several concessions and counteroffers, and Bob hasn't met me at a price that I'm comfortable with. At this point, I think it's unlikely that he'll be willing to pay $15,000 or more.

So, I've decided to stop negotiating with Bob and sell the product to John for $15,000, which is a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum value.
