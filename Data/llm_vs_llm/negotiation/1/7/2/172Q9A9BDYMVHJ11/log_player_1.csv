"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since the product is worth no less than $120 to me, I will not accept Bob's offer of $100.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $100 and my initial offer was $200, I'll try to find a middle ground while still aiming to earn as much as possible.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $130 is higher than the minimum value of $120 that I'm willing to accept, and it's also higher than John's offer, I'll consider accepting it. However, I'll try to squeeze out a bit more value.

But considering the risk of losing the deal if I reject Bob's offer, and the fact that $130 is a reasonable price, I'll choose to accept Bob's offer.
