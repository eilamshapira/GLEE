"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I certainly understand that the initial asking price might be a bit high, but I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties. Would you consider a price of $16,000?"
