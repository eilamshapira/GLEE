"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $12,000, and it's also higher than John's price of $12,000. It would not be rational to accept this offer. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 11000}

I'll offer $11,000 which is below my maximum value of $12,000. This gives some room for negotiation while still being potentially profitable for Alice (since the product is worth $15,000 to her). If Alice rejects this offer, I can either negotiate further or fall back to John's offer of $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's new offer of $16,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000). Given that Alice has only reduced her price from $18,000 to $16,000, and her counter to my $11,000 offer was still substantially high, it seems unlikely that she will reduce the price below John's offer of $12,000. Therefore, the most rational decision is to buy from John at $12,000."
