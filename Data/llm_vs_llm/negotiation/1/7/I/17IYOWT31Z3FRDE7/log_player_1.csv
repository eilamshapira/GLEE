Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has tremendous value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 5000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but I think the price is quite steep. I'm looking to spend no more than $600000 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $600,000 is below my target price, and I believe the product is worth more. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is an option, but I'd like to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you think the initial price is steep, but I believe the product's value lies in its uniqueness and potential. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm reducing the price, but not as low as you've suggested."", ""product_price"": 4000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the price is still much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I can increase my offer to $700000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. While Bob's offer is increasing, $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, I'll continue to try to get a better offer from Bob, but I'll also consider the number of rounds left and the potential for further negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, and I'm glad we're moving closer. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this unique product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and your current offer. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 3500000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but the price is still quite high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Although Bob's offer is getting closer to a million dollars, it's still below the price I can get from John. Since I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, I'll continue to try to get a better offer from Bob, but I need to be mindful of the remaining rounds and the potential for Bob to walk away. My next counteroffer will be more aggressive in trying to meet or exceed the $1,000,000 threshold."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, I need to emphasize that this product is highly valuable, and I have other interested buyers. I'm willing to make a significant concession, but I need you to meet me closer to my target price.
