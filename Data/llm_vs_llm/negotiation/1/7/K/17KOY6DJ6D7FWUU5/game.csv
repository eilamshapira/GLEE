"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I was hoping for a better price. Given the current market conditions, I'd like to propose $1050000 for the product. This would still provide you with a good profit while being more aligned with my budget constraints. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, I need to emphasize the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down from my initial price, but $1050000 is still too low considering the product's market value and potential. I can offer it at $1120000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and provides you with substantial value.",1120000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. That shows we're moving in the right direction. However, I still feel there's room for us to meet at a more mutually beneficial price point. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1075000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and would provide you with a good profit margin. I believe this is a fair price that works well for both of us, especially considering I could always go with John's offer if we can't reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. While we're getting closer, I believe we can find a middle ground that better reflects the product's value. I'm willing to further reduce my asking price to $1100000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and would still provide you with substantial value given the product's worth. This is a very competitive price point that I believe works well for both parties.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
