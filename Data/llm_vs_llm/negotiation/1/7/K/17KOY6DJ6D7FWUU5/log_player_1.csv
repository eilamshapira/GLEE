Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I was hoping for a better price. Given the current market conditions, I'd like to propose $1050000 for the product. This would still provide you with a good profit while being more aligned with my budget constraints. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a new counteroffer to Bob. While his offer of $1,050,000 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation given that the product is worth $1,200,000 to him."

I can offer it at $1,120,000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and provides you with substantial value."", ""product_price"": 1120000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. That shows we're moving in the right direction. However, I still feel there's room for us to meet at a more mutually beneficial price point. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1075000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and would provide you with a good profit margin. I believe this is a fair price that works well for both of us, especially considering I could always go with John's offer if we can't reach an agreement.

I will make another counteroffer. Bob has increased his offer, showing he has room to negotiate, and his mention of John isn't relevant since John's offer is lower. Given that the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, there's still potential to reach a better price point."

While we're getting closer, I believe we can find a middle ground that better reflects the product's value. I'm willing to further reduce my asking price to $1,100,000.
