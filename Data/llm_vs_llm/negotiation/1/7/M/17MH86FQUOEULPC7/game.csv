"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $110. ",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget concerns, I can't go as low as $110 as the product is worth significantly more. I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay $120. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can offer it to you for $135, which is already a good discount from my initial price.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $125? ",125.0,Bob,4,
