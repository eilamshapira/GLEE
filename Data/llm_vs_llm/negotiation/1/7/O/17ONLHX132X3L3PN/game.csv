"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",10000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $10000 is below my minimum threshold for this product. I'm willing to come down to $22000, considering your budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",22000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
