"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for a great price! How about we settle on $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- The product is worth up to $150 to me
- Alice offers it for $140
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $150

Since Alice's price ($140) is less than John's price ($150) and less than my maximum valuation ($150), it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer. This saves me $10 compared to buying from John.
