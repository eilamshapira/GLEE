"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is higher than my minimum price of $8,000 and lower than his maximum value of $15,000, I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.

My counteroffer is: $13,500

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer.
