"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer is $9,500, which is less than the $12,000 it would cost to buy from John (and also less than the maximum $12,000 value to me), I should accept Alice's offer. This allows me to purchase the product while saving $2,500 compared to buying from John.
