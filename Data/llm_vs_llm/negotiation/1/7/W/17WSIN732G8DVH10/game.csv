"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I was hoping for a more reasonable price given my budget. How about we consider a price of $12000 for the product?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest and counteroffer, Bob. While I understand budget constraints, I need to consider the true value of this product. I can come down significantly from my initial price, but $12000 is still a bit low. I can offer it to you for $15000, which I believe is a fair compromise between our positions.",15000.0,Alice,3,
