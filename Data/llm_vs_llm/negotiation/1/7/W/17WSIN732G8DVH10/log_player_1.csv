"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I am offering it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price for the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I was hoping for a more reasonable price given my budget. How about we consider a price of $12000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. While $12,000 is better than my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation given my initial offer and the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest and counteroffer, Bob. While I understand budget constraints, I need to consider the true value of this product. I can come down significantly from my initial price, but $12,000 is still a bit low. I can offer it to you for $15,000, which I believe is a fair compromise between our positions."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
