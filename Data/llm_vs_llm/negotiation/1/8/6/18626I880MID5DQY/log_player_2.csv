"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to analyze this offer carefully:

- The product is worth no more than $100 to me
- Alice is offering it for $120, which is $20 more than its value to me
- John is offering the exact same product for $100

Since Alice's price ($120) exceeds both my maximum valuation ($100) and John's alternative price ($100), it makes no sense to accept her offer. While I could try negotiating with Alice, John is already offering the product at what I consider fair value.
