"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price of $180 is higher than my maximum value of $150 and also higher than John's offer. It makes sense to reject and make a counteroffer to Alice. If we can't reach an agreement below $150, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 120}

I'll offer $120, which is below John's price of $150. This gives room for negotiation while potentially saving money compared to John's offer. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate upward while staying below $150, or ultimately go with John's offer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $170 is still above both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150). I'll reject and make another counteroffer. There's no reason to accept a price higher than what John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 130}

I'll increase my offer to $130, which is still below John's price but shows some movement toward meeting Alice in the middle. This gives Alice room to negotiate while keeping the price below my maximum value of $150. If Alice doesn't accept this or come back with a reasonable counter, I can still fall back on John's offer of $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer of $160 is still above John's price of $150. Since Alice has not come down to a price below John's offer after several rounds of negotiation, it makes more sense to simply buy from John at $150. There's no reason to pay more than $150 when we have a guaranteed option at that price."
