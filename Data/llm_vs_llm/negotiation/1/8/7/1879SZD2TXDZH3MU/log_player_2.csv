"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited about the possibility of you acquiring this product. It's truly exceptional and a valuable asset. I'm initially offering it to you for $1500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer ($1,500,000) is higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), it would not be rational to accept her offer. While I could try to negotiate with a counteroffer, I already know that John is willing to sell at my maximum acceptable price, which guarantees I can get the product without risking a failed negotiation.
