"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Considering its unique qualities and immense value, I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Given Bob's low offer of $600,000, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I believe I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. How about $1,400,000?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a tough decision. Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the same as what John is offering. I could accept Bob's offer and potentially make more in the future. However, if I keep negotiating with Bob I might end up with less money.

Since there is no guarantee of a higher offer from Bob in the future and I can avoid the risk of further negotiation by selling the product to John, I will sell the product to John.
