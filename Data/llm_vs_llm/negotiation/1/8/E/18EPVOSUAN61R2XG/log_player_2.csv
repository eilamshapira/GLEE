"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $1,500,000, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower, but still shows that I'm interested in the product. I'll offer $600,000, which is below my maximum budget of $800,000.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600000 is too low. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. How about $1400000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has come down from $1,500,000 to $1,400,000, which is a good sign. However, I still think the price is too high. I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer of $600,000 and her current offer of $1,400,000. A midpoint would be around $1,000,000.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
