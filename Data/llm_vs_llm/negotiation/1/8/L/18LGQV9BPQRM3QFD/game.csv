"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's quality, $17000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12500 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that you have a budget to consider, but I believe the product's value is higher than your offer. Let's meet in the middle at $15500. This way, we both make some concessions.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $13000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see that you're making an effort to find a suitable price point. I appreciate that. I'm willing to lower my offer to $15000. This price reflects the minimum value the product has for me.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a minimum price in mind, but $15000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13500. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point.",13500.0,Bob,6,
