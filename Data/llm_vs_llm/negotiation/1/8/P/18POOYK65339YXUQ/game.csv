"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $15000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and benefits.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $15000 is much higher than I am willing to pay. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to offer $8000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $8000 is significantly below the product's value. Given that I have another buyer willing to pay $12000, I cannot go below that price. However, I can reduce my initial asking price. I'm offering the product for $13000, which is a $2000 reduction from my initial offer.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $13000 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll increase my offer to $9000 to meet you halfway.",9000.0,Bob,4,
