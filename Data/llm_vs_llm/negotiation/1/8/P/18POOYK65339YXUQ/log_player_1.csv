"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $15,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and benefits."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $15000 is much higher than I am willing to pay. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to offer $8000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and even below his own valuation of $10,000, I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, so there might be room for negotiation, but I need to stay above my minimum threshold of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $8,000 is significantly below the product's value. Given that I have another buyer willing to pay $12,000, I cannot go below that price. However, I can reduce my initial asking price. I'm offering the product for $13,000, which is a $2,000 reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $13000 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll increase my offer to $9000 to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll choose to sell to John for $12,000. It's clear that Bob's maximum valuation is $10,000, and his current offer of $9,000 is still well below that. Even if we continue negotiating, we're unlikely to reach a price above $12,000 since that would exceed Bob's valuation. Therefore, it's most profitable to take John's guaranteed offer of $12,000 rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to yield a better outcome."
