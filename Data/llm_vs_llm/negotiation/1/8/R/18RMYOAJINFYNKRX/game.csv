"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $3000000 is way beyond my budget. I'm interested, but I can only offer $600000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $3000000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to counteroffer at $2000000, which I think is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2000000 is still far too high for me. My maximum budget for this product is $800000, and I'm prepared to buy it from another seller at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer $700000. This is my best offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget and your preference to work with me. I'm still a bit above your offer, but I'm trying to find a middle ground. I can offer the product for $1200000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
