Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 3000000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $3000000 is way beyond my budget. I'm interested, but I can only offer $600000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $600,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. My counteroffer will be $2,000,000. This price still reflects the product's value while giving Bob a chance to reconsider his budget."

I understand that $3,000,000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to counteroffer at $2,000,000, which I think is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2000000 is still far too high for me. My maximum budget for this product is $800000, and I'm prepared to buy it from another seller at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer $700000. This is my best offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob. Since Bob's maximum budget is $800,000 and he's willing to pay $700,000, I'll try to meet him in the middle. My counteroffer will be $1,200,000, but considering his budget constraint, I might be willing to go slightly lower in the next round if necessary. For now, I'll start with $1,200,000 to see if Bob is willing to stretch his budget or if he'll stick to his previous statement about buying from another seller at $800,000. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget and your preference to work with me. I'm still a bit above your offer, but I'm trying to find a middle ground.
