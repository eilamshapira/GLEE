"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer is $100, which is the same price as John's offer, and the product is worth $100 to me, there's no financial advantage in choosing one over the other. Both options would give me the same outcome.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer since it's equivalent to John's price, and there's no reason to reject it or specifically go to John."
