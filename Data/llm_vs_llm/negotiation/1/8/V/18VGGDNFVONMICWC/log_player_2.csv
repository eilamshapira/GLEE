"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since both Alice's offer and John's price are the same at $150, and this is exactly my maximum value for the product, I am indifferent between accepting Alice's offer or buying from John. There's no monetary advantage to choosing one over the other. I might as well accept Alice's offer since she made the effort to present it.
