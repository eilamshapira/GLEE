"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to consider that?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I can offer you a discount, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, how about $75? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $75 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can offer you another discount, how about we meet at $90? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",90.0,Alice,5,
