"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","I'll reject Bob's offer of $105. While it's above my minimum acceptable price of $100, I believe there's room to negotiate a better price since the product is worth $120 to Bob. I'll continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still try to get a better price than Bob's $105 offer.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob has increased his offer to $108, which is a good improvement from his previous $105. While I might be able to negotiate further, there's also a risk of Bob getting frustrated and backing out. $108 represents a good profit above my minimum price of $100, and it's a reasonable compromise point. I'll accept this offer.
