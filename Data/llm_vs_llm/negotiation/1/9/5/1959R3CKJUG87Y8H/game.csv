"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1800000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree there's definite value in the product, $1800000 is quite steep. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $500000.  What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response and acknowledging the product's value. I understand your perspective on the initial price.  While $500000 is quite low, I'm willing to work towards a mutually agreeable figure. How about we consider $1500000? This acknowledges the intrinsic worth while finding some middle ground.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. However, $1500000 is still too high for me. To be frank, anything above $700000 would make John's offer very tempting.  Could you do $600000?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate. I understand John's offer is a factor, however, the value of this product significantly exceeds his price. I can't go as low as $600000, but to demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I propose $1000000. This is a substantial adjustment on my end, reflecting my desire to see you acquire this.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the significant adjustment. It seems we're getting closer.  To bridge the gap, how about $750000? That's pushing my absolute limit, but I recognize the value proposition you've highlighted.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting closer. I appreciate you recognizing the value and stretching towards my position.  While $750000 is a significant jump from your initial offer, I need to hold firm at a minimum of $900000 for this to make sense on my end. I believe this price fairly reflects the value while acknowledging the progress we've made in our discussions.",900000.0,Alice,7,
