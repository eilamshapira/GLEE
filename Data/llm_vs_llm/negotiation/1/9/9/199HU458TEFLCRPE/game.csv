"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is way too high for me.  I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $50.",50.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the interest, Bob! $50 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hmm, $160 is still pretty steep.  I could maybe stretch my budget to $70, but that's absolutely my limit.",70.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offers. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to come down to $140. That's my final offer. Take it or leave it.",140.0,Alice,5,
