"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is well above my budget for this product. I know I can get the same product from John for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. I'm willing to offer $70 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to another seller. What do you think?",70.0,Bob,2,
