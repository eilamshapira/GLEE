Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking $200 for it."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is well above my budget for this product. I know I can get the same product from John for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. I'm willing to offer $70 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to another seller. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","This is a tough spot. Bob's offer is far below what I need to make a profit. I'd rather sell to John.
