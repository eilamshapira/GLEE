"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking $200 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully.

The product is worth no more than $100 to me, but Alice is asking for $200. This is clearly not a good deal for me since it's double what the product is worth to me.

I know I can always buy from John for $100, which matches the maximum value of the product to me. However, I should try to negotiate with Alice first to see if I can get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is well above my budget for this product. I know I can get the same product from John for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. I'm willing to offer $70 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to another seller. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 70}"
