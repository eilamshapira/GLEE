"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to carefully consider my options here. Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is exactly what it's worth to her. However, this price is above my maximum value of $800,000, so accepting would mean I'm paying more than the product is worth to me.

I could reject and make a counteroffer, but I also have the option to buy from John for $800,000 at any time. Since $800,000 is my maximum value for the product, buying from John would be a neutral outcome (I'd pay exactly what it's worth to me).

I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price than John's $800,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low that it would be considered unreasonable.

{""product_price"": $650,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this price is still above my maximum value of $800,000, and also higher than John's fixed offer of $800,000.

Since I can buy from John at $800,000 (which is exactly my maximum value), and Alice's current offer exceeds that, I'll reject Alice's offer and try one more counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal than John's.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by dropping her price. I'll make a more reasonable counteroffer that's below John's price of $800,000 but higher than my previous offer, showing I'm also willing to move toward a middle ground.

{""product_price"": $750,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice is continuing to lower her price, now to $950,000, but this is still above both my maximum value and John's offer of $800,000. 

Since Alice's price is still higher than what I can get from John, and we've gone through several rounds already, I'll choose to buy from John at $800,000. This ensures I get the product at my maximum acceptable price without risking further unsuccessful negotiations.
