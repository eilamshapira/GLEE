Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, there's no reason to accept an offer that's less than half of that amount. While I could make a counteroffer, if Bob's initial offer is this low, it might be more efficient to take the guaranteed sale.
