"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe that price is too high, especially considering I can get the same product from John for $1200000. To make it worthwhile for me to buy from you instead of John, I would need a better price. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. This would give you a quick sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate you making an offer. While I can't match the theoretical price from John (as he's not actually selling!), I'm willing to be more flexible. How about we meet in the middle? I'll offer it to you for $1100000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to see you benefit from this product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
