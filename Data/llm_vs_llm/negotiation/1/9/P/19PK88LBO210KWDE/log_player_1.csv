Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe that price is too high, especially considering I can get the same product from John for $1200000. To make it worthwhile for me to buy from you instead of John, I would need a better price. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. This would give you a quick sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate you making an offer. While I can't match the theoretical price from John (as he's not actually selling!), I'm willing to be more flexible. How about we meet in the middle? I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to see you benefit from this product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
