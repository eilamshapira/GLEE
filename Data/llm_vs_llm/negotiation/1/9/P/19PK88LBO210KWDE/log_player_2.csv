Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate you making an offer. While I can't match the theoretical price from John (as he's not actually selling!), I'm willing to be more flexible. How about we meet in the middle? I'll offer it to you for $1100000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to see you benefit from this product.
