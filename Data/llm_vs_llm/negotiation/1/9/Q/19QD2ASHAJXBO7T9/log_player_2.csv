"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to consider my options based on the information provided:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $200
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $100

Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $100, Alice's offer of $200 is not a good deal. I would be paying $100 more than the product's value to me and $100 more than my alternative option.
