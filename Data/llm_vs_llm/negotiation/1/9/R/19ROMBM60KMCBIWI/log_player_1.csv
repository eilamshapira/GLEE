Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it will be a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I was hoping to find a better price. Would you consider selling the product for $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Okay, I need to decide. Selling to John for $8,000 is the guaranteed minimum, but Bob values the product at $12,000. $9,000 is better than $8,000, but I'm aiming for more.

I'm going to **Reject Bob's offer** and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate the offer, I need to get closer to my target price. How about $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I was hoping for an even lower price. Would you consider selling the product for $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Okay, let's analyze this. $9,500 is still better than selling to John for $8,000. But I'm trying to get as much value as possible, and I know Bob values the product at $12,000. I also realize that I'm getting closer to Bob's desired price.

I will **Reject Bob's offer** and try to negotiate a bit more.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:
