Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer decreased by $100,000 from $1,700,000 to $1,600,000, I'll try to meet her halfway and increase my offer by $100,000 from $1,200,000 to $1,300,000, and then add a bit more to show that I'm willing to negotiate.

Since I can buy the product from John for $1,500,000, which is less than Alice's offer, I'll consider buying from John. However, I'll try to negotiate with Alice one more time to see if she can meet my target price.

My new counteroffer will be $1,500,000, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay.
