"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","The offer from Alice is $200, which is more than the $100 the product is worth to me. Since John is willing to sell the product for $100, which equals the maximum value I place on the product, there's no reason to accept Alice's much higher offer or even continue negotiating with her.
