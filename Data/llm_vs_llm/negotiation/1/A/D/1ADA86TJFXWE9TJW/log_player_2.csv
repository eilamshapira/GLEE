"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer is $180, which is higher than the $150 that the product is worth to me, and higher than John's price of $150, I should not accept it.

I have two remaining options: reject and make a counteroffer to Alice, or buy from John for $150. Since John is offering the product at exactly the maximum value I'm willing to pay ($150), I should just buy from John rather than spending time negotiating with Alice who started with a price above my valuation.
