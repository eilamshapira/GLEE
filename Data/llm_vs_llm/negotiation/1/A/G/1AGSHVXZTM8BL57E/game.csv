"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional quality and the value it can bring to you, I'm confident that it's worth $20000.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $20000 is well above my budget. I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $12000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I can offer you $10000 for the product. This would save me some money compared to John's offer and hopefully provide you with a fair profit as well.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, considering your budget and my bottom line, I'm willing to lower my previous offer to $16000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both parties. Remember that you mentioned you'd prefer to do business with me, and I'm confident that the value you'll get from this product is well worth the investment. What do you say to this new offer?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16000 is still more than I can justify spending, especially when John is offering the same product for $12000. To be completely transparent, I value this product at no more than $12000, which is why John's offer is my fallback option. But I'd still prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer $11000, which would save me money compared to John's price while giving you a sale that you might otherwise lose. Does that work for you?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, considering your budget and my bottom line, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $14000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both parties. Remember that you mentioned you'd prefer to do business with me, and I'm confident that the value you'll get from this product is well worth the investment. What do you say to this new offer?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate you coming down to $14000, Alice. That shows good faith in our negotiation. However, I need to be straightforward - I can purchase this product from John for $12000, which is actually the maximum value I place on this product for my needs. At this point, the only reason I would buy from you instead of John is if you can match or beat his price. To continue our business relationship, I can offer $11500, which is very close to John's price but would give you the sale rather than losing it to a competitor. Can we make this work?",11500.0,Bob,6,
