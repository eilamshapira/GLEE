Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $20000 is well above my budget. I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $12000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I can offer you $10000 for the product. This would save me some money compared to John's offer and hopefully provide you with a fair profit as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your openness about your budget and the other offer you have. However, $10,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and lower my initial price to $17,000. This way, you'll still save money compared to John's offer, and we can both walk away from the deal happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, considering your budget and my bottom line, I'm willing to lower my previous offer to $16,000.

What do you say to this new offer?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16000 is still more than I can justify spending, especially when John is offering the same product for $12000. To be completely transparent, I value this product at no more than $12000, which is why John's offer is my fallback option. But I'd still prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer $11000, which would save me money compared to John's price while giving you a sale that you might otherwise lose. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position better now, and I appreciate your transparency about your valuation of the product. Since you mentioned that you'd prefer to do business with me, I'm willing to make another concession and meet you halfway between your last offer and John's price. I can offer you the product for $13,500. This way, you'll still get a better deal than John's offer, and we can both walk away from this negotiation feeling satisfied. What do you think about this compromise?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, considering your budget and my bottom line, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $14,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down to $14000, Alice. That shows good faith in our negotiation. However, I need to be straightforward - I can purchase this product from John for $12000, which is actually the maximum value I place on this product for my needs. At this point, the only reason I would buy from you instead of John is if you can match or beat his price. To continue our business relationship, I can offer $11500, which is very close to John's price but would give you the sale rather than losing it to a competitor. Can we make this work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""message"":""Hi Bob, I appreciate your candidness about the value you place on the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, after careful consideration, I've decided that selling the product to you at $11,500 would not be in my best interest, as it's significantly lower than the value I place on it. Therefore, I've chosen to sell the product to another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase it for $15,000. I hope you understand my position and that we can collaborate again in the future under different circumstances. Thank you for your time and for the open negotiation.""}"
