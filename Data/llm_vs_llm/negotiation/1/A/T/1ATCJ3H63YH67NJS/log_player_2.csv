"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me think about this strategically:

1. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
2. Alice's offer is $10,000, which is $2,000 less than John's price
3. Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation
4. By rejecting and making a counteroffer, I might be able to get an even better price

$10,000 is already a better deal than John's price, but since I know Alice's cost is $8,000, I should try to negotiate for a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice and they offered $10,000, I'll make a counteroffer that still gives Alice a reasonable profit but saves me more money. I'll propose a price halfway between Alice's cost and their initial offer.

{""product_price"": 9000}

This offer would give Alice a $1,000 profit while saving me $3,000 compared to John's price. It's a reasonable counteroffer that leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has moved down from their initial $10,000 to $9,500
2. This is a $500 reduction from their first offer
3. The price is still well below John's $12,000
4. Alice moved halfway between their initial offer ($10,000) and my counteroffer ($9,000)
5. While we might negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might not go much lower since they need to make a profit above their $8,000 cost

$9,500 represents a good compromise - it gives Alice a reasonable profit ($1,500) while saving me $2,500 compared to John's price. Further negotiation might only yield minimal savings and risks prolonging the deal unnecessarily.
