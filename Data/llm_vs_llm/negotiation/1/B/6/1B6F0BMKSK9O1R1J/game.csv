"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $6000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",6000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $6000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $13500, which is still a great deal for a product of this caliber. Please let me know if this works for you.",13500.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I need to ensure we meet our minimum value. I can offer the product at $13000, which is a significant reduction from our initial offer and still represents excellent value for you. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price, but $13000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I can offer $9500 for the product. If this isn't acceptable, I may need to consider other options.",9500.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $9500 is still below our minimum threshold. I can go as low as $12500, which is very close to our bottom line and represents a fair compromise. Please let me know if you can accept this offer.",12500.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. I can lower the price to $12250, which is the lowest I can go while still meeting our needs. This is a final offer from my side. Let me know if you can accept this price.",12250.0,Alice,5,
