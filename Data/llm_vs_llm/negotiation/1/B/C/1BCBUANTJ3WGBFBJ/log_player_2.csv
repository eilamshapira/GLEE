"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's initial offer is already at the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($1,000,000), and I have the option to buy the product from John for the same price, I don't see any benefit in accepting Alice's offer without trying to negotiate a better price.

My decision is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Alice a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I don't know the value of the product to Alice, I'll start with a relatively low price and see how she responds.

My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": $500,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $900,000 is still relatively high, but it's a significant decrease from her initial offer of $1,000,000. Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'd like to see if I can negotiate an even better price.

I'll reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where I'll send a new counteroffer. My goal is to meet somewhere in the middle between my previous offer of $500,000 and Alice's new offer of $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $900,000, and my previous offer was $500,000, I'll try to split the difference and make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than the midpoint.

My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": $700,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $850,000 is still higher than my last counteroffer of $700,000, but it's getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with. Since I've already invested time in negotiating with Alice, I'd like to try to get an even better deal.

However, I also need to consider that I have a limited number of rounds left (5 rounds remaining), and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy the product at a reasonable price.

I'll reject Alice's offer again, but I'll make a more modest counteroffer to see if I can get closer to a mutually acceptable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $850,000, and my previous offer was $700,000, I'll try to make a more modest increase to see if I can get closer to a mutually acceptable price.

My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": $775,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like, but it's getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with. Considering that I've already negotiated for 6 rounds, and I have only 3 rounds left, I need to weigh the benefits of continuing to negotiate against the risk of losing the deal.

At this point, I'm starting to think that Alice's offers are getting closer to her walk-away price, and I may not be able to get a significantly better deal. Since $825,000 is still $175,000 less than what I could buy the product from John for, I'm inclined to accept Alice's offer.
