"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000, considering my budget and the potential return on investment. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand budget is a consideration. To show I'm serious about working with you, I'm willing to come down a bit more. Let's try $13000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a very fair price for the value you'll receive.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the reduction to $13000, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. Considering my initial offer of $10000 and your willingness to negotiate, I'd like to propose a compromise at $11500. This price feels more reasonable to me, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm very close to my bottom line here. This product is worth it, and I truly believe it will benefit you. To try and close this deal, I'll come down to $12000. That's the lowest I can go.",12000.0,Alice,5,
