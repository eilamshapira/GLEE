Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000, considering my budget and the potential return on investment. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the reduction to $13000, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. Considering my initial offer of $10000 and your willingness to negotiate, I'd like to propose a compromise at $11500. This price feels more reasonable to me, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.
