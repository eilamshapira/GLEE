Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1,400,000}

I'm offering a price of $1.4 million, which is slightly below what the product is worth to Bob ($1.5M) but significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($1M). This leaves some room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $1.2M. While it's better than John's $1M, there's still room for negotiation since I know the product is worth $1.5M to Bob. I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price point between $1.2M and $1.4M to find a middle ground that's more profitable for me while still being attractive to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1,300,000}

I'm offering $1.3M, which is a middle ground between Bob's previous offer of $1.2M and my initial offer of $1.4M. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and compromise, while still maintaining a good profit margin. The price is still well below what the product is worth to Bob ($1.5M), making it an attractive deal for him, while being significantly better than my fallback option with John ($1M)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1.25M. This is a reasonable compromise that gives me a good profit margin ($250K above my minimum price of $1M). While it's possible to continue negotiating, there's a risk that prolonged negotiations might lead Bob to walk away, leaving me with only John's $1M offer. The current offer represents a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful deal completion."
