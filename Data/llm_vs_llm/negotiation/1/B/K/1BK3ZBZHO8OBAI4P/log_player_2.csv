"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than my maximum budget of $1,500,000, I am willing to consider it. However, I also know that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, which suggests there may be room for negotiation to get a better price.

Given that I have the option to buy from John for $1,500,000, which is my maximum budget, and Alice's initial offer is $1,400,000, I believe I can try to negotiate a better price with Alice.

Therefore, my decision is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer, hoping to get a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 and knowing the product's value to her is $1,000,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer that is reasonable and potentially acceptable to both parties.

My counteroffer is to buy the product for $1,200,000. This price is still above the product's value to Alice, ensuring she makes a profit, but it's also significantly lower than her initial offer, which could save me a substantial amount of money.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has made a new offer of $1,300,000 after rejecting my counteroffer of $1,200,000. This indicates that she is willing to negotiate and lower her price, but she still wants to make a significant profit from the sale.

Given that my goal is to save as much money as possible while still acquiring the product, and knowing that Alice's bottom line is $1,000,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation.

Alice's new offer of $1,300,000 is closer to my target, but it's still $100,000 more than my previous counteroffer. Since I have the option to buy from John for $1,500,000, which is my maximum budget, and Alice's offer is below this threshold, I'm inclined to continue negotiating.

However, I also need to consider that prolonged negotiations might not yield a significantly better price, and Alice might not be willing to go much lower.

In this round, I decide to reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer, trying to meet somewhere in the middle or slightly closer to my previous offer.

My new counteroffer would be $1,250,000. This price is still above Alice's bottom line, ensuring she makes a profit, and it's a compromise between her latest offer and my previous counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my counteroffer is $1,250,000."
