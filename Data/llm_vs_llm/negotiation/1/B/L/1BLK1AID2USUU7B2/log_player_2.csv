Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1000000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1250000. This still gives you a significant opportunity, and it's a fair price considering the value of this product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1150000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still a bit short of what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. This is a fair price that respects your budget and allows me to secure a reasonable return on this unique product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
