"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling the product to me. However, I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $800000. Your asking price of $1200000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'd like to counteroffer $650000 for the product. This would give me a reason to choose your product over John's offer.",650000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your position, the price you've proposed is below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1000000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my interest in doing business with you.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given our previous discussions, I'm prepared to lower my price further to $900000. This offer demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts on this?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate you working with me to find a price that works for both of us. However, $900000 is still more than I can justify paying, especially when John is offering the same product for $800000. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer you $750000, which would be a fair deal for both of us and give me some savings compared to John's offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your need to compare with John's offer. However, I need to maintain a certain value for the product. I'm willing to come down to $850000, which is a significant concession on my part. This price is still competitive and reflects the quality and value of the product. What do you say?",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're getting closer to finding a middle ground. To show my commitment to closing this deal with you, I'm willing to lower the price to $825000. This is very close to John's offer but still allows me to maintain the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for continuing to work with me on the price. I appreciate that you've come down to $825000, which is much closer to a workable solution. However, I need to be frank - I cannot justify paying more than $800000 for this product, as that's the maximum value it holds for me. John is already offering it at exactly $800000. For me to choose you over John, I would need you to match or beat his price. I can offer you $785000, which would give me a small advantage over John's offer while still providing you with a reasonable deal.",785000.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I understand your position and the value you place on the product. Given that, I'm willing to meet you at $800000, which matches John's offer. This way, you get the product at the price you're comfortable with, and I can still maintain the minimum value I need. Does this work for you?",,Alice,6,RejectOffer
