Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling the product to me. However, I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $800000. Your asking price of $1200000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'd like to counteroffer $650000 for the product. This would give me a reason to choose your product over John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I understand your position, the price you've proposed is below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,000,000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my interest in doing business with you.""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given our previous discussions, I'm prepared to lower my price further to $900,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate you working with me to find a price that works for both of us. However, $900000 is still more than I can justify paying, especially when John is offering the same product for $800000. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer you $750000, which would be a fair deal for both of us and give me some savings compared to John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your need to compare with John's offer. However, I need to maintain a certain value for the product. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant concession on my part. This price is still competitive and reflects the quality and value of the product. What do you say?""}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see that we're getting closer to finding a middle ground. To show my commitment to closing this deal with you, I'm willing to lower the price to $825,000. This is very close to John's offer but still allows me to maintain the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 825000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for continuing to work with me on the price. I appreciate that you've come down to $825000, which is much closer to a workable solution. However, I need to be frank - I cannot justify paying more than $800000 for this product, as that's the maximum value it holds for me. John is already offering it at exactly $800000. For me to choose you over John, I would need you to match or beat his price. I can offer you $785000, which would give me a small advantage over John's offer while still providing you with a reasonable deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000
