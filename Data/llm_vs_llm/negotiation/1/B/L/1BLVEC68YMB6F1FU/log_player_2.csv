"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I notice that Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which exceeds the $800,000 maximum value to me. Given that John is offering the same product for $800,000, which matches my maximum valuation, Alice's current offer is not competitive.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling the product to me. However, I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $800,000. Your asking price of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'd like to counteroffer $650,000 for the product. This would give me a reason to choose your product over John's offer."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given our previous discussions, I'm prepared to lower my price further to $900000. This offer demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts on this? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has dropped her price significantly to $900,000, which is moving in the right direction. However, this is still $100,000 more than John's offer of $800,000. Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and John is offering exactly that price, it doesn't make financial sense to accept Alice's current offer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate you working with me to find a price that works for both of us. However, $900,000 is still more than I can justify paying, especially when John is offering the same product for $800,000. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer you $750,000, which would be a fair deal for both of us and give me some savings compared to John's offer."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see that we're getting closer to finding a middle ground. To show my commitment to closing this deal with you, I'm willing to lower the price to $825000. This is very close to John's offer but still allows me to maintain the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her price to $825,000, which is getting closer to John's offer of $800,000. However, since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and John is offering exactly that price, it still doesn't make financial sense to pay $25,000 extra for the same product.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for continuing to work with me on the price. I appreciate that you've come down to $825,000, which is much closer to a workable solution. However, I need to be frank - I cannot justify paying more than $800,000 for this product, as that's the maximum value it holds for me. John is already offering it at exactly $800,000. For me to choose you over John, I would need you to match or beat his price. I can offer you $785,000, which would give me a small advantage over John's offer while still providing you with a reasonable deal."", ""product_price"": 785000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and the value you place on the product. Given that, I'm willing to meet you at $800000, which matches John's offer. This way, you get the product at the price you're comfortable with, and I can still maintain the minimum value I need. Does this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has now offered the product at $800,000, which matches exactly what John is offering and is the maximum value the product has to me. At this point, there's no financial advantage to continuing negotiation or switching to John, as both options result in the same price.
