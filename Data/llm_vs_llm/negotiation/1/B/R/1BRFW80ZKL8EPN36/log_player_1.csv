"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm starting with my desired price, as it's the minimum I'm willing to accept. This gives Bob a clear understanding of my expectations and allows for room to negotiate."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's significantly below my minimum value.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

```

I'm counteroffering with $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility, but still a price that's closer to my desired value. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low, but it's getting closer.  I'm not willing to accept it yet, but I'm hoping to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not quite there. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm running out of time. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm also considering selling to John if we don't reach an agreement soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,000,000. This is my final compromise, as it's exactly what the product is worth to Bob.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement this round."
