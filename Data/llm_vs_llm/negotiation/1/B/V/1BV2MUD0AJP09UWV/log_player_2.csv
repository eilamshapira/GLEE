"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I hope you're well. I'd like to offer you an opportunity to purchase my product. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This represents an excellent investment opportunity with significant potential returns. I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $1,500,000, which is significantly above my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $800,000

Alice's offer is clearly too high and would result in a significant loss for me. Even if I were to make a counteroffer, it's unlikely that Alice would accept a price below $1,200,000 (the product's worth to her). Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value ($800,000), it makes the most sense to buy from him rather than continue negotiating with Alice.
