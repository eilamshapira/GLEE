Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll provide a well-considered offer to Bob.

Looking at the situation:
- The product is worth at least $150 to me (Alice)
- The product is worth $80 to Bob
- If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150

Since Bob values the product at $80, he won't accept any offer above that amount. And since I have a guaranteed $150 from John if Bob rejects my offer, there's no reason for me to offer the product to Bob for less than $150.
