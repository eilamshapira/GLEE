"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is beyond my budget. I'd like to counter with $75. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a better price. Let me offer you $130, which is the lowest I'm comfortable with at this point.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $90 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get a better price. Let me offer you $120, and I'll also throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the new offer. I appreciate the bonus, but $120 is still above what I'm looking to spend. Could we settle at $95? I think this is a reasonable compromise considering my budget constraints.",95.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you closer to your price point. Let me offer you $105, which is the lowest I'm comfortable with considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I really appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, $105 is just slightly above my limit. How about we finalize at $100? This way, we both get a deal we're comfortable with.",100.0,Bob,8,
