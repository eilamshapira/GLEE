Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

However, considering Bob's offer is close to John's offer of $100, I will make a more modest counteroffer.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you closer to your price point. Let me offer you $105, which is the lowest I'm comfortable with considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I really appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, $105 is just slightly above my limit. How about we finalize at $100? This way, we both get a deal we're comfortable with.

Since Bob's offer is now equal to John's offer, there's no benefit in selling to John instead. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at the same price, and it concludes the negotiation process."
