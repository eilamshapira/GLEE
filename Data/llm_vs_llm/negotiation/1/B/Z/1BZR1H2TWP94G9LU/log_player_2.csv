"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $100
2. The product is worth $100 to me
3. John's price is also $100

Since all prices are the same ($100), and I need the product, I can accept Alice's offer as it makes no difference financially. There's no advantage in rejecting Alice's offer or buying from John since the price is identical.
