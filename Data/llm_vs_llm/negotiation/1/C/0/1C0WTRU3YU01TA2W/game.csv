"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're offering, $1400000 is quite steep and close to what I could pay elsewhere. Given that this product has a market value closer to $1000000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. This would still provide you with a healthy profit while giving me the value I'm looking for. I'm open to finding a middle ground that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. While I understand your perspective, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for us. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider a price of $1150000? This way, we both gain a fair profit.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can find common ground. However, $1150000 is still higher than what I was hoping to pay. I can move up from my initial offer to $975000. This represents a fair value considering the market conditions and would still provide you with a substantial profit margin. I'm committed to making this deal work if we can find a price that's reasonable for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
