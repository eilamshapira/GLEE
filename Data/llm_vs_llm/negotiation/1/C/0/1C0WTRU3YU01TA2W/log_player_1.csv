Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're offering, $1400000 is quite steep and close to what I could pay elsewhere. Given that this product has a market value closer to $1000000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. This would still provide you with a healthy profit while giving me the value I'm looking for. I'm open to finding a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can find common ground. However, $1150000 is still higher than what I was hoping to pay. I can move up from my initial offer to $975000. This represents a fair value considering the market conditions and would still provide you with a substantial profit margin. I'm committed to making this deal work if we can find a price that's reasonable for both of us.
