(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, I need to decide. My options are:

*   Accept $100 from Bob.
*   Reject Bob and counteroffer.
*   Sell to John for $80.

Given that the product is worth at least $80 to me, and I have a good chance to get a higher price from Bob, I'll try to negotiate.

$110 is better than $80, but I still think I can get a better deal from Bob.

$95 is better than $80, and we're getting later in the rounds. It is not worth risking to get a lower price.
