"Bob, I'm excited you're interested in acquiring this unique asset. Its potential is truly limitless. To start, I'm offering it to you for $1500000. I believe this reflects its inherent value and the significant return it can generate.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to be transparent that its value to me is significantly lower than your asking price. Based on my assessment and budget constraints, I can offer $500000 for the product. This represents the realistic value it would bring to my business. I know this is a substantial reduction from your initial offer, but I hope we can find middle ground that works for both of us.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $500000 is far below the minimum I can accept. While I appreciate your interest, the absolute lowest I can consider at this stage is $1300000. This reflects a small concession on my part, but I truly believe this is a valuable asset with significant potential for the right buyer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for coming down in your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be candid that I have an alternative option to purchase this same product from another seller for $800000. For me to consider purchasing from you instead, I would need a more competitive offer. I can increase my bid to $650000, which I believe is fair given the market conditions. I hope we can find a price point that works for both of us, as I would prefer to do business with you if possible.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have another option. However, I am confident that the quality and unique features of this product justify a higher price. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. My counteroffer is $1150000. This is a significant reduction from my initial asking price, and I believe it represents a very fair valuation. Consider the long-term value and the potential for growth.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation and the reductions you've made from your initial price. I understand you believe your product offers unique value, and I respect that. However, I must be transparent that I have a firm budget constraint and an alternative offer of $800000 for an equivalent product. This alternative represents the maximum I'm willing to pay. To demonstrate my genuine interest in working with you specifically, I'm willing to offer $750000 - very close to my maximum budget. This is my best and final offer, as anything higher would not make financial sense for me. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price point.",750000.0,Bob,6,
