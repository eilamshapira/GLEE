Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to be transparent that its value to me is significantly lower than your asking price. Based on my assessment and budget constraints, I can offer $500000 for the product. This represents the realistic value it would bring to my business. I know this is a substantial reduction from your initial offer, but I hope we can find middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for coming down in your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be candid that I have an alternative option to purchase this same product from another seller for $800000. For me to consider purchasing from you instead, I would need a more competitive offer. I can increase my bid to $650000, which I believe is fair given the market conditions. I hope we can find a price point that works for both of us, as I would prefer to do business with you if possible.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have another option. However, I am confident that the quality and unique features of this product justify a higher price. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. My counteroffer is $1,150,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial asking price, and I believe it represents a very fair valuation. Consider the long-term value and the potential for growth."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation and the reductions you've made from your initial price. I understand you believe your product offers unique value, and I respect that. However, I must be transparent that I have a firm budget constraint and an alternative offer of $800000 for an equivalent product. This alternative represents the maximum I'm willing to pay. To demonstrate my genuine interest in working with you specifically, I'm willing to offer $750000 - very close to my maximum budget. This is my best and final offer, as anything higher would not make financial sense for me. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price point.
