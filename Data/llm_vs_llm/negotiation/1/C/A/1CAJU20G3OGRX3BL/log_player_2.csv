"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited you're interested in acquiring this unique asset. Its potential is truly limitless. To start, I'm offering it to you for $1500000. I believe this reflects its inherent value and the significant return it can generate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering to sell the product for $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than both your maximum valuation ($800,000) and the alternative option of buying from John for $800,000.

Since the product is only worth up to $800,000 to you, paying $1,500,000 would be a bad deal. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to be transparent that its value to me is significantly lower than your asking price. Based on my assessment and budget constraints, I can offer $500,000 for the product. This represents the realistic value it would bring to my business. I know this is a substantial reduction from your initial offer, but I hope we can find middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $500000 is far below the minimum I can accept. While I appreciate your interest, the absolute lowest I can consider at this stage is $1300000. This reflects a small concession on my part, but I truly believe this is a valuable asset with significant potential for the right buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her price from $1,500,000 to $1,300,000, which shows some flexibility. However, this is still significantly above my maximum value of $800,000, and I can get the same product from John for exactly $800,000.

Since Alice's current offer would result in me paying $500,000 more than the product is worth to me, and $500,000 more than John's price, I should reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for coming down in your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be candid that I have an alternative option to purchase this same product from another seller for $800,000. For me to consider purchasing from you instead, I would need a more competitive offer. I can increase my bid to $650,000, which I believe is fair given the market conditions. I hope we can find a price point that works for both of us, as I would prefer to do business with you if possible."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have another option. However, I am confident that the quality and unique features of this product justify a higher price. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. My counteroffer is $1150000. This is a significant reduction from my initial asking price, and I believe it represents a very fair valuation. Consider the long-term value and the potential for growth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her price further to $1,150,000, showing continued flexibility. However, this price is still $350,000 above John's offer of $800,000, and it's still above my maximum valuation of $800,000.

Since we've gone through multiple rounds of negotiation, and Alice's price remains significantly higher than both my maximum value and my alternative option, it makes sense to reject this offer again and make one final reasonable counteroffer before potentially turning to John.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation and the reductions you've made from your initial price. I understand you believe your product offers unique value, and I respect that. However, I must be transparent that I have a firm budget constraint and an alternative offer of $800,000 for an equivalent product. This alternative represents the maximum I'm willing to pay. To demonstrate my genuine interest in working with you specifically, I'm willing to offer $750,000 - very close to my maximum budget. This is my best and final offer, as anything higher would not make financial sense for me. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price point."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
