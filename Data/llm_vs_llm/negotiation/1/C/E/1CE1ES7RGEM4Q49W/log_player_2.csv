"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I should reject this offer because $120 is too high - it's above both my maximum valuation ($80) and even above Alice's valuation ($100). I can either negotiate with Alice for a better price or buy from John for $80.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $100 to Alice and $80 to me, I'll start with a reasonably low offer that gives room for negotiation but isn't insultingly low.

{""product_price"": 70}

This offer is below both my maximum ($80) and Alice's cost ($100), giving room for negotiation while still potentially allowing both of us to benefit if we meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer ($100) is still higher than both John's price ($80) and my maximum valuation ($80), I should not accept this offer. While Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, it's still more rational for me to buy from John at $80 than accept this price.
