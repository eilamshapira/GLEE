Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. Since the product is worth $120 to Bob and $100 to me, there's a $20 surplus that can be split. I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while still being below Bob's maximum value.

{""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:
1. Bob offered $105, which is $5 above my minimum value ($100)
2. Bob's maximum value is $120, so there's still room for negotiation
3. I risk losing $5 if I reject and end up selling to John ($100)
4. However, since Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, I believe I can get a better price

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob came up from his initial rejection to $105, I'll reduce my asking price a bit from my initial $115, but still try to capture more of the surplus than $105 would give me.
