"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","$130 is a decent offer, significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $100 and better than John's guaranteed offer. While I might be able to negotiate for a bit more, there's also a risk of Bob walking away or making lower counteroffers. I'll accept this offer.
