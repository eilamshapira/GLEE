"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $150 is way too high since the product is only worth $80 to me. It's better to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. If we can't reach an agreement, I can always buy from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 60}

I'll start with a lower offer of $60. Since the product is worth $150 to Alice and $80 to me, there's room for negotiation. Starting low gives me room to increase my offer if needed, while still potentially getting a better deal than John's $80 price."
