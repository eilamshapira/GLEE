"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Considering my minimum value for the product is $1,500,000, Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is too low. I should reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a tough one. Bob is getting closer to my minimum value. However, I can get $1,500,000 from John right now. I'd prefer to get more, but I also don't want to risk losing the sale altogether. Let me evaluate the options.

*   **Accept Bob's offer:** $1,400,000 - Less than what I want.
*   **Reject and Counteroffer:** This is risky. Bob might walk away, and I'd lose the deal altogether.
*   **Sell to John:** $1,500,000 - Guaranteed, meets my minimum.

Given the risk, I'm going to play it safe and sell to John.
