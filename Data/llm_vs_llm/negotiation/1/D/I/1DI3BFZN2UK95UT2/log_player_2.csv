"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, though I understand the value proposition is subjective. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $1,200,000, which is above my maximum budget, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,000,000.
