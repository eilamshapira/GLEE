Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer Bob that maximizes my earnings, considering that I can always sell to John for $8,000 if Bob declines.

Since I don't know how much the product is worth to Bob, I need to balance between setting a high price (to maximize my profit if Bob accepts) and the risk of Bob rejecting the offer (in which case I get $8,000 from John).

Given that my fallback option is already secured at $8,000, I should offer Bob a price significantly higher than this amount to make the potential deal worthwhile.
