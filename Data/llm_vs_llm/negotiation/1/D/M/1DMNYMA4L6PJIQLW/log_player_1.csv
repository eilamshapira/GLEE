"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $150, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer and the quality of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I'm willing to purchase the product at $100. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I believe I can get a better deal from Bob or sell it to John for $120 if negotiations don't improve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that budget can be a constraint, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140 for this product, considering its quality and value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my target price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 140}"
