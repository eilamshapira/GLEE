"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but $2000000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay a significant amount, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market and my own financial constraints.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations. However, the value of this product is substantial, and I can't go down to $1000000. Given the product's unique qualities and potential, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1700000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet in the middle. However, $1700000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I need to balance my budget. Considering the product's value and my own limitations, I'd like to propose $1200000. This is the highest I'm comfortable going, and I believe it's a reasonable price for both parties.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
