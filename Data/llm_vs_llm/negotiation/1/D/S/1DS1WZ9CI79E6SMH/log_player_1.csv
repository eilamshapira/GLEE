Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive product. Considering its unique value and the substantial investment required, I'm willing to let it go for $2,000,000. This is a truly exceptional opportunity."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but $2000000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay a significant amount, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market and my own financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Okay, considering Bob's counteroffer of $1,000,000 and the potential to sell to John for $1,200,000, I have a decision to make.

Rejecting Bob's offer and countering gives me a chance for a higher profit, but there's always the risk he'll walk away or offer even less. Accepting now means a loss. Selling to John guarantees $1,200,000.

Given the situation, I'll **reject** Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations. However, the value of this product is substantial, and I can't go down to $1,000,000. Given the product's unique qualities and potential, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,700,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet in the middle. However, $1700000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I need to balance my budget. Considering the product's value and my own limitations, I'd like to propose $1200000. This is the highest I'm comfortable going, and I believe it's a reasonable price for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Okay, Bob is now offering $1,200,000. This is the same amount I can get from John.

Since my goal is to earn as much as I can, and I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, I will take this opportunity to sell the product to John.
