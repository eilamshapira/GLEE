Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations. However, the value of this product is substantial, and I can't go down to $1000000. Given the product's unique qualities and potential, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1700000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.
