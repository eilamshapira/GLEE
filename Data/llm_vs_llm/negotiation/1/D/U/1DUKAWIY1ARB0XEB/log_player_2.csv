"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let's analyze the situation:

*   **Alice's offer:** $1,450,000
*   **My value:** $1,500,000
*   **Alice's value:** $1,000,000
*   **John's offer:** $1,500,000

I want to spend as little money as possible. Alice's offer is already better than John's offer. I can either accept Alice's offer now or risk potentially getting a better price later. However, there are only 10 rounds. Considering that the difference between the value of the product to me and Alice's offer is relatively small, it is better to secure the deal by accepting the offer.

Therefore, I choose to accept Alice's offer.
