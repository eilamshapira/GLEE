"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to make a decision based on the given information. 

Alice is offering the product for $150, but the product is worth no more than $120 to me. John is offering the same product for $120, which matches the maximum value I place on it.

Since Alice's price ($150) exceeds the value I place on the product ($120) and is higher than John's price ($120), the rational choice is to buy from John.
