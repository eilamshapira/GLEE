"Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given the situation:

*   **Alice's offer:** $119
*   **Your value:** $120 (maximum you're willing to pay)
*   **John's price:** $120

Analyzing the options:

1.  **Accept Alice's offer:** You pay $119. This is less than your maximum value, and also less than what John offers.
2.  **Reject Alice's offer:** You risk Alice raising the price or potentially ending the negotiation. You also have the possibility to pay less than $119, or more.
3.  **Buy from John:** You pay $120. This is the maximum you're willing to pay.

Since Alice's offer is better than John's and within your budget, the best decision is to accept Alice's offer.
