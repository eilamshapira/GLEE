"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you the product for $100. Let me know if you’re interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering the product at $100
2. John is also selling it at $100
3. The product is worth $100 to me
4. Since Alice is actively negotiating, there might be room to get a better price from her

In this situation, it makes sense to reject Alice's initial offer and make a counteroffer. There's no downside to trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice, since I can always fall back to either accepting her original offer or buying from John at the same price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but not so low as to be offensive. Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, she might be willing to negotiate down to make the sale.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $100 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $75? This would allow me to make the purchase today."", ""product_price"": 75}"
