"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll analyze this offer:

- The product is worth at most $150 to me
- Alice's offer is $140
- My alternative is buying from John at $150
- The product costs Alice $80, so there's room for negotiation

Alice's current offer is already $10 better than John's price, but there's significant room to negotiate a better deal since Alice only values the product at $80.
