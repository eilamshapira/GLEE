"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I should analyze this situation carefully. Alice is offering the product for $14,500, while John's alternative price is $15,000.

The product is worth at most $15,000 to me, so both offers are within my acceptable range. However, I want to save as much money as possible.

Alice's offer is $500 less than John's price, which is a modest savings. However, since the product is only worth $12,000 to Alice, there's potential to negotiate an even better price from Alice.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This gives me a chance to get a better price while still having John's $15,000 offer as a fallback.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice that gives us both some room to negotiate while still providing value to both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has lowered her price to $14,000, which is $1,000 less than John's price. This is a better offer than her initial $14,500, showing she's willing to negotiate. However, there's still room for negotiation since the product is worth $12,000 to her.

The $14,000 offer already saves me $1,000 compared to buying from John, but I think I can still get a better deal from Alice while keeping negotiations positive.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, aiming to find a middle ground between my previous offer ($13,000) and her current offer ($14,000).

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that moves us closer to a middle ground, showing I'm willing to be reasonable while still trying to get a good deal.
