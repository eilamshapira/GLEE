"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at $120, which I think is a fair price considering its features and quality. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given that:
1. Alice is offering the product for $120
2. John is also selling it for $120
3. The product is worth no more than $120 to me

In this situation, all options would cost the same amount ($120). Since there's no price advantage between Alice and John's offers, and Alice has already engaged in communication and presented the offer, it makes sense to proceed with Alice's offer.
