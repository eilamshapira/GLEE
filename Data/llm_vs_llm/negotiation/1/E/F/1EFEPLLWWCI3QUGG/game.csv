"Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I'm offering you. Given its quality and market value, I'm pricing it at $20000. This is a competitive offer for a product of this caliber. Are you interested?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to buy the product for $7000. Let me know your thoughts.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $7000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. This product's value to me is no less than $12000, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. Given the quality and value of what I'm offering, I can come down to $17500. This is still a very competitive price considering what you're getting.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I understand the value you're talking about, but I have a strict budget. I can raise my offer to $8500. I hope we can find a common ground that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand budget constraints, but I need to be transparent - I have a firm floor of $12000 on this product, as that's what it's worth to me and what I can get elsewhere. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. My best offer is $15000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial price. This represents excellent value for the quality you're receiving.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget limitations, I can go up to $9500. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price, as I'd really like to work with you.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your increased offer. While $9500 is getting closer, I must emphasize that I cannot go below $12000 for this product. This is the absolute minimum I can accept, as I have a guaranteed buyer at this price point. If you can meet me at $13500, we can close this deal immediately. Otherwise, I would need at least $12000 to make this work.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate and come down on the price. I understand your position, but I have to stick to my budget strictly. The best I can do is $10000, which matches an alternative offer I have. I hope you can consider my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a tight budget and I appreciate your final offer of $10000. However, I need to be straightforward - I have a firm offer of $12000 from another buyer. This is my absolute minimum acceptable price, as anything less would be a financial loss for me. Given our negotiations and my desire to work with you, I'll make my final offer at $12000 - the same as my alternative option. I hope you can meet me at this price point.",12000.0,Alice,9,
