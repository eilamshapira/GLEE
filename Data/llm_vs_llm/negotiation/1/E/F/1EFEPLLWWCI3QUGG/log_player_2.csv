Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand budget constraints, but I need to be transparent - I have a firm floor of $12000 on this product, as that's what it's worth to me and what I can get elsewhere. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. My best offer is $15000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial price. This represents excellent value for the quality you're receiving.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your increased offer. While $9500 is getting closer, I must emphasize that I cannot go below $12000 for this product.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a tight budget and I appreciate your final offer of $10000. However, I need to be straightforward - I have a firm offer of $12000 from another buyer. This is my absolute minimum acceptable price, as anything less would be a financial loss for me.
