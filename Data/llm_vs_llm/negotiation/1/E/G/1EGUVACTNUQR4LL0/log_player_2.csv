"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $2,000,000, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower, but still shows that I'm interested in the product. I'll offer $500,000.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe it has value, but $2,000,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $500,000 for it. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget, I cannot accept $500000. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it for $1500000. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice is willing to lower the price to $1,500,000, it shows that she is willing to negotiate. However, $1,500,000 is still above my target price. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $1,500,000, I'll try to bring the price down further. I'll meet her halfway between my previous offer of $500,000 and her current offer of $1,500,000, which would be $1,000,000. However, since I know I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, I'll offer slightly less to see if Alice is willing to go lower.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,500,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 975000}"
