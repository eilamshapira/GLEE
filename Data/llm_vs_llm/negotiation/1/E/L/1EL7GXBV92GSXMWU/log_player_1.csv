"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate and also shows I believe in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I value the product at. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a significant profit margin. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now closer to my desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower profit is not worth it. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and minimizes further negotiation."
