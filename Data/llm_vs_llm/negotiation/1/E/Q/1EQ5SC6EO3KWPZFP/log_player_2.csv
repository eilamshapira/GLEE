"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you at a competitive price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that:
- The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
- John is offering to sell it for exactly $800,000
- Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my maximum valuation

Alice's current price is $400,000 more than what I value the product at, and exactly $400,000 more than John's offer. There's no reason to accept this offer or continue negotiating when it's so far above both my valuation and my alternative option.
