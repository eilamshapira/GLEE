"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell the product for $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we split the difference between your new offer and my previous counteroffer? I'd be willing to pay $11750. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",11750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob! Let's find a price that's fair for both of us. How about $12500 for the product? I believe this is a good compromise. Let me know your thoughts!",12500.0,Alice,5,
