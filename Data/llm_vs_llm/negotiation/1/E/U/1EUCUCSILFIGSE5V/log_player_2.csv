Round 2

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 10000}"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice was willing to come down from $15,000 to $13,500, I'll try to meet her halfway between her new offer and my previous counteroffer of $10,000.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob! Let's find a price that's fair for both of us. How about $12500 for the product? I believe this is a good compromise. Let me know your thoughts!
