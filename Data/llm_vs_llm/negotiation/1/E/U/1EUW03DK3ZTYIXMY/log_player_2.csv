"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given that the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and I want to save as much money as possible, Alice's offer of $115 is better than John's fixed price of $120. However, I can try to negotiate further with Alice since we have 10 rounds and her product is worth $100 to her, meaning there's room for negotiation.
