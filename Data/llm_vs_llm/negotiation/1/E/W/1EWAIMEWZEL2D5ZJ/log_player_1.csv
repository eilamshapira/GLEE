"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm delighted to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Considering its unique value and the strong interest it has generated, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $1400000 is far beyond my budget. I'm prepared to move quickly if we can agree on a price of $800000. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a tough spot. Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. However, I need to consider the potential for a better deal with Bob versus selling to John.

I'm going to **RejectOffer** and make a counteroffer. I believe there's room to negotiate upwards.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800,000 is not feasible, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. Considering the product's value, my rock-bottom price is $1,300,000. This is a significant discount for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
