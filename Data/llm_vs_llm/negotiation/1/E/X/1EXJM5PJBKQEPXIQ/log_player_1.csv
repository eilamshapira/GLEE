(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if we can find a better deal. I certainly will not leave the negotiation table so early. Next, I will try to find a compromise.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 120}

Let's see if Bob accepts this new offer. If he doesn't, I'll consider selling to John or negotiating further, but I believe this is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $105 is more than what John is willing to pay. It's better to sell to Bob at this price than to John for $100. I accept Bob's offer."
