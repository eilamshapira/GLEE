Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. Since the product is worth $120 to me and $100 to Bob, and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $120, I should start with a higher price to see if Bob might accept it, while knowing I can always fall back on John's offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum value of $120, and I have a guaranteed offer from John for $120, it wouldn't make sense to accept Bob's offer. Given that Bob's offer is quite low and he values the product at $100, there's little room for negotiation to reach a price above $120. The best decision is to sell to John.
