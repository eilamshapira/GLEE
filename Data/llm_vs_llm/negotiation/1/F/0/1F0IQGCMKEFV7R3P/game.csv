"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I need to let you know that $12000 is actually above my budget. I've actually received an offer from another seller for $10000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Given the market value, I'm prepared to offer $8500 for the product. This gives you a good profit while also giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to work with me. While I understand your budget constraints, I’m confident in the value of the product. How about we settle at $11000? This way, you’re getting excellent value compared to your alternative offer.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that. However, I need to be straightforward - I have a firm offer of $10000 from another seller. For me to choose you over them, I'd need a better price. I'm willing to pay $9200, which still gives you a good profit margin while giving me some incentive to choose you over my other option. Does that work for you?",9200.0,Bob,4,
