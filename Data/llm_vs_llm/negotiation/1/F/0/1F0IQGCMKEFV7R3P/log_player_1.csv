Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I need to let you know that $12000 is actually above my budget. I've actually received an offer from another seller for $10000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Given the market value, I'm prepared to offer $8500 for the product. This gives you a good profit while also giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that. However, I need to be straightforward - I have a firm offer of $10000 from another seller. For me to choose you over them, I'd need a better price. I'm willing to pay $9200, which still gives you a good profit margin while giving me some incentive to choose you over my other option. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
