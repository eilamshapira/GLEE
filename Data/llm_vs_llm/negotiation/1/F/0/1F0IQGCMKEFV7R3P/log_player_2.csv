"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! I believe you'll find it valuable. My offer is for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is actually more than the product is worth to me ($10,000) and even more than I can get it from John ($10,000). It doesn't make sense to accept this offer.

I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. John's price of $10,000 sets my maximum, so I should try to negotiate with Alice for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I need to let you know that $12,000 is actually above my budget. I've actually received an offer from another seller for $10,000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Given the market value, I'm prepared to offer $8,500 for the product. This gives you a good profit while also giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to work with me. While I understand your budget constraints, I’m confident in the value of the product. How about we settle at $11000? This way, you’re getting excellent value compared to your alternative offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has come down from $12,000 to $11,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still more than John's price of $10,000, so accepting this offer wouldn't make sense.

Since John is offering $10,000, and I know the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, I should either buy from John or try to get Alice to offer a better price.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that. However, I need to be straightforward - I have a firm offer of $10,000 from another seller. For me to choose you over them, I'd need a better price. I'm willing to pay $9,200, which still gives you a good profit margin while giving me some incentive to choose you over my other option. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 9200}"
