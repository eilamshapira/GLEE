{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. How about I offer it to you for $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}"

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, this is where it gets interesting. I need to think strategically. I know I *could* sell to John for $80 right now, which guarantees me that minimum profit. But, Bob might be willing to pay more.

Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
