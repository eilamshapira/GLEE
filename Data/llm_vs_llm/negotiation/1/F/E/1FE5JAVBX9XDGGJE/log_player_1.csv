Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll present an offer to Bob.

Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, which is exactly the same as my minimum acceptable value, there's no room for me to make additional profit by offering it to Bob at a higher price. Bob won't accept any price above $100, and I'm guaranteed to get $100 from John if Bob rejects my offer.

Therefore, I'll offer it to Bob at exactly $100, which gives him a neutral value proposition (neither gaining nor losing value) while maximizing my return.
