(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $115 is higher than my minimum price of $100 and lower than his perceived value of $150, I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll try to meet Bob halfway between my previous offer and his counteroffer. My previous offer was $140, and his counteroffer was $115, so I'll offer a price that's slightly lower than my previous offer.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer of $120 is getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since we're only in round 4 and I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, I'll reject his offer and try to get an even better price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll try to make a small concession to show that I'm willing to negotiate, while still aiming to get a good price. My previous offer was $130, and Bob's counteroffer was $120, so I'll offer a price that's slightly lower than my previous offer.
