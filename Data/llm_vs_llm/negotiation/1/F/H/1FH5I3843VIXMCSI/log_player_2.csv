"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll analyze this offer:

1. Alice is offering the product for $140
2. I know the product is worth $100 to Alice
3. My maximum value for the product is $150
4. John will definitely sell it to me for $150

Alice's current offer of $140 is better than John's price, but I think I can negotiate a better deal since Alice's cost is only $100. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but gives me a better deal:

{""product_price"": 115}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I see Alice has come down from $140 to $130, which shows she's willing to negotiate. My previous offer of $115 was rejected, but she's moving in my direction. Since we still have several rounds left and she's already reduced her price by $10, I'll continue negotiating to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $10 from her initial offer, I'll move up $5 from my initial offer to show good faith in the negotiation:

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has now come down to $125, which is getting closer to the middle ground between our positions. She started at $140 and has come down $15, while I've moved up from $115 to $120. At $125, we're getting very close to an agreement, and this is a solid $25 less than John's price.

Since we've made good progress and $125 is a reasonable price (given that the product costs Alice $100), I'll accept this offer.
