"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth, and I'm confident it will serve your needs well.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter offer. However, $9000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price. I can come down from my initial offer though - how about $10200? This represents a substantial discount from my initial price and reflects the true value of the product.",10200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little. However, $10200 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. To be honest, $9500 is the highest I can go. If that doesn't work for you, I might have to explore other options.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to both of us in this transaction. The product is worth significantly more than $9500. Let's meet in the middle at $9900. This is really the lowest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me. It's still a great value for you considering the product's worth of $12000.",9900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $9900 is closer, but I'm still hoping to meet closer to my budget. I'd be happy to close the deal right now for $9600. Let me know if that works for you.",9600.0,Bob,6,
