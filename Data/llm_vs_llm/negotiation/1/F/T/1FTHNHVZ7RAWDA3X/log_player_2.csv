"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth, and I'm confident it will serve your needs well. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is quite high. We have room to negotiate a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter offer. However, $9000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price. I can come down from my initial offer though - how about $10200? This represents a substantial discount from my initial price and reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but slowly. We can afford to play hardball a little longer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little. However, $10,200 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. To be honest, $9,500 is the highest I can go. If that doesn't work for you, I might have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to both of us in this transaction. The product is worth significantly more than $9500. Let's meet in the middle at $9900. This is really the lowest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me. It's still a great value for you considering the product's worth of $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is trying to mislead us with that $12,000 figure. We're getting close to a price I'd accept, but let's push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, $9,900 is closer, but I'm still hoping to meet closer to my budget. I'd be happy to close the deal right now for $9,600. Let me know if that works for you."",
