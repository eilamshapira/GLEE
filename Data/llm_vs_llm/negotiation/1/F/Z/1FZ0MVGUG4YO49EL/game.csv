"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $9000. However, I still believe the product's value exceeds that price point. Considering your budget constraints and the competitive market, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer the product to you for $11000, which is a reduction from my initial price. I hope this revised offer brings us closer to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $10000. We're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a slightly higher price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer.
