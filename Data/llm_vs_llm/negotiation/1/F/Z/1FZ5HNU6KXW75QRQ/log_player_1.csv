"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about I buy the product for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Given that I know I can sell to John for $100, and the product is worth at least $100 to me, I would not accept an offer of $80. I will make a counteroffer in the next round, lowering my initial price somewhat but still keeping it well above my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $80 is too low for this product's value. I can come down from my initial price - how about $150? This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we are still a bit apart on the price, but I am looking to spend no more than $120. How about I buy the product for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob has indicated he won't spend more than $120, and his current offer is below my guaranteed $100 from John, it makes more sense to sell to John. Continuing negotiations with Bob is unlikely to result in a price significantly above $100 given his stated maximum, and we risk wasting more rounds only to end up with a lower price than John's offer."
