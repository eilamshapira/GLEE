Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about a strategic price for this offer.

Since the product is worth $80 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, I can be somewhat aggressive in my pricing to Bob. Setting a high initial price gives me room to potentially earn more, while still having the $80 fallback with John.

I'll set the price at $120, which:
1. Gives me a good potential profit above my $80 minimum
2. Is high enough to capture value if Bob values the product highly
3. Still leaves room for negotiation if needed
4. Has no downside since I have the $80 backup offer from John
