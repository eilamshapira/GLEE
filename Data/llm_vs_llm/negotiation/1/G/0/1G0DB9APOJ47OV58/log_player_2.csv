"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Looking at the options:

1. Alice is offering the product for $120
2. If I reject Alice's offer, I would still need the product
3. I can buy from John for $120

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($120), and the product is worth no more than $120 to me, there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other.
