"Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $9500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth, and it represents a good opportunity for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe the product is valuable, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'd be willing to pay that price for the product.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I cannot accept $7000 as this is below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value, and I know it's worth $10000 on the market. I could come down to $9000, which would still give you excellent value while allowing me a fair return. This represents a $1000 reduction from my initial offer and would be a win-win for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand that $7000 was a bit low, I still believe $9000 is higher than I'm comfortable paying. Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, I'd like to propose a price of $7500. This price reflects a compromise between your initial offer and my previous counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
