"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $9500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth, and it represents a good opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I cannot accept $7000 as this is below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value, and I know it's worth $10000 on the market. I could come down to $9000, which would still give you excellent value while allowing me a fair return. This represents a $1000 reduction from my initial offer and would be a win-win for both of us.
