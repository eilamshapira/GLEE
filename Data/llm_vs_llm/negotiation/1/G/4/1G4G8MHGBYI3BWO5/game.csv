"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $15000 might be out of your budget, but $7000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $12000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $12000, but it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $8000. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $8000. I'm also willing to compromise further. I can offer the product to you for $10500. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
