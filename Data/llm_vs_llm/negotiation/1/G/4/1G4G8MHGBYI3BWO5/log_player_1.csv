Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its worth."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $7000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us. My counteroffer will be $12,000. This is still below my initial offer but higher than Bob's counteroffer, indicating that I'm willing to negotiate but not go as low as $7,000. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $15,000 might be out of your budget, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.""}"

Bob's offer:

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since he's willing to increase his offer, I'll decrease mine slightly, trying to find a mutually agreeable price. My next counteroffer will be $10,500. This shows I'm willing to continue negotiating but also indicates that I have a limit to how low I'm willing to go.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $8,000. I'm also willing to compromise further. I can offer the product to you for $10,500.
