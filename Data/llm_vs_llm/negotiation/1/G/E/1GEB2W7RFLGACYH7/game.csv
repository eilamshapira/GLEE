"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $11000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I still believe the product is worth more than your offer. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'd like to propose a price of $13500, which I think is a fair reflection of the product's value. Let me know if this price works for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still think $13500 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. Considering we both want to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. I'd like to propose a price of $12000. I believe this is a reasonable offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
