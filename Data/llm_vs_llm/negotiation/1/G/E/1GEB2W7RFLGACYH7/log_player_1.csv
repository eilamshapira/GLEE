Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $11,000 because it's still lower than my initial offer, and I believe the product is worth more to him ($15,000). I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to meet in the middle and maximize my earnings. 

My counteroffer: $13,500. This price is closer to the value Bob has for the product, and it's still a compromise from my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $11,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I still believe the product is worth more than your offer. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'd like to propose a price of $13,500, which I think is a fair reflection of the product's value. Let me know if this price works for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still think $13500 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. Considering we both want to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. I'd like to propose a price of $12000. I believe this is a reasonable offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I accept Bob's offer of $12,000. Although it's still slightly lower than my previous counteroffer, I believe it's a reasonable price considering the negotiation process. Bob has shown willingness to compromise and meet me closer to the middle, and $12,000 is a significant amount that's closer to the value Bob has for the product ($15,000). Accepting this offer ensures I earn a substantial amount for the product, and it's higher than the alternative of selling it to John for $10,000."
