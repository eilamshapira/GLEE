"Hello Bob, I have a quality product for sale. Given its features and value, I'm offering it to you for $200. This is a competitive price for this type of product.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I can offer $60 for the product. It's a fair amount and would help me stay within my budget.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand budget constraints, but $60 is significantly below the product's value. The product costs me $150, so I can't sell it for less than that. However, I can offer it to you for $170, which is already a reduction from my initial price.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $170 is still quite high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I can offer $70 for the product. This way, we both make some concessions.",70.0,Bob,4,
