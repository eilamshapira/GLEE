"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a quality product for sale. Given its features and value, I'm offering it to you for $200. This is a competitive price for this type of product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if Alice is willing to lower her price. The product is worth $150 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I can offer $60 for the product. It's a fair amount and would help me stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 60}

Let's start the negotiation low and see how Alice responds. If she's willing to negotiate, we might be able to find a good middle ground. If not, I can always consider John's offer later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand budget constraints, but $60 is significantly below the product's value. The product costs me $150, so I can't sell it for less than that. However, I can offer it to you for $170, which is already a reduction from my initial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer is still much higher than my budget, so let's make another counteroffer. I'll increase my offer a bit to show good faith in negotiating, but I'll still keep it much lower than Alice's asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $170 is still quite high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I can offer $70 for the product. This way, we both make some concessions."", ""product_price"": 70}

I've increased my offer a bit, but it's still much lower than Alice's latest offer. Let's see if she's willing to negotiate further. We still have a few rounds left to find a good deal."
