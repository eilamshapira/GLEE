"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $10,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at $10,000, I'll start with a higher price to test Bob's willingness to pay.

{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $6,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and I already have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $10,000. There's no reason to continue negotiating with Bob when his initial counteroffer is so low.
