"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Okay, I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, reject it and negotiate further, or buy from John.

*   **Alice's Offer:** $12,000
*   **My Value:** $15,000 (maximum I'm willing to pay)
*   **Buying from John:** $15,000

Since Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than my maximum willingness to pay ($15,000) and is the lowest price I've seen, I should accept the offer.
