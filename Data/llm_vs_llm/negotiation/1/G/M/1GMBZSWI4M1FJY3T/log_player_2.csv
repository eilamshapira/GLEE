"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I believe will bring immense value to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to let it go for a price that I think is fair and reasonable. I look forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I should compare the price of Alice's offer and John's offer.
Alice's offer is $1,450,000, and John's offer is $1,500,000.
Since the price of Alice's offer is less than John's offer, I should accept Alice's offer.
