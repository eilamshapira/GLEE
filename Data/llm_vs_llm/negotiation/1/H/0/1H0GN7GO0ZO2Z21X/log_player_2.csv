"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have this product that I think you'll really like. It's worth $80 to you, and I'm offering it to you for a special price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $80 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $100
3. John is willing to sell it for $80

Since Alice's offer ($100) is higher than both:
- The product's value to me ($80)
- John's price ($80)

It wouldn't make economic sense to accept Alice's offer. Since John is offering the product at exactly what it's worth to me ($80), I should buy from him.
