Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm setting the price at $12,000 because:
1. The product is worth $10,000 to me, so I won't sell below that
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $10,000
3. If Bob rejects the offer (likely since it's above his $8,000 valuation), I can still sell to John
4. There's a small chance Bob might accept if he has other motivations or values not mentioned"
