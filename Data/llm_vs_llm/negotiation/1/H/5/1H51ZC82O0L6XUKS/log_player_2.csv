"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's offer, the rational choice is to buy from John for $8,000. This saves me $4,000 compared to Alice's offer and matches my maximum valuation of the product."
