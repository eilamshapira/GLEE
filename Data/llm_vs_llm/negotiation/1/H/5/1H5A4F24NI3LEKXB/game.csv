"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  Let's meet in the middle.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $125, but I'm still a bit short of that. I'd be willing to meet you at $90. Would that work for you?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $90 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? I'm flexible to close this deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to go up a bit, but $105 is still a bit out of my range. How about we meet at $97? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",97.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $97 is getting closer, but I'm still not there yet. Let's try $101.  I'm really hoping we can close this deal.",101.0,Alice,7,
