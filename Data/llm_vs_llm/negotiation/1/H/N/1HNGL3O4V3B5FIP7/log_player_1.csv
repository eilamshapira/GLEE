Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to counter with a more reasonable offer for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's counteroffer of $8,000 is the minimum value I have for the product, and I also have the option to sell it to John for the same price, I don't see a benefit in accepting Bob's offer over selling to John, as both options give me the same amount of money. However, I still have the potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer, hoping to find a middle ground that is more favorable to me.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that my initial price might have been a bit steep, but I believe the product's value lies somewhere in between our offers. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your interest and my initial offer, I'd like to propose a counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
