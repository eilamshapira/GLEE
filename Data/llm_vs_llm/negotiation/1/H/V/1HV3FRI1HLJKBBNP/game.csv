"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand that $1000000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value is closer to that. I'm willing to negotiate and make a counteroffer of $900000. I hope this price is more suitable for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and settle on a price. While $675000 is closer, I was thinking more along the lines of $725000, considering the product's value and our previous discussions. Would you be open to this price?",725000.0,Alice,7,
