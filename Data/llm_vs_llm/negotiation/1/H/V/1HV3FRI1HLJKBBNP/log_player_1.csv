Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering this product. While I agree it seems valuable,  $1000000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $500,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. My counteroffer will be $900,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but there's still a significant gap between our valuations. To be frank, I'm considering other options closer to $600000. Would that price range be workable for you?

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $600,000 is still below my desired price. Since Bob mentioned considering other options closer to $600,000, I'll try to meet him halfway between my previous offer and his new suggestion. My counteroffer will be $750,000.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your honesty about considering other options. I'm willing to continue negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for understanding. I appreciate you moving towards a compromise.  How about we settle this right now at $675000? That's a fair offer, splitting the difference. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $675,000.

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $675,000 is still below my desired price, but I also don't want to lose the opportunity to sell to him. Since Bob suggested splitting the difference, I'll try to find a middle ground that's closer to my previous offer. My counteroffer will be $725,000, which is slightly below my previous offer of $750,000 but still higher than Bob's offer of $675,000.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and settle on a price. While $675,000 is closer, I was thinking more along the lines of $725,000, considering the product's value and our previous discussions. Would you be open to this price?"", ""product_price"": 725000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close, but that's still a bit high for me.  I can go up to $690000 as my final offer.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to go with a different option.

Since Bob's final offer of $690,000 is still below the price I can get from John ($800,000), and Bob has indicated that he won't be able to go any higher, I've decided to sell the product to John for $800,000. This ensures I get a better price for the product."
