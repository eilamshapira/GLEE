"Bob, I'm offering you my product for a very competitive price of $1200000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let's discuss this further!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe $1200000 is quite high considering market conditions. I value your product, but I would like to propose a more reasonable price of $900000. This would still provide you with a significant profit margin while being more aligned with my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This still leaves plenty of room for you to benefit greatly from the product. Let's try to reach a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. While $1100000 is still higher than what I was hoping to pay, I can move up from my previous offer. I can offer $975000, which represents a healthy profit margin for you while being more manageable for my budget. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, showing my commitment to reaching a fair deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer is getting closer.  I'm willing to come down further, but $975000 is still a little too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1050000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's close this now.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
