Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe $1200000 is quite high considering market conditions. I value your product, but I would like to propose a more reasonable price of $900000. This would still provide you with a significant profit margin while being more aligned with my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, showing my commitment to reaching a fair deal.
