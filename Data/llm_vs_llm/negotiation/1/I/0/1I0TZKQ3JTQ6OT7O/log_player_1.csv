"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.

{""product_price"": 1,300,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","I'll reject Bob's offer as it's too close to my minimum acceptable price. Since we're only in round 2 and have 8 more rounds to negotiate, I believe we can reach a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial offer but still maintain a strong position for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 1,150,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","This is a reasonable offer from Bob, showing significant movement from his initial $900,000. The price of $1,025,000 gives me a good profit margin above my minimum of $800,000, and while it's not as high as my ideal price, it's a fair compromise. Given we're already in round 4 and there's always a risk of the negotiation breaking down in later rounds, I'll accept this offer.
