"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable paying, and I have the option to negotiate further or buy from John at $1,500,000, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's initial offer was $1,300,000 and the product is worth $800,000 to her, I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than her initial offer but still reasonable, hoping to start a negotiation process that benefits both parties.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,150,000 is a reduction from her initial offer, indicating she's willing to negotiate. However, it's still higher than what I'm aiming to pay. Since I have the option to continue negotiating and my budget allows for it, I'll reject this offer as well and proceed to make another counteroffer, trying to meet somewhere in the middle or closer to the value I perceive.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice has reduced her price to $1,150,000, it shows she is willing to negotiate. My previous offer of $900,000 was rejected, so I'll increase my offer slightly to show I'm serious about buying the product and to encourage further negotiation. I'll aim for a midpoint between my last offer and Alice's current offer.
