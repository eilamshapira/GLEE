Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, I'm hoping we can agree on a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to consider selling it for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target price. $110 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $135.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks, Alice. I understand the value you're placing on the product. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I think that's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

$120 is still a bit too low for me. Since Bob is willing to meet in the middle, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's closer to my target price, but also shows I'm willing to compromise. I'll send a new offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for trying to meet in the middle. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $130.
