"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is too high. While she's expressed interest in finding a ""competitive price,"" her initial offer is the maximum value it holds for her. There's room for negotiation, and I know I have a backup option with John."
