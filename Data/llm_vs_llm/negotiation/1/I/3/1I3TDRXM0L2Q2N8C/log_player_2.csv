"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's initial offer is $150, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and I also have the option to buy it from John for the same price, I don't see any benefit in accepting Alice's offer without trying to negotiate a better price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in hopes of getting a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, in an attempt to gauge her willingness to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has made a counteroffer of $140, which is $10 lower than her initial offer and $10 lower than what I can buy it from John. This indicates that she is willing to negotiate, but the price is still relatively high.

I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get an even better deal. Since my initial counteroffer of $75 was rejected, I'll try to meet Alice halfway between her new offer and my initial counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll make a new counteroffer of $107.50."
