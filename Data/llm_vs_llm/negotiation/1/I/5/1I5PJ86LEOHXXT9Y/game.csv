"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it! I'm offering it to you for a great price. What do you think about $150?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $150 is above my budget. I can get a similar product from another seller for $120. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can find a fair price. Would you consider $90 for the product? This would be a great deal for me and hopefully still profitable for you.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate that you're interested. I can't go down to $90, as I have some costs to cover. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I can still get this product from John for $120, so paying $130 doesn't make financial sense for me. I'd be happy to pay $105, which saves me some money compared to John's offer while giving you a sale. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the continued interest. I understand you can get a similar product for $120, but I believe the quality of mine is superior. Considering that, and knowing I need to make a profit, the lowest I can go is $125. That's a good deal for a great product. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price and your confidence in your product's quality. However, for my needs, I still can't justify paying more than what John is offering at $120. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I'd need to save at least a little. My final offer is $115 - this gives you a sale today and saves me a bit compared to my alternative. Does that work for you?",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I want to make this work. Given the time we've invested and the benefits of my product, I'll meet you at $120. That's my final offer. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,7,
