"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is far beyond what I'm willing to invest. How about we negotiate at $5000 for the product? Let me know if that works for you.",5000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $5000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $15000. Let me know if this works for you.",15000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the value of this product justifies a higher price. How about we settle at $12000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and should meet you halfway.",12000.0,Alice,3,
