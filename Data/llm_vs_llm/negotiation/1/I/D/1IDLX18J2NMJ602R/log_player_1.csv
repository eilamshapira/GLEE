Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is far beyond what I'm willing to invest. How about we negotiate at $5000 for the product? Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the value of this product justifies a higher price. How about we settle at $12,000?
