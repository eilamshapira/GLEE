"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its rarity and the significant value it will bring to you, I'm initially offering it at $17000.",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $17000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $12000 to me, which is actually the price John is offering me for the same item. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $10500 for the product, which gives you a chance to beat John's price while still keeping within my valuation constraints.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. I understand your budget concerns, but the product holds significant value, even beyond John's offer. I'm willing to come down from my initial price. How about we meet in the middle-ish? My counteroffer is $16000.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on your price, Alice. However, $16000 is still well above what I can justify spending. As I mentioned, John is offering the identical product for $12000, which is already at the absolute maximum of what this product is worth to me. Since I'd prefer to do business with you, I'm willing to offer $11000. This is still below what I'd pay John, giving you a chance to make the sale while respecting my budget constraints. If we can't get closer to this range, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,
