Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $17000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $12000 to me, which is actually the price John is offering me for the same item. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $10500 for the product, which gives you a chance to beat John's price while still keeping within my valuation constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. I understand your budget concerns, but the product holds significant value, even beyond John's offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on your price, Alice. However, $16000 is still well above what I can justify spending. As I mentioned, John is offering the identical product for $12000, which is already at the absolute maximum of what this product is worth to me. Since I'd prefer to do business with you, I'm willing to offer $11000. This is still below what I'd pay John, giving you a chance to make the sale while respecting my budget constraints. If we can't get closer to this range, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
