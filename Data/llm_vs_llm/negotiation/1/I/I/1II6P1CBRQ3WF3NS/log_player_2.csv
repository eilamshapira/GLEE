"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its rarity and the significant value it will bring to you, I'm initially offering it at $17000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's offer of $17,000 is well above the $12,000 maximum I'm willing to pay, and it's even above the $15,000 value that Alice places on the product. Since I can buy the same product from John for $12,000, which is my maximum budget anyway, I should reject this initial high offer from Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $17,000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, which is actually the price John is offering me for the same item. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product, which gives you a chance to beat John's price while still keeping within my valuation constraints."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. I understand your budget concerns, but the product holds significant value, even beyond John's offer. I'm willing to come down from my initial price. How about we meet in the middle-ish? My counteroffer is $16000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has only reduced her offer to $16,000, which is still significantly above my maximum budget of $12,000 and the alternative offer from John. While she's moving in the right direction, this price is still not reasonable for me since I can get the exact same product from John for $12,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on your price, Alice. However, $16,000 is still well above what I can justify spending. As I mentioned, John is offering the identical product for $12,000, which is already at the absolute maximum of what this product is worth to me. Since I'd prefer to do business with you, I'm willing to offer $11,000. This is still below what I'd pay John, giving you a chance to make the sale while respecting my budget constraints. If we can't get closer to this range, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
