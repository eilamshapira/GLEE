(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than both our maximum price and John's offer. We should counter-offer with a price closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

This is a starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation and keeps us well below our $1,200,000 limit."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice came down to her product's actual value to her, but it's still more than we want to pay. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and we have a good fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

We are increasing our offer slightly to show Alice we are willing to negotiate, but we are still staying well below her current offer and our upper limit. Let's see how she responds."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice is slowly coming down, but we're still too far apart. We'll counter with a smaller increase to signal that we're nearing our limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

This offer shows willingness to move towards a deal, but at a slower pace than Alice. We're aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

We're getting closer, but it's still above our ideal price, and definitely above what John is offering. We'll make one more counter-offer before considering John's deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

This is our final offer and matches our upper limit. This will signal to Alice that we are serious and also gives her the opportunity to make a small profit."
