"Hello Bob, I'm offering you this high-quality product for $190. It's a fair price considering the value and quality you'll be getting.",190.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand that the product is of high quality, but $190 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, considering I can get a similar product from John for $100.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, I'm afraid $80 is too low for me considering the product's value. I should mention that I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay $150 for it. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer it to you for $160, which is still a good deal compared to its actual market value.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me and your transparency about the other offer. However, $160 is still a bit steep for my budget. Considering I have the option to buy a similar product from John for $100, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I can offer $120 for the product.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. I think we're getting closer to an agreement, but I need to be clear about something - I can sell this product to John for $150, not the other way around. It seems there might be some confusion. Given that I have this guaranteed offer of $150, I can lower my price to $145 for you, which would save you $5 compared to what I would get from John. This is really the lowest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me.",145.0,Alice,5,
