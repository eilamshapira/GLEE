Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand that the product is of high quality, but $190 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, considering I can get a similar product from John for $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, I'm afraid $80 is too low for me considering the product's value. I should mention that I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay $150 for it. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer it to you for $160, which is still a good deal compared to its actual market value."", ""product_price"": 160}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me and your transparency about the other offer. However, $160 is still a bit steep for my budget. Considering I have the option to buy a similar product from John for $100, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I can offer $120 for the product.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. I think we're getting closer to an agreement, but I need to be clear about something - I can sell this product to John for $150, not the other way around. It seems there might be some confusion. Given that I have this guaranteed offer of $150, I can lower my price to $145 for you, which would save you $5 compared to what I would get from John. This is really the lowest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me."", ""product_price"": 145}"
