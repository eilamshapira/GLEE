Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand that the product is of high quality, but $190 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, considering I can get a similar product from John for $100."", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, I'm afraid $80 is too low for me considering the product's value. I should mention that I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay $150 for it. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer it to you for $160, which is still a good deal compared to its actual market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160

Round 4

However, $160 is still a bit steep for my budget.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. I think we're getting closer to an agreement, but I need to be clear about something - I can sell this product to John for $150, not the other way around. It seems there might be some confusion. Given that I have this guaranteed offer of $150, I can lower my price to $145 for you, which would save you $5 compared to what I would get from John. This is really the lowest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
