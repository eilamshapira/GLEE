"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value of $15,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

My counteroffer will be $19,000.
