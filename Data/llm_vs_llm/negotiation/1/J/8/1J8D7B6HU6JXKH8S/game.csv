"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I feel the price is a bit high. I'm willing to purchase the product for $1000000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down from my initial price, but I need to ensure I'm receiving fair compensation. My new offer is $1750000. This represents a $250000 reduction from my initial price and reflects the product's true market value. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for increasing your offer, Bob. I appreciate you moving closer to a fair price. However, $1200000 is still significantly below what this product is worth. I should mention that I have another interested buyer, John, who is prepared to pay $1500000 for the product. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. My new offer is $1600000, which represents a $400000 reduction from my initial price. This is a competitive offer considering the product's value and market demand.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
