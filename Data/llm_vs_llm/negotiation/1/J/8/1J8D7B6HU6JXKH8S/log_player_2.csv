Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down from my initial price, but I need to ensure I'm receiving fair compensation. My new offer is $1750000. This represents a $250000 reduction from my initial price and reflects the product's true market value. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.
