"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering you this product for $120. I believe it's a fantastic deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let's analyze the situation.

*   **Alice's Offer:** $120
*   **My Valuation:** $150 (maximum I'm willing to pay)
*   **John's Offer:** $150

I should **RejectOffer**. $120 is better than $150, but I can try to get a better deal.

So the answer is:
```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, I'll make a counteroffer. I want to get the price down as much as possible, but I don't want to risk losing the deal. I'll start by offering a price slightly above what the product is worth to Alice.

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was hoping to get a better price. Would you consider selling it to me for $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob! I appreciate your interest. How about I sell it to you for $110? I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let's analyze this new offer:

*   **Alice's Offer:** $110
*   **My Valuation:** $150 (maximum I'm willing to pay)
*   **John's Offer:** $150

$110 is better than $150. I could try to negotiate further, but the difference is getting smaller. It's a good deal at this point. I'll accept.

So the answer is:
```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```"
