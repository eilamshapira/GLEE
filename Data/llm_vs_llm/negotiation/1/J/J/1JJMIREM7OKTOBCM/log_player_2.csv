"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product at $150, which is exactly the same price that Jhon is willing to sell it for. This means there's no advantage to buying from Jhon instead of accepting Alice's current offer.

However, the product is worth no more than $150 to me, so this price is at my absolute maximum threshold. If I can negotiate with Alice for a lower price, that would be preferable.

Since there's no disadvantage to rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer (I can always fall back to the $150 price with Jhon), I should try to negotiate a better deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has now offered the product for $120, which is $30 less than both her original offer and Jhon's price. This is a significantly better deal than the $150 option.

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and Alice's offer of $120 is well below that threshold, this is a good deal. I could try to negotiate further, but Alice has already come down substantially from her initial offer, and there's a risk she might not go much lower or could even withdraw this offer.

Given that I'm saving $30 compared to my alternative option (buying from Jhon), I should accept this offer.
