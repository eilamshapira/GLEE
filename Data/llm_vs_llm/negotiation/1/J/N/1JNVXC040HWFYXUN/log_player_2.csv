"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and features, I'm valuing it at $20000.  Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Based on the information provided:

1. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $20,000
3. John (alternative seller) will sell it for $15,000

Since Alice's price ($20,000) exceeds both the product's value to me and John's alternative offer, the economically rational decision is to buy from John instead.
