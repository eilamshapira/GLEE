"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the exclusive opportunity, your price of $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I know there are similar products on the market for much less. In fact, I have another offer from John for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a more reasonable price. Given market conditions and my budget constraints, I can offer you $1200000 for the product. This would allow me some room under my maximum budget of $1500000 while still providing you with a fair price. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer and understand your budget constraints. However, considering the uniqueness and high demand for this product, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1750000. This is a mid-point that benefits both of us, providing you with an exceptional product and me with fair compensation. Let me know if this works for you.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for coming down on your price. I do appreciate the quality of your product, but I need to be prudent with my budget. As I mentioned, John is offering a similar product for $1500000, which is my absolute maximum budget limit. To make it worth choosing your product over John's, I would need a better price. I can offer you $1400000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and gives you a quick sale without further negotiations. This is very close to my maximum budget while still providing you with a fair compensation for your product. Would this work for you?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
