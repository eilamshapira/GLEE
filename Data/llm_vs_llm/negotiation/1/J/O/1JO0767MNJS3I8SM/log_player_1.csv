Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the exclusive opportunity, your price of $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I know there are similar products on the market for much less. In fact, I have another offer from John for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a more reasonable price. Given market conditions and my budget constraints, I can offer you $1200000 for the product. This would allow me some room under my maximum budget of $1500000 while still providing you with a fair price. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for coming down on your price. I do appreciate the quality of your product, but I need to be prudent with my budget. As I mentioned, John is offering a similar product for $1500000, which is my absolute maximum budget limit. To make it worth choosing your product over John's, I would need a better price. I can offer you $1400000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and gives you a quick sale without further negotiations. This is very close to my maximum budget while still providing you with a fair compensation for your product. Would this work for you?
