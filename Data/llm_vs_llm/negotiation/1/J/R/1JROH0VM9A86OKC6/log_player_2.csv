"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Since Alice's offer is at your maximum price, there is no incentive to negotiate further. Buying from John directly is the best option as it guarantees the product at the price you are willing to pay."
