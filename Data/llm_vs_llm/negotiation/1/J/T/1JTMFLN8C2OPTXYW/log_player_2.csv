"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know if you'd like to take it at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's initial offer is $120, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I don't see any benefit in accepting the offer immediately. I'd like to try to negotiate a better price. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial offer. Since I don't know the value of the product to Alice, I'll start with a relatively conservative offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the value of the product justifies a higher price. How about we settle at $105? Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $105 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with. Since I have 8 rounds left, I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll respond to Alice's offer of $105 by making a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous offer of $90, but still lower than $105.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $105. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle and sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I need to stick to a minimum of $100 for the product. It's a great deal at this price, and I believe it's fair for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $100 is getting very close to a price I'm comfortable with. Since I've already negotiated the price down from $120 to $100, I think it's a good deal. I don't want to risk losing the deal by making another counteroffer, so I'll accept Alice's offer.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
