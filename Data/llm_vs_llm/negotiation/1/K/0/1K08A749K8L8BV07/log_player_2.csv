"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice's offer is $120, which is $30 less than John's price
3. While I could try to negotiate for an even lower price by making a counteroffer, Alice's current offer is already reasonable and saves me $30
4. There's a risk that if I reject and make a counteroffer, the negotiation might not lead to a better deal

Given these factors, Alice's offer of $120 is a good deal as it's well below my maximum value and provides significant savings compared to John's price. It would be prudent to accept this offer rather than risk losing it by trying to negotiate further.
