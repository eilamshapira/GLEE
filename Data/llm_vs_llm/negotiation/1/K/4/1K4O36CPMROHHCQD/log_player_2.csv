"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. It's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $100
2. Alice's offer is $140, which is above my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $100, which matches my maximum value
4. Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price

Given that:
- Alice's offer ($140) is well above my maximum value ($100)
- John's guaranteed price ($100) equals my maximum value
- There's no guarantee that negotiating with Alice will lead to a better price than John's

The rational decision is to buy from John immediately rather than accept Alice's high offer or enter into uncertain negotiations.
