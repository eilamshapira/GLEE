Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Okay, considering Bob's counteroffer of $9,500 and my minimum value of $10,000, I will reject the offer and send a counteroffer.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough spot. Bob is now offering my minimum acceptable price. However, I know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and I could potentially get more. But, if I push too hard, I might lose the sale entirely.

Considering I can sell to John for $10,000, I am tempted to accept Bob's offer.
