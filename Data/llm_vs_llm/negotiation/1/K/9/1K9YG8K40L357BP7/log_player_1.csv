"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get more than my minimum acceptable price of $80.

{""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","I'll reject Bob's offer of $60 since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I can always sell to John for $80, so there's no reason to accept anything lower.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat but still keep it above my minimum of $80.

{""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer of $70 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80. At this point, since Bob is still offering below my minimum and we've already gone through several rounds, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed $80 from John.
