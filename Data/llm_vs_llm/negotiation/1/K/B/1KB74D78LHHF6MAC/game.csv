"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1000000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This reflects my understanding of its value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1000000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product is worth more than $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900000. This price reflects its true value, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of the product, $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825000. This is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",825000.0,Bob,4,
