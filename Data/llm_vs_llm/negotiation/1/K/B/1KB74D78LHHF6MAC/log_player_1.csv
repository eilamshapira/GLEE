Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1000000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This reflects my understanding of its value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. My counteroffer will be $900,000. This price still reflects the product's value and gives Bob a chance to reconsider his budget. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,000,000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product is worth more than $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This price reflects its true value, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of the product, $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825000. This is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Since Bob's offer of $825,000 is higher than John's offer of $800,000 and closer to my initial valuation, I'm willing to accept this offer. It seems like a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by pushing for a higher price."
