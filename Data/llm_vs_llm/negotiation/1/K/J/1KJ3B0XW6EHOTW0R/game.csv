"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that the product is of high quality, but $25000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, considering the market value and my own financial constraints.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, after considering your counteroffer, I'm willing to lower my initial offer. I believe that a price of $20000 is more fair to both parties, given the exceptional value that this product can bring to you. ",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for reconsidering and lowering the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $20000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. This is also the price at which I can buy it from another seller, so I hope we can meet at this price.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, after careful consideration, I'm willing to make another adjustment to the price. I can offer the product to you for $17000. This price takes into account your budget constraints while also reflecting the product's true value.",17000.0,Alice,5,
