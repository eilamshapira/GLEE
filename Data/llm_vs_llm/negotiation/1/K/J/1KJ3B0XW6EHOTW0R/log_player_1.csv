Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that the product is of high quality, but $25000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, considering the market value and my own financial constraints.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. This is also the price at which I can buy it from another seller, so I hope we can meet at this price.
