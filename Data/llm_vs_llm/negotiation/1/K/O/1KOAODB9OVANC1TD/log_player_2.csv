"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll analyze this offer from Alice:

Alice's offer: $950,000
My maximum value: $1,000,000
John's fixed price: $1,000,000

Alice's offer is $50,000 less than what I'd have to pay John, which is good. However, I can likely negotiate a better price with Alice since the product is only worth $800,000 to her. This means she has room to go lower while still making a profit.

I should reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This gives me a chance to save even more money compared to either accepting her current offer or buying from John.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll analyze Alice's new offer:

Alice's initial offer: $950,000
My counteroffer: $850,000
Alice's new offer: $925,000
John's fixed price: $1,000,000

Alice has come down $25,000 from her initial price, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This new offer is $75,000 less than John's price, which is a significant saving. However, since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, she still has room to reduce the price further while maintaining a profit.

I should reject this offer and try one more round of negotiation to see if I can get an even better price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll analyze Alice's new offer:

Alice's initial offer: $950,000
My first counteroffer: $850,000
Alice's second offer: $925,000
My second counteroffer: $875,000
Alice's newest offer: $900,000
John's fixed price: $1,000,000

Alice has continued to negotiate and is now offering the product for $900,000, which is $100,000 less than John's price. She's moved down $50,000 from her initial offer.

The negotiation is converging - we're getting closer in our offers. Her current offer of $900,000 represents a good compromise and substantial savings compared to buying from John. Given that the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, she's still making a $100,000 profit, but I'm also saving $100,000 compared to my alternative option.

At this point, I should accept her offer rather than risk the negotiation breaking down or Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further.
