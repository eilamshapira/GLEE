"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was looking to spend less on this item. Given similar products in the market, I think $85 would be a fair price. This gives you $5 above your cost, and I get a reasonable deal as well. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm motivated to sell, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? This is a very fair price, given the value you receive in return for this item.",90.0,Alice,3,
