Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was looking to spend less on this item. Given similar products in the market, I think $85 would be a fair price. This gives you $5 above your cost, and I get a reasonable deal as well. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
