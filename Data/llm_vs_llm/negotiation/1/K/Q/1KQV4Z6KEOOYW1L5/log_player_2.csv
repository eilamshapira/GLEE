"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $95.  I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $95, make a counteroffer, or buy from John for $100.

Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice is offering it for $95, which is $5 less than John's price, it's a better deal than buying from John. However, I could potentially get an even better price by negotiating with Alice, especially since I know the product is worth $80 to her.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, as this gives me the opportunity to save more money.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was looking to spend less on this item. Given similar products in the market, I think $85 would be a fair price. This gives you $5 above your cost, and I get a reasonable deal as well. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm motivated to sell, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? This is a very fair price, given the value you receive in return for this item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has countered with $90, which is $10 less than John's price and represents significant savings. This is a reasonable counteroffer from Alice, moving down $5 from her initial price of $95.

Since the product is worth up to $100 to me and I know Alice's cost is $80, a price of $90 means we're essentially splitting the difference between her cost and my maximum value. This is a fair deal that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.

While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might not go much lower, and the $10 savings compared to John's price is already good. I'll accept this offer.
