"Hello Bob, I'm reaching out today to offer you a product that I believe could be valuable for you. I'm asking for $1400000. This is a fair market price for a product of this quality and value. I'd be happy to discuss the details further if you're interested.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering this product. While I agree it seems valuable, the price you're asking is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest and offer. While I appreciate your proposal, I need to point out that the product is worth significantly more than $1000000. I've already received a firm offer of $1200000 from another buyer, but I'm giving you the opportunity to purchase it first because I believe it would be a good fit for you. I can come down to $1300000, which is still a competitive price for this product's value. Let me know if this works for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  That other offer does make this a bit trickier.  To be completely honest, $1200000 is the very top of my budget. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I wish you the best with the other buyer.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
