Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest and offer. While I appreciate your proposal, I need to point out that the product is worth significantly more than $1,000,000. I've already received a firm offer of $1,200,000 from another buyer, but I'm giving you the opportunity to purchase it first because I believe it would be a good fit for you. I can come down to $1,300,000, which is still a competitive price for this product's value. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"

If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I wish you the best with the other buyer.
