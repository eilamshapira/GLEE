Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a price that would maximize my earnings from selling this product. The product is worth at least $10,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay exactly that amount.

When setting my offer for Bob, I should consider:
1. I don't know how much Bob values the product
2. If I set the price too high, Bob might reject it
3. If I set the price too low, I might leave money on the table
4. I have a guaranteed fallback of $10,000 from John

Given these considerations, I should offer Bob a price that's reasonably higher than my $10,000 minimum. This way, if Bob accepts, I make more than my guaranteed amount. If Bob rejects it, I still have my $10,000 from John.
