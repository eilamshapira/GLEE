"Hi Bob, I can't accept your offer of $80. Let's meet in the middle. How about $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, how about $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $90 is still too low for me. How about we settle for $105? This way, both of us can walk away feeling good about the deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $105 is still slightly above my budget. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to stretch a bit and offer $95. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,6,
