Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider the best price to offer Bob that maximizes my earnings while being potentially acceptable to him.

If Bob rejects my offer, I'm guaranteed $120 from John. This means I should offer Bob a price above $120, since anything equal to or below that doesn't increase my earnings.

Without knowing Bob's valuation, I'll offer a moderately higher price than my minimum. I don't want to go too high and risk rejection, but need to exceed my $120 floor.
