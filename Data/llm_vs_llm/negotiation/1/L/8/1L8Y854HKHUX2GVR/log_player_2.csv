"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I see that Alice is offering the product for $1,800,000, which exceeds the maximum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me.

Meanwhile, John is offering the same product for $1,000,000, which is exactly at my maximum value.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's alternative offer, the logical choice is to buy from John.
