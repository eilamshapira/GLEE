Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price that maximizes my profit while still being likely to be accepted by Bob.

Let me analyze this situation:
- The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob
- It's worth at least $800,000 to me
- If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $800,000

Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, theoretically he should be willing to pay up to that amount. However, if I price it too close to $1,500,000, he might reject the offer since he wouldn't make any profit. 

A reasonable approach would be to offer a price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. I'll set a price that gives Bob some incentive to accept while still significantly increasing my profit beyond the $800,000 I would get from John.
