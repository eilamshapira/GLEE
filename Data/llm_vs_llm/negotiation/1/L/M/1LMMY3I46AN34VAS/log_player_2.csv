"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering you the product for $110. I believe it's a great investment for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer is $110, which exceeds the $80 maximum value of the product to me. Additionally, I have the option to buy from John for $80, which matches the maximum I'm willing to pay. There's no reason to accept Alice's higher offer or continue negotiating when I can immediately get the product at my maximum acceptable price.
