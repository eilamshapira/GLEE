Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 13000}

I understand that Bob values the product less than I do, but I want to maximize my profit. I'm willing to negotiate, but I don't want to go too low too quickly. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still too low. I value the product at no less than $12,000, and John is willing to pay that much. It's better to sell to John than to accept Bob's offer of $9,500. I might be able to negotiate with Bob further, but there's no guarantee, and I don't want to risk losing the sure sale to John."
