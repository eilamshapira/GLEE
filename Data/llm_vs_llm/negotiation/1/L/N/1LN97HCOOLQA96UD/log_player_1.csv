Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no less than $100 to me, I will not accept Bob's offer of $90.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $90, which is lower than my minimum value of $100, I'll make a counteroffer that is still higher than my initial offer, but not excessively high.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $110 is higher than my minimum value of $100 and also higher than John's offer of $100, I will consider accepting it. However, I might be able to get a slightly better deal from Bob.

But considering the risk of losing the deal if I reject Bob's offer, and the fact that $110 is a good price, I will accept Bob's offer.
