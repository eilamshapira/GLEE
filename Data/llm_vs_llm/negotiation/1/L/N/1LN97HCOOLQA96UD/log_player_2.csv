"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offer ($150) is equal to my maximum valuation and equal to John's price
2. Since it's the first round, I should try to negotiate for a better price with Alice
3. By rejecting and making a counteroffer, I have the potential to save money
4. I still have John's offer as a backup, and I can always go back to that option

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since this is my first counteroffer, I'll start significantly lower to leave room for negotiation but not so low as to be unreasonable:

{""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let's analyze:
1. Alice has reduced her price from $150 to $140, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This is $10 less than John's price ($150)
3. We still have 7 more rounds of potential negotiation
4. Since Alice dropped her price by $10, there might be room for further reduction
5. The worst case is we can still go with John's offer later

Given these factors, I'll reject and try one more counteroffer since Alice has shown flexibility in pricing.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $150 to $140, showing some flexibility, and my previous offer of $90 was rejected, I'll increase my offer but still try to get a better deal:

{""product_price"": 110}"
