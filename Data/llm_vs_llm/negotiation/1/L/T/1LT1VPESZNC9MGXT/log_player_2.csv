"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to consider my options carefully:

1. Alice is offering the product for $150
2. The product is only worth $100 to me (my maximum value)
3. John is willing to sell me the same product for $100

Since Alice's price ($150) exceeds the value I place on the product ($100), and I can get it from John for exactly $100, it makes financial sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John.
