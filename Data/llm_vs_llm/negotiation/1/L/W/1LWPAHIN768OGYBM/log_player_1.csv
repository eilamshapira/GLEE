"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I need to consider my strategy carefully here. I know that the product is worth $120 to me, and only $100 to Bob. This means Bob won't rationally pay more than $100. However, I have the advantage of being able to sell to John for $120 at any time.

Given this situation, offering Bob a price near his valuation might be reasonable to see if he'll accept. If he counters with something too low, I can always fall back on John's offer.
