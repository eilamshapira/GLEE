"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering my product at $1000000. This is a fair price reflecting its unique value and quality. Please let me know if you accept or if youâ€™d like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's initial offer is at the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,000,000), and I know I can get the same product from John for the same price, I see no benefit in accepting Alice's offer immediately without trying to negotiate a better price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in hopes of getting a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range considering the product's value to me. Since I know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I'll start by offering a price that is lower than this, to leave room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I believe your product has value, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. I look forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, considering the quality and value of this product, I must adjust my price. I'm now willing to sell it for $900000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $900,000 is still quite high, especially considering that I know the product is worth $800,000 to her. This suggests there's still room for negotiation. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible and I haven't reached my maximum budget of $1,000,000, I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer.

This time, I'll increase my offer slightly from $600,000 to $700,000, trying to meet Alice halfway while still being mindful of my budget and the product's value to Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new counteroffer would be:

{""message"": ""Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, considering the product's quality and our ongoing negotiation. Looking forward to your next response."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
