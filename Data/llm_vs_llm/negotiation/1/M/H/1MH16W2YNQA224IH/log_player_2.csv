"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to consider the three options carefully:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $11,999
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $8,000

Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and John is offering it for exactly $8,000, Alice's offer of $11,999 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. It would make no sense for me to accept Alice's offer when I can get the same product for $3,999 less from John.
