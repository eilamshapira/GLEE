"Hello Bob, I'd like to offer you my premium product. Given its exceptional quality and the value it can bring to you, I'm setting the price at $18000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. I am open to discussing the price further if you have a different value in mind. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18000 is way above my budget. The maximum I'm willing to spend is $6000. Would you consider selling it for that price?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your response and for sharing your budget with me. I understand that we have a significant gap between our prices. However, I believe that the value the product can bring to you is much higher than $6000. Given that, I'm willing to lower my price to $15000. This is still considerably higher than your budget, but I think it's a more reasonable starting point for our negotiation. I can further consider your budget, but I need you to work with me and meet me in the middle. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $15000 is still too high for me. My absolute maximum is $7000, and even that's a stretch. I'm also talking to another seller who's offering a similar product for $8000. Can you come down to $7000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
