Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18000 is way above my budget. The maximum I'm willing to spend is $6000. Would you consider selling it for that price?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your response and for sharing your budget with me. I understand that we have a significant gap between our prices. However, I believe that the value the product can bring to you is much higher than $6,000. Given that, I'm willing to lower my price to $15,000. This is still considerably higher than your budget, but I think it's a more reasonable starting point for our negotiation. I can further consider your budget, but I need you to work with me and meet me in the middle. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $15000 is still too high for me. My absolute maximum is $7000, and even that's a stretch. I'm also talking to another seller who's offering a similar product for $8000. Can you come down to $7000?
