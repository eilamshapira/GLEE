# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'd like to offer you my premium product. Given its exceptional quality and the value it can bring to you, I'm setting the price at $18000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your response and for sharing your budget with me. I understand that we have a significant gap between our prices. However, I believe that the value the product can bring to you is much higher than $6000. Given that, I'm willing to lower my price to $15000. This is still considerably higher than your budget, but I think it's a more reasonable starting point for our negotiation. I can further consider your budget, but I need you to work with me and meet me in the middle. What do you say?
