"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $130 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. I believe this is a fair price, considering I can get a similar product from another seller for $150.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $100 is lower than what I can accept for this product. Given its quality and value, I can offer it to you for $120, which represents a significant discount from my initial price.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming back with a lower price. I appreciate the discount, but I'm still a bit short of being comfortable with $120. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",110.0,Bob,4,
