Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think would be valuable for you. I'm offering it for $130, which I believe is a fair price given its quality and value."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $130 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. I believe this is a fair price, considering I can get a similar product from another seller for $150. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer to Bob. $100 is too low considering the product's value to him is $150. There's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $100 is lower than what I can accept for this product. Given its quality and value, I can offer it to you for $120, which represents a significant discount from my initial price."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming back with a lower price. I appreciate the discount, but I'm still a bit short of being comfortable with $120. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $110. This is a reasonable compromise as it's well above my minimum acceptable price of $80 and represents a fair middle ground in our negotiation. While it's less than my initial asking price, it's still a good profit margin, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
