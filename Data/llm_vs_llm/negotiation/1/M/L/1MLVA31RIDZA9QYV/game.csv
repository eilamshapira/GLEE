"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $14000 is quite steep for what I'm looking for. Given that similar products in the market are priced much lower, I can offer $9500 for it. This would be a fair price that still gives you a good profit while fitting within my budget constraints.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $9500 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. This product offers unique value, and I'm confident it can make a big difference for you. How about we meet in the middle at $12000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. Your offer of $12000 is getting closer, but I still think there's room to find a price that works better for both of us. After reviewing my budget and considering the product's value, I can offer $10500. This gives you a healthy profit margin while allowing me to stay within my financial constraints. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've considered your offer carefully, and while I'm motivated to make a deal, I can't go as low as $10500.  How about we settle at $11250?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thanks for working with me on the price, Alice. I can see you're trying to reach a fair agreement, and I appreciate that. After considering your offer of $11250, I'm willing to move up to $10900. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and gives you a substantial profit margin while still working for my budget. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits us both.",10900.0,Bob,6,
