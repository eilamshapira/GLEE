Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $14000 is quite steep for what I'm looking for. Given that similar products in the market are priced much lower, I can offer $9500 for it. This would be a fair price that still gives you a good profit while fitting within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. Your offer of $12000 is getting closer, but I still think there's room to find a price that works better for both of us. After reviewing my budget and considering the product's value, I can offer $10500. This gives you a healthy profit margin while allowing me to stay within my financial constraints.

That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 11250}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for working with me on the price, Alice. I can see you're trying to reach a fair agreement, and I appreciate that. After considering your offer of $11250, I'm willing to move up to $10900. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and gives you a substantial profit margin while still working for my budget. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits us both.
