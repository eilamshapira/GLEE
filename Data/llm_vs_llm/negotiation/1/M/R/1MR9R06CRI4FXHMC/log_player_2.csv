"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to consider Alice's offer compared to the alternatives. 

The product is worth at most $12,000 to me, so paying $13,000 for it (Alice's current offer) would mean I'm losing value. Meanwhile, I know I can buy the product from John for exactly $12,000.

Since Alice's offer is higher than both my maximum valuation and John's guaranteed price, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice, keeping in mind that the product is worth $12,000 to her and that's also what I could pay John.

{""product_price"": $10,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price to $12,500, which is better than her initial offer but still above both my maximum valuation and John's price of $12,000. Since I can get the same product from John for $12,000, there's no reason for me to pay $12,500 to Alice.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer to Alice, slightly increasing my previous offer but still keeping it below John's price.

{""product_price"": $10,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has now offered the product at $12,000, which is exactly the same price John is offering and equal to the product's worth to Alice. This price is also at my maximum valuation threshold.

Since Alice's offer has now reached the same level as John's price, and further negotiation may not yield a better price (as Alice seems unlikely to go below the product's worth to her), I'll accept this offer.
