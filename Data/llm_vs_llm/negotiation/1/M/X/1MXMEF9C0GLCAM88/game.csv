"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $750000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000 to make this deal work. This price still reflects the product's potential, while giving you a reasonable discount.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1250000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your new offer and my previous counteroffer. I'll offer $1000000, which is the highest I'm comfortable paying.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
