"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it has great potential value for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the offered price of $1,500,000 exceeds my budget of $1,000,000, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of negotiating a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still shows that I'm interested in the product. Since I'm not sure what the product is worth to Alice, I'll start with a relatively low offer and see how she responds.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $750000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000 to make this deal work. This price still reflects the product's potential, while giving you a reasonable discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,250,000 is still above my budget of $1,000,000. While I appreciate her willingness to negotiate, I'm not ready to accept an offer that exceeds my budget.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer, trying to bring the price down even further. Since Alice has already come down from $1,500,000 to $1,250,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her new offer and my previous counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll send a new counteroffer: 

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your new offer and my previous counteroffer. I'll offer $1,000,000, which is the highest I'm comfortable paying."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
