"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given that Alice is offering the product for $15,000, and I can get the same product from John for $15,000, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer right now. Since I value the product at no more than $15,000, and I have the opportunity to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has lowered her price from $15,000 to $14,000, which is already $1,000 better than John's fixed price. Since this price is below the maximum I'm willing to pay and represents a good discount from my alternative option, I should accept this offer.
