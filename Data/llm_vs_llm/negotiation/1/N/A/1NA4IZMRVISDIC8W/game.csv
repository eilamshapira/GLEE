"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000, considering the current market conditions and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but I need to account for the true value of this product. I can come down to $13500, which is still below the market value and represents a good investment for you. This price reflects both the product's quality and my need to get a fair return.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I still think we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I'd like to propose a price of $12750. This way, we both make a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet me halfway. I can see that we're getting closer to an agreement. I'm willing to come down to $13200, which I believe is quite reasonable considering the $15000 value you'll be getting from this product. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and a good deal for both of us.",13200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the effort you're putting into finding a mutually agreeable price. Your last offer of $13200 is closer to what I'm willing to pay. However, I'd like to propose a price of $12900. This is a serious offer, and I'm willing to commit to purchasing the product at this price. I believe it's a fair compromise, considering the value we've both discussed.",12900.0,Bob,6,
