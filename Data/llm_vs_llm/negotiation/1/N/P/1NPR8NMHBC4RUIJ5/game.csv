"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out.  $14000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your position, $12000 is lower than I can accept for this product. Given its quality and value, I can come down to $13500. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of the product. I hope we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,
