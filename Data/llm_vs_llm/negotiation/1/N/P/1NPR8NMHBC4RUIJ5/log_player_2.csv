"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $14000. This is a fair price considering the quality and value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your position, $12000 is lower than I can accept for this product. Given its quality and value, I can come down to $13500. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of the product. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$13,500 is still a good price, and I'm happy to accept it. It's less than what John is offering, and closer to what I want to pay."
