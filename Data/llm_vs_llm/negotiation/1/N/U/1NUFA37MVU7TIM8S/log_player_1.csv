Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price to offer Bob.

Given that:
1. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,000,000 from John
3. My minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000

I should offer Bob a price that's high enough to maximize my profit but low enough that he'll still accept. Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, he would reject any offer above that. However, he would likely accept an offer that gives him some surplus value while still being significantly better for me than John's offer.

I'll offer the product at $1,150,000, which:
- Gives Bob $50,000 in surplus value ($1,200,000 - $1,150,000)
- Gives me $150,000 more than my backup offer from John
- Is a reasonable split of the $200,000 potential gains from trade
