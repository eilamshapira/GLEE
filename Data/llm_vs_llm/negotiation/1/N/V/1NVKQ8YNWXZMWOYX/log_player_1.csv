Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this:

1. The product is worth at least $800,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $800,000
3. Bob's valuation is unknown, but if he values it higher, I should try to capture some of that value
4. If I price too high, Bob will reject and I'll get $800,000 from John
5. A reasonable strategy would be to price significantly above $800,000 to try capturing higher value
