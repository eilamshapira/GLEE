"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Looking at the options:

1. Alice offers the product for $1,200,000
2. I can reject Alice's offer
3. I can buy from John for $1,500,000

Since Alice's price ($1,200,000) is lower than John's price ($1,500,000) and is within my budget constraint (no more than $1,500,000), the rational choice is to accept Alice's offer and save $300,000.
