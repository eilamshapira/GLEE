"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. My asking price is $1500000. I believe it's a fair value considering its worth. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given the situation, Alice is offering to sell me the product for $1,500,000, which is $300,000 more than what it's worth to me ($1,200,000). Since John is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $1,200,000 (which matches my maximum valuation), there's no reason to accept Alice's higher offer or continue negotiation.
