"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I need to make an offer to Bob for my product. Since I know the product is worth at least $150 to me, and I can always fall back to selling it to John for $150, I'll start with a higher offer to see what Bob is willing to pay.

{""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer of $50 is far below my minimum value of $150. I can sell to John for $150 guaranteed, so I'll reject this low offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my initial offer of $250 and countered with only $50, I'll come down from my initial price but still stay well above my minimum value.

{""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob has only increased his offer from $50 to $60, which is still far below my minimum acceptable value of $150. Since he's not making significant movement toward a reasonable price, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I notice Bob is only making very small increases in his offers, which suggests he might not value the product anywhere near my minimum price. I'll lower my price more significantly, but still keep it well above my minimum value.

{""product_price"": 175}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob continues to make only small increases ($50 → $60 → $70), which is still far below my minimum value of $150. At this rate, we won't reach a reasonable price in the remaining rounds. I'll stop negotiating with Bob and take the guaranteed $150 from John.
