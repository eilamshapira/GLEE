"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly beneficial. I'm asking for $18000 to start the conversation. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my market research and considering similar products, I would be comfortable starting at $7000. This is my initial offer, and I'm open to finding a middle ground that works for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $7000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  To move this forward, I can come down to $14000. I believe this price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your feedback.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $14000 is still significantly above what I can justify for this product. I can increase my offer to $8500, which is a substantial increase from my initial offer. This reflects my sincere interest in reaching an agreement, while staying within my budget constraints.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that. Let's find a middle ground. How about $11500? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it brings.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. I need to be transparent with you - I have another seller, John, who has offered this same product for $10000. I would prefer to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer $9500. This is very close to my absolute maximum budget, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you have other options, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget.  I'm willing to make one final move to close this deal.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10250?  This is a significant price reduction on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,7,
