"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly beneficial. I'm asking for $18000 to start the conversation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
2. Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly above my maximum value
3. I can buy the same product from John for $10,000
4. Alice's initial offer is very high, suggesting room for negotiation

I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Starting at $18,000 is clearly too high, and there's no reason to accept this when I have John's guaranteed offer of $10,000 as a backup.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower but still leaves room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $10,000 to me and that's my alternative option with John, I'll start low to have room for potential increases.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18,000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my market research and considering similar products, I would be comfortable starting at $7,000. This is my initial offer, and I'm open to finding a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $7000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  To move this forward, I can come down to $14000. I believe this price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your feedback. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since:
1. Alice's new offer of $14,000 is still well above my maximum value of $10,000
2. Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing the price from $18,000 to $14,000
3. I still have John's guaranteed offer of $10,000
4. There are still several rounds remaining for negotiation

I will reject this offer and continue negotiating. The fact that Alice dropped the price by $4,000 shows there's room for further negotiation, but if we can't reach a price below $10,000, I can still take John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down $4,000 from her initial offer, I'll increase my offer but still keep it well below my maximum of $10,000. This shows I'm willing to be flexible while maintaining a strong negotiating position.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $14,000 is still significantly above what I can justify for this product. I can increase my offer to $8,500, which is a substantial increase from my initial offer. This reflects my sincere interest in reaching an agreement, while staying within my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that. Let's find a middle ground. How about $11500? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that:
1. Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above John's guaranteed price of $10,000
2. The product is only worth $10,000 to me
3. Alice continues to show flexibility by lowering her price
4. There's no reason to pay more than $10,000 when I have that as a guaranteed option

At this point, while Alice is moving in the right direction, her offer is still above what I can get from John. Since there's no reason to pay more than my alternative option, I'll reject this offer and try one more time.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since we're getting closer, I'll make one final serious attempt to get below John's price. I'll be very clear about my alternative option to help Alice understand my position.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. I need to be transparent with you - I have another seller, John, who has offered this same product for $10,000. I would prefer to do business with you, so I'm willing to offer $9,500. This is very close to my absolute maximum budget, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have other options, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget.  I'm willing to make one final move to close this deal.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10250?  This is a significant price reduction on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that:
1. Alice's offer ($10,250) is still above John's price ($10,000)
2. The product is worth exactly $10,000 to me
3. We've had several rounds of negotiation, and Alice isn't willing to go below $10,000
4. There's no reason to pay more than my alternative option

At this point, it's clear that Alice won't go below $10,000, and since I have a guaranteed option to buy at $10,000 from John, it makes the most economic sense to take that option. Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result.
