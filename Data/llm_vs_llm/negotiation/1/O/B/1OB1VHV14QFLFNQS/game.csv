Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product that I believe you will love. I'm selling it for $150. What do you think?,150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While the product looks great, I can actually get the same item from John for $150. To make it worth buying from you instead, I'd need a better price. Would you be willing to sell it for $120? This would give me a reason to choose you over the alternative.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob! I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, I canâ€™t go as low as $120. How about I sell it to you for $130? This way, you still get a better deal than going through John. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,3,
