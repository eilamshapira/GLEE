"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While the product looks great, I can actually get the same item from John for $150. To make it worth buying from you instead, I'd need a better price. Would you be willing to sell it for $120? This would give me a reason to choose you over the alternative. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, I canâ€™t go as low as $120. How about I sell it to you for $130? This way, you still get a better deal than going through John. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}"
