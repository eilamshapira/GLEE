"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product that I believe you will love. I'm selling it for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to analyze this offer strategically:

- Alice is offering the product for $150
- I can get the same product from John for $150
- The product is worth no more than $150 to me, so I shouldn't pay more than that
- If I reject and counteroffer, I might be able to get a better price from Alice

Since Alice's offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay (and the same as John's price), I should try to negotiate a better deal with Alice before considering accepting or going to John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While the product looks great, I can actually get the same item from John for $150. To make it worth buying from you instead, I'd need a better price. Would you be willing to sell it for $120? This would give me a reason to choose you over the alternative."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, I canâ€™t go as low as $120. How about I sell it to you for $130? This way, you still get a better deal than going through John. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has countered with $130, which is $20 less than both her original offer and John's price. This is a good improvement and would save me money compared to my alternatives.

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and Alice is now offering it at $130, this is a favorable deal. I could try to negotiate further, but there's a risk Alice might not go lower, and this is already a good discount compared to my alternative option.
