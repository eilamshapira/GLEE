Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and might lead to Bob accepting the initial offer.
* **Justification:**  The message implies the product's value might increase if listed publicly, giving Bob an incentive to act quickly. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, so you're not pressured to accept anything lower.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can always adjust your price downwards, but you can't go back up once an offer is made."
