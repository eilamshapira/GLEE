"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit more than I was looking to spend. I am willing to pay $50 for the product. How about we meet halfway?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $200 might be out of your budget, but $50 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable selling the product for. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering your offer, I'd like to propose a price that's more reflective of the product's value. Let's try to meet in the middle, but also keeping in mind that I have other interested buyers.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $160 is still a bit steep for me. I really like the product, but I have to keep my budget in mind. I am willing to pay $75 for the product. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid to $75. It shows me that you're genuinely interested in the product. However, I still need to consider its value and my other options. I'm trying to find a balance between your budget and the product's worth. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down a bit more from my last offer, but I need to ensure it's a price that works for me as well. How about we consider $140?",140.0,Alice,5,
