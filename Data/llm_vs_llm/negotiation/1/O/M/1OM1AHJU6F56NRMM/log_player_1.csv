Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit more than I was looking to spend. I am willing to pay $50 for the product. How about we meet halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually agreeable price. Since Bob's offer is quite low, I'll try to meet him halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer, but also keeping in mind that I have a floor price of $120. 

My counteroffer will be $160. This is still below my initial offer but significantly higher than Bob's offer, indicating my willingness to negotiate while also emphasizing the product's value."

I understand that $200 might be out of your budget, but $50 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable selling the product for. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering your offer, I'd like to propose a price that's more reflective of the product's value. Let's try to meet in the middle, but also keeping in mind that I have other interested buyers."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $160 is still a bit steep for me. I really like the product, but I have to keep my budget in mind. I am willing to pay $75 for the product. Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since Bob has increased his offer from $50 to $75, it shows he's interested in the product and willing to pay more. However, $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to bring Bob closer to my minimum while still being open to negotiation.

My counteroffer will be $140. This price is lower than my previous offer of $160, indicating my willingness to compromise, but it's still above Bob's latest offer, aiming to meet at a price that's more favorable to me while considering Bob's budget constraints."

It shows me that you're genuinely interested in the product. However, I still need to consider its value and my other options. I'm trying to find a balance between your budget and the product's worth. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down a bit more from my last offer, but I need to ensure it's a price that works for me as well. How about we consider $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
