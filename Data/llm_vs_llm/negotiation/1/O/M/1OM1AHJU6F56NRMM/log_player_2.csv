"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a price that I think reflects its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if Alice is willing to lower her price. The product price that Alice suggested is $100 above the value that I am willing to pay for the product."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $200 might be out of your budget, but $50 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable selling the product for. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering your offer, I'd like to propose a price that's more reflective of the product's value. Let's try to meet in the middle, but also keeping in mind that I have other interested buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's counteroffer is still quite high. Let's see if she's willing to come down further. I will send her an offer for $75."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid to $75. It shows me that you're genuinely interested in the product. However, I still need to consider its value and my other options. I'm trying to find a balance between your budget and the product's worth. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down a bit more from my last offer, but I need to ensure it's a price that works for me as well. How about we consider $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is still too high, and I don't think we'll be able to reach an agreement that's within my budget. It's better to buy the product from John for $100."
