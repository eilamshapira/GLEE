"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I'm willing to sell it for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me think about this situation. Alice is offering the product for $120, but I know that the product is only worth at most $80 to me. Additionally, I can definitely get the product from John for $80.

Since Alice's offer of $120 is above my maximum value ($80) and also above my guaranteed alternative option (buying from John at $80), it makes no sense to accept her offer.

I could reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, but why negotiate when I already have a sure option at my maximum value point?
