"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me and Alice is offering it for $900,000, I should not accept her offer. I have the option to buy from John for $800,000, which matches the maximum value of the product to me. Alternatively, I could reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, but there's no guarantee she would accept a price below $800,000 since the product is worth $800,000 to her.

The most rational decision is:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
