Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to spend no more than $100, I'll offer a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to leave room for negotiation.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's new offer of $100 is exactly at my budget limit and matches the price that John is offering, I don't see any advantage in continuing to negotiate with Alice. Given that I can get the product for the same price from John without the hassle of further negotiation, I will choose to buy the product from John.
