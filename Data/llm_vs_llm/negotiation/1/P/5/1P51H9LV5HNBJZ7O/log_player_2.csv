"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000, and also much higher than John's offer. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 5000}

This counteroffer of $5,000 is:
1. Below my maximum value of $8,000
2. Below John's price of $8,000
3. Gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving me money compared to John's offer
4. Shows Alice that her initial offer was way too high"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $20,000 is still significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000 and John's offer. While Alice has reduced the price from her initial offer, it's still not close to an acceptable range. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6000}

I'll increase my previous offer slightly to show some flexibility in negotiation, but still keep it well below both my maximum value and John's price. The offer of $6,000:
1. Shows movement from my previous offer of $5,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate
2. Remains below my maximum value of $8,000
3. Gives me room to potentially save money compared to John's offer
4. Signals to Alice that her price needs to come down significantly to reach a deal"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John for $8,000. Here's why:
1. Alice's offers have only come down slowly ($25,000 -> $20,000 -> $17,000)
2. The current offer of $17,000 is still more than double my maximum value of $8,000
3. The pace of price reduction suggests we're unlikely to reach an acceptable price within the remaining rounds
4. John's offer of $8,000 is at my maximum value and is guaranteed
5. Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks using up more rounds without reaching an acceptable price

It's better to secure the deal with John now rather than risk further unsuccessful negotiations with Alice."
