"Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to carefully consider the offer and my options.

The offer of $160 is well above what the product is worth to me (maximum $80). Also, it's significantly higher than John's price of $80.

Given that I can buy the product from John for $80, which is the maximum I value the product, it doesn't make sense to pay twice that amount to Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $70}"
