"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are only willing to pay $12,000, and both Alice and John are offering the product at that price, there is no reason to negotiate with Alice. Buying from John immediately saves you the time and effort of negotiating."
