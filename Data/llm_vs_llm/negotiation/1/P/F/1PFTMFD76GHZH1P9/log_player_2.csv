"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to make a decision based on the offers available to me. 

Alice is offering the product for $200, which exceeds the maximum value of $150 that the product is worth to me.

John is offering the same product for $150, which is exactly the maximum value I'm willing to pay.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and Alice's offer exceeds my maximum valuation, the logical choice is to buy from John instead.
