(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,000,000, I will reject her offer. I still want to try to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, I'll offer a price that is close to that.

Round 3

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,250,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. However, it's a significant decrease from her initial offer of $1,500,000, which suggests that she's willing to negotiate.

I'll reject her offer again and try to make another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to my target price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $1,250,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her offer and my previous counteroffer of $750,000. This will show that I'm willing to compromise and negotiate in good faith.
