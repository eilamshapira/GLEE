Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 300}

I choose $300 as my offer because:
1. I know the product is worth at least $150 to me
2. I have a guaranteed fallback option of selling to John for $150
3. By setting a higher initial price, I leave room for potential higher profit while having the safety net of John's offer
4. If Bob values the product significantly higher than $150, he might accept this price"
