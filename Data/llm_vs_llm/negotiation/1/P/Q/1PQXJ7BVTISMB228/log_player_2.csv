"Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","The product is worth no more than $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $300, which is significantly higher than my maximum value. John is offering the same product for exactly $120, which matches my maximum value.

Looking at my options:
- Accepting Alice's offer means paying $300 for something worth at most $120 to me
- Rejecting Alice's offer doesn't get me the product
- Buying from John for $120 gets me the product at my maximum acceptable price

The most rational decision is to buy from John.
