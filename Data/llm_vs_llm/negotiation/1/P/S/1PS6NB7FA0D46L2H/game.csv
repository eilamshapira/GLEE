"Hello Bob, I have a quality product that I'd like to offer you. This product is top-of-the-line and I'm confident it will meet your needs perfectly. I'm offering it to you for $20000. This is an excellent value considering the product's features and benefits. I look forward to your response.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, your asking price of $20000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and I have another seller (John) who is willing to sell me the same product for exactly that amount. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $7500 for the product, which would save me money compared to my alternative option while still providing you with a sale. Let me know if this works for you.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I can't accept $7500 as it's below my minimum threshold. The product has exceptional quality and features that justify a higher price point. While I appreciate your mention of another seller, I'm confident in the superior value of my product. I can come down to $16000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This price reflects both the true value of the product and my desire to work with you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price to $16000, which shows you're willing to negotiate. However, I need to be clear that this product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and I have a guaranteed option to purchase it at that price from another seller. While you may believe your product offers superior value, I cannot justify paying more than what it's worth to me. I'm willing to offer $8500, which is a fair price that still gives you a better deal than I could find elsewhere while staying within my budget constraints. If we can't reach an agreement close to this range, I'll unfortunately need to pursue my alternative option.",8500.0,Bob,4,
