Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, your asking price of $20000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and I have another seller (John) who is willing to sell me the same product for exactly that amount. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $7500 for the product, which would save me money compared to my alternative option while still providing you with a sale. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I can't accept $7,500 as it's below my minimum threshold. The product has exceptional quality and features that justify a higher price point. While I appreciate your mention of another seller, I'm confident in the superior value of my product. I can come down to $16,000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This price reflects both the true value of the product and my desire to work with you."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price to $16000, which shows you're willing to negotiate. However, I need to be clear that this product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and I have a guaranteed option to purchase it at that price from another seller. While you may believe your product offers superior value, I cannot justify paying more than what it's worth to me. I'm willing to offer $8500, which is a fair price that still gives you a better deal than I could find elsewhere while staying within my budget constraints. If we can't reach an agreement close to this range, I'll unfortunately need to pursue my alternative option.
