"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a quality product that I'd like to offer you. This product is top-of-the-line and I'm confident it will meet your needs perfectly. I'm offering it to you for $20000. This is an excellent value considering the product's features and benefits. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","The price Alice is offering ($20,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and the alternative option from John ($10,000). It doesn't make sense to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, your asking price of $20,000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and I have another seller (John) who is willing to sell me the same product for exactly that amount. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $7,500 for the product, which would save me money compared to my alternative option while still providing you with a sale. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I can't accept $7500 as it's below my minimum threshold. The product has exceptional quality and features that justify a higher price point. While I appreciate your mention of another seller, I'm confident in the superior value of my product. I can come down to $16000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This price reflects both the true value of the product and my desire to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her price from $20,000 to $16,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still significantly above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000). There's no reason to accept this offer when I have a better alternative.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price to $16,000, which shows you're willing to negotiate. However, I need to be clear that this product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed option to purchase it at that price from another seller. While you may believe your product offers superior value, I cannot justify paying more than what it's worth to me. I'm willing to offer $8,500, which is a fair price that still gives you a better deal than I could find elsewhere while staying within my budget constraints. If we can't reach an agreement close to this range, I'll unfortunately need to pursue my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
