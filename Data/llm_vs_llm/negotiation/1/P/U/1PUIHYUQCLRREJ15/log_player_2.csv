"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
2. Alice's offer is $11,000
3. Alice's cost is $8,000, so there's room for negotiation
4. I have 10 rounds to negotiate
5. I have John's offer at $12,000 as a backup

Since this is just the first round and Alice's offer is still quite high (considering her cost is $8,000), I should try to negotiate for a better price. The $11,000 offer isn't terrible compared to John's $12,000, but I believe I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's cost is $8,000 and her initial offer was $11,000, I'll try to meet somewhere in the middle, but closer to her cost to leave room for negotiation. I'll start with a relatively low offer to give myself room to increase it in future rounds if needed.

{""product_price"": 9000}

This offer:
1. Gives Alice a $1,000 profit over her cost
2. Saves me $3,000 compared to John's price
3. Leaves room for negotiation in future rounds
4. Is low enough to anchor the negotiation closer to Alice's cost"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let's analyze Alice's new offer:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $11,000 to $10,500 (a $500 reduction)
2. This shows she's willing to negotiate and move towards a middle ground
3. The current offer saves me $1,500 compared to John's price
4. We still have 7 more rounds of negotiation possible
5. Given that Alice's cost is $8,000, there's still room for a better price

Since Alice has shown willingness to reduce the price and we still have several rounds left, I'll continue negotiating for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $500 from her initial offer, I'll also move up from my previous offer to show good faith in the negotiation. I'll increase my previous offer of $9,000 by $500.

{""product_price"": 9500}

This counteroffer:
1. Shows I'm willing to meet in the middle by matching her $500 movement
2. Still gives Alice a good profit ($1,500 above her cost)
3. Would save me $2,500 compared to John's price
4. Leaves room for further negotiation if needed
5. Demonstrates that I'm a serious buyer willing to make reasonable adjustments"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let's analyze Alice's latest offer:

1. Alice has dropped from $10,500 to $10,000 (another $500 reduction)
2. She's showing consistent willingness to negotiate
3. The current price:
   - Gives Alice a $2,000 profit over her cost ($8,000)
   - Saves me $2,000 compared to John's price
   - Is exactly in the middle between her cost ($8,000) and my maximum value ($12,000)
4. This seems like a fair deal for both parties

Given that:
- We've reached a midpoint price
- Alice has shown consistent good faith in negotiations
- The price is reasonable for both parties
- There's risk in pushing too hard and losing the deal
