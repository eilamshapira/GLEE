"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,500,000 is significantly above my maximum value of $1,000,000. It's even higher than Alice's own valuation of $1,200,000. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, as there's clearly room for negotiation. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I always have the option to buy from John at $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 900000}

I'll offer $900,000, which is below both Alice's valuation ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,000,000). This gives room for negotiation while still being a reasonable starting point. If Alice accepts, I'll save $100,000 compared to John's price. If she counters, we can potentially find a middle ground that works for both of us, while I still have John's offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,350,000 is still significantly above my maximum value of $1,000,000 and also above John's guaranteed price of $1,000,000. While Alice has reduced her price from the initial $1,500,000, it's still not a competitive offer. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, as there might still be room for negotiation. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement soon, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 950000}

I'll increase my offer to $950,000, which shows some movement from my previous offer of $900,000. This price is still below John's price of $1,000,000, giving me potential savings if Alice accepts. It's also still below Alice's valuation of $1,200,000, so there could be room for her to make a profit. If she doesn't accept, I still have several rounds to negotiate or ultimately go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($1,300,000) is still significantly above my maximum value ($1,000,000)
2. While Alice has been lowering her price, the decrements are small ($1,500k → $1,350k → $1,300k)
3. Given this pattern, it's unlikely Alice will drop her price below John's $1,000,000 in the remaining rounds
4. John's price ($1,000,000) exactly matches my maximum value
5. Continuing negotiations with Alice would just waste time when I have a guaranteed acceptable price from John

Therefore, it's most rational to end the negotiation and take John's offer now."
