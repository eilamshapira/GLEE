"Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, I must decline as the product is worth at least $1200000 to me. I can see you're looking for value, so I'm willing to reduce my initial price. My counteroffer is $1350000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents great value for a product of this caliber. I hope we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
