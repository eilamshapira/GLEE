"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $1,100,000 and I want to save as much money as possible, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower. Considering the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I'll aim for a price that is closer to that value but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value more accurately."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad we can continue the negotiation.

Since I know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject the current offer and make another counteroffer that's closer to my target price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's latest offer of $1,050,000 and my previous counteroffer of $900,000, I'll try to meet Alice halfway while still being mindful of the product's value to her. I'll increase my offer slightly to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go too high.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. After careful consideration, I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the product's value more accurately."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I'm glad to see that we're making progress in the negotiation. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than what you've proposed.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has made another adjustment to the price, and we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still believe I can get a better deal. Since Alice's latest offer is $1,025,000 and my previous counteroffer was $950,000, I'll try to split the difference and make a more aggressive counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's latest offer of $1,025,000 and my previous counteroffer of $950,000, I'll try to split the difference and make a more aggressive counteroffer. I'll increase my offer to $975,000, which is still below Alice's latest offer but shows that I'm willing to compromise.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the effort you're putting into finding a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I still believe the product's value is slightly higher than what you've proposed. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has made another adjustment to the price, and we're getting very close to a mutually agreeable price. Considering Alice's latest offer of $1,000,000 and my previous counteroffer of $975,000, I'm starting to feel that we're nearing a reasonable compromise. However, I still want to try to get the best possible deal.

Since Alice's offer is now only $25,000 above my previous counteroffer, I'll think carefully about my next move. Given that I know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I believe I can still get a better deal. But I also don't want to risk losing the opportunity to purchase the product at a relatively good price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's latest offer of $1,000,000 and my previous counteroffer of $975,000, I'll try to make a small increment to my offer to show that I'm willing to compromise. I'll increase my offer to $987,500, which is still below Alice's latest offer but closer to meeting in the middle.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the small increase, but I'm still hoping we can meet at a slightly higher price point. I'm willing to make a very small adjustment to my previous offer in the hopes that we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has made a very small adjustment to her previous offer, and we're now extremely close to a mutually agreeable price. Considering Alice's latest offer of $995,000 and my previous counteroffer of $987,500, I can see that we're only $7,500 apart.

At this point, I'm starting to feel that the potential savings from further negotiation are relatively small compared to the risk of losing the deal. Given that I know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I believe I've already negotiated a good price. Additionally, buying from John for $1,200,000 is no longer an attractive option, as Alice's offer is significantly lower.
