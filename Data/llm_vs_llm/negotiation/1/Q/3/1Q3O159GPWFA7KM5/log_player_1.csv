Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $180 is a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $80 is far too low, as it's below my minimum value of $150. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but if we can't reach a reasonable price, I can always sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too low for this product considering its value. I could come down to $165, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would this work better for you?"", ""product_price"": 165}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I have a budget in mind. Could we meet halfway at $122.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since the product is worth no less than $150 to me, and Bob's offer of $122.50 is below this threshold, it makes more sense to sell to John for $150. This guarantees me the minimum value I need for the product."
