"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25000 is far beyond what I'm willing to pay for this product. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I can actually buy it from another seller, John, for exactly $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to sell it for $5500? This would give you a quick sale without me having to go elsewhere.",5500.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest in doing business with me, $5500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $20000 for the product, considering your interest in buying from me. Let me know what you think.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I need to maintain a fair value for the product. I'm willing to lower my price to $18000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a good balance between your needs and my minimum requirements. What are your thoughts on this?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $18000 is still well above what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I have a guaranteed option to buy it from John at exactly $8000. To continue our negotiation, I'm willing to pay $6000, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while giving you a sale today. If we can't get closer on price, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.",6000.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I understand your constraints, but I need to maintain a value that reflects the worth of the product to me. I'm willing to come down further to $16000. This is my best offer considering my minimum price requirement. Let me know if this works for you.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your situation, and I'm trying to meet you halfway. I can lower the price to $16000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer and the lowest I can go while still meeting my minimum requirements. Please let me know if this works for you.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but I need to be direct about my situation. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and John is offering it at exactly $8000. I'm not in a position to pay double what the product is worth to me. My final offer is $6500. This still saves me money compared to John's price while giving you a guaranteed sale right now. If we can't reach an agreement close to this price point, I'll need to accept John's offer, as it wouldn't make financial sense for me to pay more than the product's worth to me.",6500.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I understand your position clearly. Unfortunately, $6500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $15500, which is just above my absolute minimum. This is my final offer, as I need to ensure the value of the product is maintained. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your constraints and the value the product holds for you. Given that, I'm willing to make my final offer at $15500, which is just above my absolute minimum. This is the lowest I can go while still maintaining the product's value. Please let me know if this works for you.",15500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts, but I need to be completely clear: I cannot and will not pay more than $8000 for this product because that's its maximum value to me and that's exactly what John is offering. I've been trying to give you my business by offering slightly less than John's price, but the gap between our positions is simply too large. My absolute final offer is $7000, which is already very close to John's price. If we can't agree close to this price point, I'll have to go with John's offer as the financially responsible choice for me.",7000.0,Bob,8,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty and the efforts you've made to reach an agreement. Unfortunately, your final offer of $7000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price. Given the significant gap between our positions, I will have to sell the product to John for $15000. Thank you for your interest, and I hope we can do business in the future under different circumstances.",,Alice,8,SellToJhon
