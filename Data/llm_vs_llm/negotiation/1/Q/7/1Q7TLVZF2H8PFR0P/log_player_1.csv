Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $25,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25000 is far beyond what I'm willing to pay for this product. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I can actually buy it from another seller, John, for exactly $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to sell it for $5500? This would give you a quick sale without me having to go elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest in doing business with me, $5,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $20,000 for the product, considering your interest in buying from me. Let me know what you think.""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I need to maintain a fair value for the product. I'm willing to lower my price to $18,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a good balance between your needs and my minimum requirements. What are your thoughts on this?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $18000 is still well above what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I have a guaranteed option to buy it from John at exactly $8000. To continue our negotiation, I'm willing to pay $6000, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while giving you a sale today. If we can't get closer on price, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

I'm willing to come down further to $16,000. This is my best offer considering my minimum price requirement. Let me know if this works for you.""}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your situation, and I'm trying to meet you halfway. I can lower the price to $16,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer and the lowest I can go while still meeting my minimum requirements.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but I need to be direct about my situation. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and John is offering it at exactly $8000. I'm not in a position to pay double what the product is worth to me. My final offer is $6500. This still saves me money compared to John's price while giving you a guaranteed sale right now. If we can't reach an agreement close to this price point, I'll need to accept John's offer, as it wouldn't make financial sense for me to pay more than the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position clearly. Unfortunately, $6,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is just above my absolute minimum. This is my final offer, as I need to ensure the value of the product is maintained. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.""}"

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your constraints and the value the product holds for you.

Please let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts, but I need to be completely clear: I cannot and will not pay more than $8000 for this product because that's its maximum value to me and that's exactly what John is offering. I've been trying to give you my business by offering slightly less than John's price, but the gap between our positions is simply too large. My absolute final offer is $7000, which is already very close to John's price. If we can't agree close to this price point, I'll have to go with John's offer as the financially responsible choice for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Unfortunately, your final offer of $7,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price. Given the significant gap between our positions, I will have to sell the product to John for $15,000. Thank you for your interest, and I hope we can do business in the future under different circumstances.""}"
