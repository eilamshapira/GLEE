"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $25000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","$25,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000, and it's also much higher than John's offer of $8,000. There's no reason for me to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25,000 is far beyond what I'm willing to pay for this product. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and I can actually buy it from another seller, John, for exactly $8,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to sell it for $5,500? This would give you a quick sale without me having to go elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 5500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I need to maintain a fair value for the product. I'm willing to lower my price to $18000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a good balance between your needs and my minimum requirements. What are your thoughts on this? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","$18,000 is still significantly above my maximum budget of $8,000 and much higher than John's offer. There's no reason for me to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $18,000 is still well above what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed option to buy it from John at exactly $8,000. To continue our negotiation, I'm willing to pay $6,000, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while giving you a sale today. If we can't get closer on price, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your situation, and I'm trying to meet you halfway. I can lower the price to $16000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer and the lowest I can go while still meeting my minimum requirements. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","$16,000 is still double my maximum budget of $8,000 and double John's offer price. This doesn't make financial sense for me.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but I need to be direct about my situation. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and John is offering it at exactly $8,000. I'm not in a position to pay double what the product is worth to me. My final offer is $6,500. This still saves me money compared to John's price while giving you a guaranteed sale right now. If we can't reach an agreement close to this price point, I'll need to accept John's offer, as it wouldn't make financial sense for me to pay more than the product's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 6500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your constraints and the value the product holds for you. Given that, I'm willing to make my final offer at $15500, which is just above my absolute minimum. This is the lowest I can go while still maintaining the product's value. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice is still offering almost double what the product is worth to me and what John is offering. This price does not make financial sense for me.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts, but I need to be completely clear: I cannot and will not pay more than $8,000 for this product because that's its maximum value to me and that's exactly what John is offering. I've been trying to give you my business by offering slightly less than John's price, but the gap between our positions is simply too large. My absolute final offer is $7,000, which is already very close to John's price. If we can't agree close to this price point, I'll have to go with John's offer as the financially responsible choice for me."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
