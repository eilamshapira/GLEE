"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $150 because:
1. It's higher than my maximum value ($120)
2. It's higher than John's guaranteed price ($120)
3. I can make a counteroffer in the next round to try getting a better deal than both options"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

I'll offer $90 because:
1. It's well below my maximum value ($120)
2. It's significantly lower than John's price ($120), giving me room to negotiate upward if needed
3. It gives Alice room to counter between $90 and $120
4. Even if Alice rejects this offer, we have several more rounds to negotiate, and I can gradually increase my offer if necessary
5. Starting with a lower offer gives me more negotiating leverage"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $115 because:
1. It's below my maximum value ($120)
2. It's better than John's price ($120), saving me $5
3. It's a reasonable compromise from Alice's initial offer of $150
4. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might increase the price again, and I might end up having to pay more or resort to John's higher price"
