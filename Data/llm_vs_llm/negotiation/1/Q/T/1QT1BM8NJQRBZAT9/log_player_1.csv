Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique qualities and value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  Let me know if you're interested, as this is a limited-time offer."", ""product_price"": 19000} 
 
**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price in negotiations. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response will give you valuable information. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he negotiates, you can work towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, so there's no risk of losing out completely. This allows you to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob."
