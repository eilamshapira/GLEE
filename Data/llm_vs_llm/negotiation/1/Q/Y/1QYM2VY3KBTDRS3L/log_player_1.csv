Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I believe $11,500 is a good starting point since it leaves $500 for Bob to potentially make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $11,500.  I'll counter with a price that's more favorable to me in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $11,000.  This is a compromise between my original offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a price that's fair for both of us."
