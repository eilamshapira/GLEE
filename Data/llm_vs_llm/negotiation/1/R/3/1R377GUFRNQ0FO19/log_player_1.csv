{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","This is where it gets interesting! $10,000 is a good profit, but I don't know how much more Bob is willing to pay. I also don't want to push too hard and risk losing the sale entirely. I have 8 more rounds and a safety net of $8,000.

Let's try to push for a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 3
