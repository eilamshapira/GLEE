"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer is the same as John's price ($15,000), and I want to save as much money as possible, I should try to negotiate with Alice for a better price. I still have 9 more rounds to negotiate, and I can always fall back to John's offer if negotiations with Alice don't work out.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low that it would be considered unreasonable.

{""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has significantly lowered her price from $15,000 to $12,000, which is a good sign. This is already $3,000 less than John's price. While we might be able to negotiate further, this is already a substantial savings, and there's a risk that Alice might increase her price if we continue negotiating. I'll take this offer.
