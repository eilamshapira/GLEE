Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, I need to make a decision. Accepting Bob's offer would result in a loss, and my minimum is $150. Selling to John gives me $150, which is my minimum acceptable price.

Therefore, I will choose to sell to John.
