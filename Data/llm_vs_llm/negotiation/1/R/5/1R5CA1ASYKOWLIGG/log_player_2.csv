"Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is only worth $80 to me and Alice's initial offer of $160 is too high, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer.

{""product_price"": 70}

I'm offering $70 because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $80
2. It gives room for negotiation if Alice counters
3. It's significantly lower than her initial offer of $160, but still might be acceptable since the product is worth $150 to her"
