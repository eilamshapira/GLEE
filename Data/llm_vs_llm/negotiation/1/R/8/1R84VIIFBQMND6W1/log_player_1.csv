I will send Bob a counteroffer with a lower price, but not as low as $5,000. Let's try to find a middle ground.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 12000}

This price is lower than the initial offer and shows willingness to negotiate, but it is still higher than the price of selling the product to John. Also, considering the value of the product to me, it would still be a good deal."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is below the amount of selling the product to John, selling to John is more profitable."
