Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. I believe it's a reasonable price considering my budget and the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob, and if not, I have the option to sell to John for $12,000. 

My next offer will be: 
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and I'm open to further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 11500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the reduction in price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I believe it's a reasonable compromise considering my budget and the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:

My next offer will be:
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the continued reduction in price. I'm getting closer to my budget, but I still need a bit more flexibility. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I believe it's a reasonable compromise considering my budget and the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $7,500 is still lower than the product's worth to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. However, I notice that Bob is slowly increasing his offer, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

My next offer will be:
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your continued willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the significant reduction in price. I'm very close to my budget now, but I still need a bit more flexibility. Considering your offer of $9500, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but still within my budget constraints. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I believe it's a reasonable compromise considering my budget and the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is the highest he has offered so far, and it's also the maximum value the product is worth to him, I will accept his offer. Although it's lower than the product's worth to me, I believe it's a reasonable compromise considering the negotiations we've had. Continuing to negotiate may not yield a better result, and selling to John for $12,000 is no longer necessary since I've already invested time and effort into negotiating with Bob."
