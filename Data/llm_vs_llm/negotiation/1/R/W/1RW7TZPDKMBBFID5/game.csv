"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is significantly above my budget. Given current market conditions and my research, I would be willing to pay $700000 for the product. This is a fair offer that still provides you with a good return. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $700000 is below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1100000, considering our previous offer was a bit high. This still represents a significant value for you. What are your thoughts on this?",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
