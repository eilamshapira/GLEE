"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $1200000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer is $1,200,000
2. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
3. John is offering the same product for $800,000
4. Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is way too high - it's $400,000 more than what the product is worth to me and $400,000 more than John's price. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations don't go well, I can always buy from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably lower but still gives room for negotiation:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. Given current market conditions and my research, I would be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair offer that still provides you with a good return. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}

My reasoning:
1. I'm starting with a price below my maximum ($800,000) to leave room for negotiation
2. $700,000 is low enough to potentially anchor the negotiation closer to my target range
3. If Alice rejects this, I still have the option to go to John at $800,000
4. My message is professional and provides justification for the lower price
5. This gives Alice room to counter while still keeping the final price potentially below my maximum value"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value this product brings is substantial. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1050000. This is a significant reduction from our initial offer and reflects our desire to work with you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. Alice has reduced the price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000 (a $150,000 reduction)
2. However, $1,050,000 is still:
   - $250,000 more than my maximum value ($800,000)
   - $250,000 more than John's offer ($800,000)
3. While Alice is showing willingness to negotiate, this price is still too high

At this point, I could continue negotiating, but since:
- The current offer is significantly above my maximum value
- John's offer ($800,000) is already at my maximum acceptable price
- There's no guarantee Alice will come down to $800,000 or below
- We've already used 3 rounds of negotiation

It makes the most sense to go with John's guaranteed offer rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might not reach my target price.
