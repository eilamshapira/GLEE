"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to consider the value of the product to me (maximum $1,000,000) and the two available options for purchasing.

Alice is offering the product for $2,400,000, which exceeds my maximum value for it.
John is offering the same product for $1,000,000, which equals my maximum value.

Since Alice's offer exceeds what the product is worth to me, and John's offer is available at a price that matches my maximum value, the rational choice is clear.
