"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is significantly above my budget. I have other options available at much lower prices. I value the product at $1200000, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, given your budget constraints and the value of the product, we're willing to come down to $1800000. This price reflects a significant discount while still acknowledging the premium quality of our product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for reducing the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I have a firm alternative offer of $1500000 from another seller. For me to consider your offer instead, you would need to beat that price. I can offer $1350000, which would be a win-win for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, after careful consideration, we're willing to make a significant move. We can agree to a price of $1650000. This offer is firm and reflects our best and final price.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
