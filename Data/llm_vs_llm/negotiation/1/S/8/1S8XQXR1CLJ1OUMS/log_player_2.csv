"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm confident that you'll find our asking price of $2500000 quite reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Explanation: Alice's initial offer of $2,500,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's alternative price ($1,500,000). It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer when I know I can get it for $1,500,000 from John. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, starting negotiations at a lower price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I have other options available at much lower prices. I value the product at $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given your budget constraints and the value of the product, we're willing to come down to $1800000. This price reflects a significant discount while still acknowledging the premium quality of our product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Explanation: While Alice has reduced the price significantly from her initial offer, $1,800,000 is still above both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's price ($1,500,000). There's no reason to accept this offer when I can get it for less from John. I'll continue negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a better price, knowing I always have John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for reducing the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I have a firm alternative offer of $1,500,000 from another seller. For me to consider your offer instead, you would need to beat that price. I can offer $1,350,000, which would be a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after careful consideration, we're willing to make a significant move. We can agree to a price of $1650000. This offer is firm and reflects our best and final price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Explanation: Alice's ""best and final"" price of $1,650,000 is still above both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's price ($1,500,000). Since Alice has indicated this is their final price and it's still higher than my alternative, it's time to end the negotiation and accept John's offer. There's no point in continuing negotiations when Alice has made it clear they won't go below $1,650,000, and I have a better option available."
