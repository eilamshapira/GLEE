Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob for the product. 

Given the situation, I need to balance between getting a good price and not risking losing the sale to Bob. Since I can always sell to John for $12,000, I should offer Bob a price that's higher than this floor value.

I'll offer a moderately higher price that gives me some additional profit while still being potentially acceptable to Bob.
