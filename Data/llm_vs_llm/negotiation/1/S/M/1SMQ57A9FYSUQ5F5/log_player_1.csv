"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product and I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a high offer.

You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,500,000, I will not accept Bob's offer.

However, I still want to explore the possibility of getting a better deal from Bob, so I won't sell to John just yet.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $500,000, which is very low, I'll make a counteroffer that is still high, but slightly lower than my initial offer, to show that I'm willing to negotiate.

I'll reject Bob's offer again and try to make another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

However, I'll give it a few more rounds to see if we can get closer to a deal. I'll reject Bob's offer again and try to make another counteroffer.

At this point, I think it's more likely that I can get a better deal from John, who is willing to pay $1,500,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and consider selling to John.

Given that I have the option to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is a guaranteed deal, I think it's the best choice. I'll reject Bob's offer and sell the product to John.
