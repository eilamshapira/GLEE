"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is lower than the minimum value of $12,000 that the product is worth to me, and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer. However, I still want to try to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Therefore, I will proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

My counteroffer is: $14,000

So, my decision is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} and I'll wait for Bob's response to my counteroffer."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,500 is still lower than what I was hoping to get, but closer to my desired price, I will reject Bob's offer again. However, I will also try to be more realistic and consider that Bob's offers are increasing, which might indicate that he is serious about buying the product.

I will proceed to the next round with a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous one, to see if we can meet in the middle.

My counteroffer is: $13,000

So, my decision is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} and I'll wait for Bob's response to my counteroffer."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $11,500 is very close to the price I can get from John ($12,000), and I've been negotiating with Bob for a while, I think it's time to consider accepting an offer that is reasonably close to my target price.

However, I will try to squeeze out a bit more from Bob. I will reject Bob's offer again and make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous one, but still higher than Bob's current offer.

My counteroffer is: $12,200

So, my decision is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} and I'll wait for Bob's response to my counteroffer."
