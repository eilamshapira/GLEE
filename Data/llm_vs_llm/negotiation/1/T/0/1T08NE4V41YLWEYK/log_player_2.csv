"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. If you're interested, please consider my offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is higher than both:
1. My maximum value for the product ($800,000)
2. John's alternative offer ($800,000)

It would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. Since John is offering a guaranteed price of $800,000, which equals my maximum value, the best decision is to buy from John.
