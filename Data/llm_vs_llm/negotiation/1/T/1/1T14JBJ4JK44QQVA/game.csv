"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its market value and features, I'm offering it at $11500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in your product, $11500 seems a bit high for what I'm looking for. Since I know there are similar products available on the market, I'd like to counter with $10500. This gives you a $500 profit margin while still being reasonable for my budget. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I know this product holds significant value, and while I want to work with you, I need to ensure a fair deal. I can come down to $11000, which is a $1500 discount from your potential value of $12000. This represents good savings for you while still being a reasonable price for the quality you're getting.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11000. That's certainly a step in the right direction, but I'm still looking for a better value. I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer $10700 for the product. This gives you a reasonable profit while allowing me to stay comfortably within my budget. What do you say to this compromise?",10700.0,Bob,4,
