"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its market value and features, I'm offering it at $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in your product, $11500 seems a bit high for what I'm looking for. Since I know there are similar products available on the market, I'd like to counter with $10500. This gives you a $500 profit margin while still being reasonable for my budget. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $10,500 is too low considering the product's value to Bob ($12,000). There's still room for negotiation, and I have several rounds left to reach a better deal. Plus, I always have John's $10,000 offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I know this product holds significant value, and while I want to work with you, I need to ensure a fair deal. I can come down to $11,000, which is a $1,500 discount from your potential value of $12,000. This represents good savings for you while still being a reasonable price for the quality you're getting."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11000. That's certainly a step in the right direction, but I'm still looking for a better value. I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer $10700 for the product. This gives you a reasonable profit while allowing me to stay comfortably within my budget. What do you say to this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $10,700. While it's lower than my initial target, it's still a $700 profit over my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Given that we've gone through several rounds of negotiation and Bob seems firm in his price range, this is a reasonable compromise. Continuing to negotiate might risk Bob walking away, leaving me with only John's $10,000 offer. A guaranteed $700 profit is better than risking further negotiations that might not yield significantly better results."
