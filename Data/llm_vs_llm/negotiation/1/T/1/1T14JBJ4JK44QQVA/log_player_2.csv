"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its market value and features, I'm offering it at $11500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she's proposing $11,500 for the product. Since this product is worth at most $12,000 to me, this offer is within my acceptable range. However, I know the product is only worth $10,000 to Alice, which means there's room to negotiate for a better price. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try to save more money.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in your product, $11,500 seems a bit high for what I'm looking for. Since I know there are similar products available on the market, I'd like to counter with $10,500. This gives you a $500 profit margin while still being reasonable for my budget. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I know this product holds significant value, and while I want to work with you, I need to ensure a fair deal. I can come down to $11000, which is a $1500 discount from your potential value of $12000. This represents good savings for you while still being a reasonable price for the quality you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I can see Alice has reduced her price from $11,500 to $11,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is already $1,000 less than my maximum ($12,000), but I know the product is only worth $10,000 to her, so there's still room for a better deal. Since we still have plenty of rounds left and I have John's $12,000 offer as a backup, I'll reject this offer and try to get a better price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000. That's certainly a step in the right direction, but I'm still looking for a better value. I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer $10,700 for the product. This gives you a reasonable profit while allowing me to stay comfortably within my budget. What do you say to this compromise?"", ""product_price"": 10700}"
