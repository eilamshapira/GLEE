"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since both Alice's offer and John's price are $15,000, there's no advantage in buying from either one at this price. However, by rejecting Alice's offer, I have the opportunity to make a counteroffer that might get me a better deal. Therefore, I should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a significantly lower offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be unreasonable. Since my maximum value is $15,000, I'll start at around 60% of that value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced the price significantly from $15,000 to $12,000, which is a good improvement. This offer would save me $3,000 compared to buying from John. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might increase the price again or become unwilling to negotiate. Since $12,000 represents a substantial savings from my maximum price of $15,000, I should accept this offer.
