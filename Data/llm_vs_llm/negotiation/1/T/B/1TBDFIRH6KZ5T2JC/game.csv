"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. John is offering the same product for $800000, which is my maximum budget for this purchase. To give you my business instead, I'd be willing to pay $750000. This gives you a quick sale while allowing me some savings compared to my alternative option.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must decline. While I understand your budget constraints, I need to be transparent - my minimum acceptable price is $800000, which is what John is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I can reduce my initial asking price to $875000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still providing you with a quality product.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, I need to be clear that John is offering the exact same product for $800000, which is already my maximum budget. Since the product is worth no more than $800000 to me, I can't justify paying more than that. I'm willing to pay you $780000 to give you my business instead of John. This is a fair offer considering the alternatives available to me.",780000.0,Bob,4,
