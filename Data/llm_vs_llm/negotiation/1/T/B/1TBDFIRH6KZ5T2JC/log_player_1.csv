"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 950000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. John is offering the same product for $800000, which is my maximum budget for this purchase. To give you my business instead, I'd be willing to pay $750000. This gives you a quick sale while allowing me some savings compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. While Bob mentions John's price of $800,000, I know that's also my minimum acceptable price. Since Bob is willing to negotiate, I'll continue the discussion to try to secure a better deal than my fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must decline. While I understand your budget constraints, I need to be transparent - my minimum acceptable price is $800,000, which is what John is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I can reduce my initial asking price to $875,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still providing you with a quality product."", ""product_price"": 875000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, I need to be clear that John is offering the exact same product for $800000, which is already my maximum budget. Since the product is worth no more than $800000 to me, I can't justify paying more than that. I'm willing to pay you $780000 to give you my business instead of John. This is a fair offer considering the alternatives available to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob has made it clear that he won't pay more than $800,000, and his current offer is still below that. Since John is offering $800,000, which matches my minimum acceptable price, and Bob seems unlikely to match or exceed this amount, it's best to take the guaranteed deal with John rather than continue negotiations that may not yield a better result."
