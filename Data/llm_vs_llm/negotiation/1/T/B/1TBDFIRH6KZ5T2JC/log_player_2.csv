"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's asking for $950,000, which is $150,000 above the maximum I'm willing to pay ($800,000). Since I can buy the same product from John for exactly $800,000, there's no reason for me to accept Alice's current offer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. John is offering the same product for $800,000, which is my maximum budget for this purchase. To give you my business instead, I'd be willing to pay $750,000. This gives you a quick sale while allowing me some savings compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must decline. While I understand your budget constraints, I need to be transparent - my minimum acceptable price is $800000, which is what John is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I can reduce my initial asking price to $875000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still providing you with a quality product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $875,000, which is still $75,000 more than John's price of $800,000. Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and I can get it from John for exactly that price, there's no reason for me to accept Alice's current offer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, I need to be clear that John is offering the exact same product for $800,000, which is already my maximum budget. Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, I can't justify paying more than that. I'm willing to pay you $780,000 to give you my business instead of John. This is a fair offer considering the alternatives available to me."", ""product_price"": 780000}"
