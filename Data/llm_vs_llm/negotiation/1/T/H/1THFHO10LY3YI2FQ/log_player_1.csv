Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will be interested but if not, we can work down from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $8,000. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $12,000.  This is still a fair price for me, and I believe it is more likely to be accepted by Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not sure if we can agree on a higher price with further negotiation.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'll take the $10,000 and sell to him."
