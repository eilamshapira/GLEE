"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $300 is significantly higher than the product's worth to me ($100) and higher than John's price ($100). It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know the product is worth $100 to me and John is willing to sell it for $100, I'll start with a low offer to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 50}

This counteroffer is intentionally low, but it gives room for negotiation while still being potentially profitable for Alice if her cost is low enough. If Alice rejects this, we can gradually work towards a higher price in subsequent rounds, but always keeping in mind that we have the $100 option with John as our fallback."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $275. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $275
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $275 is still significantly higher than both the product's worth to me ($100) and John's price ($100). While Alice has reduced her price from $300 to $275, it's still not competitive with my alternative option. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $300 to $275, showing some willingness to negotiate, I'll increase my previous offer slightly but still keep it well below my maximum value.

{""product_price"": 75}

This offer is a modest increase from my previous $50 offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a good margin below both my maximum value and John's price. If Alice continues to reject, we can either continue negotiating or ultimately go with John's offer of $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice continues to lower her price (from $300 to $275 to $250), it's still significantly above both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). There's no reason to accept this offer when I have a guaranteed option to buy at $100. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has shown a pattern of reducing her price (300 -> 275 -> 250), I'll increase my offer again but stay below John's price.

{""product_price"": 90}

This offer is a significant increase from my previous offers of $50 and $75, showing I'm serious about making a deal. However, it's still below John's price of $100, giving me room to either make one final increase or switch to John's offer if Alice doesn't accept. The offer is also below my maximum value of $100, ensuring I don't lose value in the transaction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $225. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $225
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's clear that Alice's offers, while decreasing (from $300 to $225), are still significantly above John's price of $100. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Alice's prices remain more than twice what John is offering. Since the product is only worth $100 to me, and John is willing to sell at exactly that price, it makes more sense to end the negotiation with Alice and buy from John rather than continue this negotiation which shows no signs of reaching an acceptable price point."
