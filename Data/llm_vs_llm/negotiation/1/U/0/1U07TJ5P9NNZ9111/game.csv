"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking for a better price. How about $8000 for the product?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8000 is below my minimum threshold for this product. The product is worth at least $10000 to me based on its quality and market value. I can come down to $12500, which I believe is a fair compromise from my initial offer. This represents significant value for a product of this caliber.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price. However, I am still looking for a more competitive deal. Would you consider $9500 for the product?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I need to be clear that the product is worth at least $10000 to me. In fact, I have another buyer, John, who is already willing to pay me that amount. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. My final offer is $11000, which I believe is fair considering the product's value. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I will need to proceed with the other buyer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
