"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $9,500
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: $10,000

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and:
- The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
- Alice's offer ($9,500) is less than John's price ($10,000)
- I'll save $500 by accepting Alice's offer compared to buying from John

The rational choice is to accept Alice's offer at $9,500.
