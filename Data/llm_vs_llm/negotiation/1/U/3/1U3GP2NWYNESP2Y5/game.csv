"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $11000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I know the market value of this product, and I can actually get it elsewhere for $8000. However, I'd like to work with you and would offer $7000 for the product. This would allow us to close the deal quickly and benefit both of us.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but this product is valued quite highly. Given that, I'm prepared to offer it to you for $9500, which I believe is a fair compromise for us both.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I have another seller offering this same product for $8000. I would prefer to do business with you, so I'll offer $7500. This is a very fair offer considering the market price, and it would allow us both to benefit from this transaction.",7500.0,Bob,4,
