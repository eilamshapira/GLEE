Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $11000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I know the market value of this product, and I can actually get it elsewhere for $8000. However, I'd like to work with you and would offer $7000 for the product. This would allow us to close the deal quickly and benefit both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
