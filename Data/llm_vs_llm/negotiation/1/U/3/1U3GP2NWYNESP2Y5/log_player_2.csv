"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it will be a fantastic addition for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The initial offer of $11,000 from Alice is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative price ($8,000). It would not be rational to accept this offer, and since I can always fall back on John's offer, I should try negotiating with Alice first to potentially get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still reasonable given that the product is worth $8,000 to her.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $11,000 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I know the market value of this product, and I can actually get it elsewhere for $8,000. However, I'd like to work with you and would offer $7,000 for the product. This would allow us to close the deal quickly and benefit both of us."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but this product is valued quite highly. Given that, I'm prepared to offer it to you for $9500, which I believe is a fair compromise for us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $9,500 is still higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative price ($8,000). Since I can get the product from John for $8,000, there's no reason to accept a price higher than that. However, I'll reject and try one more counter-offer before potentially going to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I have another seller offering this same product for $8,000. I would prefer to do business with you, so I'll offer $7,500. This is a very fair offer considering the market price, and it would allow us both to benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
