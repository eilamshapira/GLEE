"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $2,500,000, I need to make a decision that maximizes my value.

The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $1,500,000.

Alice's offer of $2,500,000 is $1,000,000 more than the product's maximum value to me, and $1,000,000 more than John's offer.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, I should choose the option that gives me the best value.
