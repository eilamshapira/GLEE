"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a good starting point to see if Bob is interested and to see if there's room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price from him.  I'm still early in the negotiation and can afford to take some risks."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counter with $120. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and continue negotiating with him. I'm still early in the process and I don't want to sell for a price that's significantly lower than what I value the product at."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $100. This is a compromise, but I still believe it's a fair price given the value of the product. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous offers, it's still below my minimum price.  I'm going to reject this offer and try for a better price.  I have a few more rounds to go and I can still sell to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a further compromise and hopefully close to what Bob is willing to pay.  I'm running out of rounds, so I'm trying to get a deal done before I have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting close, but I'm running out of time. If I reject Bob's offer, I'm not sure I'll be able to get a higher price from him in the next round.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, so I'm going to take that option."
