"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it for $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $18,000, I need to compare it with my other options. 

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and John is willing to sell the same product for exactly $12,000. Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation and John's price.

There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer, as I would be paying $6,000 more than the product is worth to me. I could make a counteroffer to Alice, but I already know I can get the product from John at my maximum valuation price.
