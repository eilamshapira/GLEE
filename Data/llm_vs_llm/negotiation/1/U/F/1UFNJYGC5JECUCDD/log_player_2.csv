"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $1600000. I believe it will be a great investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what you know John will sell for.  It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way outside my budget.  I'm thinking closer to $600,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Start:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Below Budget:** My offer is well below my $800,000 maximum, giving me space to negotiate up if needed.
* **Direct but Polite:** My message is clear and to the point but maintains a professional and courteous tone."
