Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. However, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $120, which is the highest I'm comfortable paying. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'm ready to make a deal.

Since Bob's offer of $120 is lower than John's offer of $150, and I've already tried to negotiate with Bob, I think it's best to sell the product to John for the higher price."
