"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The offer from Alice is significantly higher than the maximum value I'm willing to pay ($8,000), and it's also much higher than John's alternative offer of $8,000. Since I can get the same product from John at a much lower price that matches my maximum budget, there's no reason for me to accept Alice's high offer.
