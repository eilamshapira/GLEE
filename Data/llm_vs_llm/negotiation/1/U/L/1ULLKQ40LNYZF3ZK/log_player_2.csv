"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's alternative offer ($1,000,000). It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer when I have a better alternative. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, starting negotiations at a lower price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 900000}

Rationale: I'll start with a counteroffer of $900,000 for these reasons:
1. It's below my maximum value of $1,000,000
2. It's below John's alternative offer of $1,000,000
3. While it's significantly below Alice's initial offer of $1,250,000, it's still a substantial amount that might keep her engaged in negotiations
4. It gives room for negotiation to move up while still staying below my maximum threshold
5. Even though I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, starting low gives me room to negotiate up while potentially achieving a better deal than John's offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: Alice's new offer of $1,220,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's alternative offer ($1,000,000). While Alice has moved down from her initial offer, the price is still too high. Since I have John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 as a backup, I can afford to continue negotiating with Alice. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, trying to bring the price closer to a range that works for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 950000}

Rationale: I'll increase my offer to $950,000 for these reasons:
1. It shows movement from my previous offer of $900,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate
2. It's still below my maximum value and John's alternative offer of $1,000,000
3. The $50,000 increase from my last offer is a significant step, showing good faith
4. It maintains a strong negotiating position while still leaving room for potential further negotiation
5. If Alice rejects this, I still have the fallback option of buying from John at $1,000,000
6. By moving up gradually, I'm hoping to signal to Alice that I'm serious about reaching a deal, but not at her current asking price"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Rationale: At this point, I'm choosing to buy from John because:
1. Alice's latest offer ($1,200,000) is still significantly above both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's offer ($1,000,000)
2. While Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate down (from $1,250,000 to $1,200,000), she seems unlikely to drop below her product's worth ($1,200,000)
3. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and the gap between our positions remains too large
4. John's offer of $1,000,000 exactly matches my maximum value
5. Continuing negotiations with Alice seems unlikely to result in a better deal than John's offer
6. There's no reason to waste more time negotiating when I have a guaranteed acceptable offer from John"
