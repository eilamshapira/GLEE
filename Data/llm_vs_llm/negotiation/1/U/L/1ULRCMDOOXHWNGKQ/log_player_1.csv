"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.

{""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","$11,000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and we're only in round 2. Since Bob has shown willingness to negotiate and the product is worth $15,000 to him, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial $14,000, but still maintain a position that gives room for negotiation while trying to secure a good profit.

{""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob has increased his offer from $11,000 to $12,000, showing willingness to move up significantly. This is a decent offer that gives me $2,000 more than John's fixed price. While there might be room to negotiate further, we're already in round 4, and pushing too hard might risk losing this good offer. I'll accept this offer.
