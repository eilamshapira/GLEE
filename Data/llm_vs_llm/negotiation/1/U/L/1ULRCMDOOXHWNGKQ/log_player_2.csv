"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is close to my maximum budget of $15,000, but I still have room to negotiate and potentially save some money, I'll choose to reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's initial offer was $14,000 and my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still reasonable. Since I know the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly above that value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $13,000 is a step in the right direction, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since I know the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, I'm willing to continue negotiating to try to get closer to that price. I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 2, I offered $11,000, which was rejected by Alice. Now, Alice has come down to $13,000. To try to meet in the middle and make progress, I'll increase my offer slightly, but still keep it below Alice's current offer.
