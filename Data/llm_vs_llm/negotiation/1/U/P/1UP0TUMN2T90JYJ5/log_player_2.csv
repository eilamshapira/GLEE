"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. If you're interested, please consider my offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $8,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $10,000
3. John is offering the same product for $8,000

Since Alice's offer ($10,000) is higher than both:
- My maximum value ($8,000)
- John's alternative offer ($8,000)

It would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. Since John's offer matches my maximum value and is available, the best decision would be to buy from John.
