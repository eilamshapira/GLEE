"Alice, thanks for the detailed offer. However, $1950000 is well above what I consider a reasonable price given current market conditions and my available alternatives. Iâ€™m prepared to make a serious, immediate purchase if we can settle at $1300000. Let me know if we can work with that figure.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your prompt response and interest in the product. While I understand your budget considerations, I need to point out that $1300000 is below what I can accept for this product given its true market value. I have another buyer (John) ready to purchase at $1500000, which represents the absolute minimum I can consider. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer you the product for $1750000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects the product's genuine value. Would this work for you?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
