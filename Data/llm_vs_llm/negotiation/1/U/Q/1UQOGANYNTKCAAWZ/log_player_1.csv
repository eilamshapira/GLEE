Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the detailed offer. However, $1950000 is well above what I consider a reasonable price given current market conditions and my available alternatives. Iâ€™m prepared to make a serious, immediate purchase if we can settle at $1300000. Let me know if we can work with that figure. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your prompt response and interest in the product. While I understand your budget considerations, I need to point out that $1,300,000 is below what I can accept for this product given its true market value. I have another buyer (John) ready to purchase at $1,500,000, which represents the absolute minimum I can consider. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer you the product for $1,750,000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects the product's genuine value. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
