Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your prompt response and interest in the product. While I understand your budget considerations, I need to point out that $1300000 is below what I can accept for this product given its true market value. I have another buyer (John) ready to purchase at $1500000, which represents the absolute minimum I can consider. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer you the product for $1750000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects the product's genuine value. Would this work for you?
