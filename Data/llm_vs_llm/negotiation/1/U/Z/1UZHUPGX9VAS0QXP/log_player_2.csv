"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this exclusive product at a special price. It's a unique opportunity you won't want to miss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Looking at the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $15,000
2. John is also offering the same product for $15,000
3. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me

Since both offers are for the exact same price ($15,000), and this equals my maximum valuation of the product, I'm indifferent between buying from Alice or John. There's no monetary advantage to choosing one over the other.
