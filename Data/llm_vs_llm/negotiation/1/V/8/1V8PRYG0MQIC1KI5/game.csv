"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking of a price around $6000. I believe this reflects its value more accurately given my budget and the market.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $6000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $13000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping for something more around $6500. I think this price point would be more aligned with what I'm looking to spend.",6500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our offers is still significant.  I'm willing to drop to $11000, as this is the absolute lowest I can go. This offer reflects the true value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $11000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7000. I believe this is a fair middle ground for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, taking anything less than $10000 would be selling myself short.  How about we meet in the middle - $10500 and we have a deal?",10500.0,Alice,7,
