"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $10,000, reject it and make a counteroffer, or buy from John for $12,000.

The product is worth at most $12,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $10,000, which is $2,000 less than John's price. This is a reasonable offer, but since the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice, I can try to negotiate a better price.

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. There are still 9 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's better than Alice's cost but still gives me good savings compared to John's price.

{""product_price"": $8,800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price from $10,000 to $9,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is a better offer, but still significantly above her cost of $8,000. I have 7 more rounds left after this one, so I can continue negotiating to try to get a better price.

The current offer of $9,500 is $2,500 less than John's price, which is a good savings, but I believe I can still get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still aim for a price that gives both of us reasonable value.

{""product_price"": $9,000}"
