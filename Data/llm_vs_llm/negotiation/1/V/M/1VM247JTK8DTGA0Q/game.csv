"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. Based on my budget constraints and the market alternatives, I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. I believe this is a fair start, and I'd like to see if we can adjust to meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $1000000 is below the product's value to me. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure I'm receiving fair value. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer - I can sell the product to you for $1500000. This represents a significant reduction from my first offer while still reflecting the product's true market value.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
