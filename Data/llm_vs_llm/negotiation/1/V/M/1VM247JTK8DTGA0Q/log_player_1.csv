Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $1,000,000 is below the product's value to me.

This represents a significant reduction from my first offer while still reflecting the product's true market value."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
