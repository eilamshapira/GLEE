"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I believe it will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:
1. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
2. John is offering it for $120 (my fallback option)
3. Alice's offer is $110, which is lower than John's price
4. However, since this is just the first round and the product is worth $80 to Alice, I can try to negotiate for a better price

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, as there's room for negotiation to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably above Alice's cost ($80) but significantly lower than her initial offer ($110), giving room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe $110 is a bit high. Given the market conditions, I can offer $90 for the product. This would still give you a good profit margin while being a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, the value of this product is considerably higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to come down to $100, which I believe is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the updated situation:
1. Alice has reduced her price from $110 to $100
2. This shows she's willing to negotiate and has made a significant move ($10 reduction)
3. $100 is still $20 better than John's price of $120
4. While we might get a slightly better price by continuing to negotiate, there's also a risk of Alice becoming less flexible
5. $100 is a reasonable price, giving me $20 in savings compared to my alternative

Given that Alice has made a substantial concession and we've reached a price point that gives me good savings, I'll accept this offer.
