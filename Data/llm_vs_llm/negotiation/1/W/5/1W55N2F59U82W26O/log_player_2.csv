"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm willing to sell it for $1400000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to evaluate this offer carefully:

- Alice is offering the product for $1,400,000
- The product is worth at most $1,200,000 to me
- John (not Jhon) is willing to sell me the same product for $1,200,000

Since Alice's offer ($1,400,000) exceeds the product's worth to me ($1,200,000), and I have another option to buy it at exactly $1,200,000 from John, the economical choice is clear.
