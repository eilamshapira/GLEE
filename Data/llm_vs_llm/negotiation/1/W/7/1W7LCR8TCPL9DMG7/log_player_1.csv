Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $145 is a bit high for me. Given market prices, I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. This would still give you a good profit margin while being a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
