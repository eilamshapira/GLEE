"Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I'm looking to sell. I believe it's an excellent opportunity, and I'm offering it to you first. Given my analysis of the market and the product's value, I'm asking for $1050000. This is a competitive price considering the product's potential. However, I should note that I already have another interested buyer, John, who has offered $1000000. I wanted to give you the opportunity to consider it before finalizing with him. Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
