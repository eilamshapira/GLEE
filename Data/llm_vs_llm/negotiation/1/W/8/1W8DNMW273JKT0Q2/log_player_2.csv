"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I'm looking to sell. I believe it's an excellent opportunity, and I'm offering it to you first. Given my analysis of the market and the product's value, I'm asking for $1050000. This is a competitive price considering the product's potential. However, I should note that I already have another interested buyer, John, who has offered $1000000. I wanted to give you the opportunity to consider it before finalizing with him. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Analyzing this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me (Bob).
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $1,050,000.
3. I can buy the same product from John for $800,000.

Alice's offer exceeds both my maximum valuation ($800,000) and the available alternative from John ($800,000). There's no reason for me to accept Alice's offer.
