"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product and I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a high offer. 

{""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and also lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,500,000), I will reject Bob's offer. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safer option, but I still want to try to negotiate a better price with Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $600,000, which is quite low, I'll make a counteroffer that is still high but slightly lower than my initial offer to show that I'm willing to negotiate. 

{""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $650,000 is still significantly lower than my counteroffer and also lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,500,000). However, it's a slight increase from his previous offer, which suggests that he's willing to negotiate. I'll reject his offer again and try to find a middle ground.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer is still quite low, I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than my previous one, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'll try to bring the price down gradually to see if we can meet in the middle.

{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $700,000 is still lower than my desired price, but it's getting closer to the minimum value I have for the product ($1,500,000). However, it's still more than half a million dollars short of that minimum. I'm starting to think that Bob may not be willing to pay a price that's close to the product's value, so I'm considering selling to John. But I'll give Bob one more chance to increase his offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer is still quite low, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than my previous one, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'll try to make a more reasonable offer to see if we can reach an agreement.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $750,000 is still lower than my counteroffer and the minimum value I have for the product ($1,500,000). At this point, I've made a reasonable offer of $1,500,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and Bob is still not meeting me at that price. With only two rounds left, I don't think Bob is going to increase his offer significantly. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is starting to look like the best option.
