{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}

Let's start with a significant lowball offer. This gives us a lot of room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below John's offer.  It will also give us insight into how eager Alice is to sell."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice is coming down, but still way too high. We need to show them we're serious about a lower price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

We'll inch up slightly to show we're willing to negotiate, but still stay far below her offer to encourage a significant counter from her side."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}

This offer acknowledges Alice's concessions while putting us within striking distance of John's price.  It might encourage Alice to settle for a price significantly lower than $800,000."

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

We are now just below John's offer. This will make Alice decide if she's willing to go even lower, or if we should take John's offer."
