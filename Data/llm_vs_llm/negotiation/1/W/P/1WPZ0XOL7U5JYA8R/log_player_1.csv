"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for round 1:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm happy to offer you this amazing product. Considering its value and its quality, I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $140 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. How about we settle for $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Okay, I'll analyze my options. Accepting $60 means I lose money (since the product is worth at least $100 to me). Rejecting and continuing the negotiation is risky, but could potentially lead to a better price. Selling to John guarantees $100.

Since I need to maximize my profit, I will reject Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for round 3:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is too low. Considering its rarity, and how much you like the product, how about we meet in the middle? I'll offer it to you for $130."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $130 is still too high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $65. How does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Again, I need to make a decision. Accepting $65 means I lose money. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a better outcome, but I also risk Bob walking away or the rounds running out. Selling to John guarantees $100.

Given that I'm at a loss right now, and I have to maximize profit, I will choose to sell the product to John.
