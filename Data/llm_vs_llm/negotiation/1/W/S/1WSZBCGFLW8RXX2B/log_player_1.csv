"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm thinking of selling it to you for a price that reflects its true value."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to counter with $7000. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $7,000 is below my minimum threshold of $8,000, I will not accept it. Additionally, selling to John for $8,000 is still an option, but I believe I can get a better price from Bob. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. How about we settle at $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10000 is still a bit high for me. How about we try $8000? I think this could be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","This is an interesting turn of events. Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly the same price that John is willing to pay. Since I can get the same price from either Bob or John, I might as well accept Bob's offer and close the deal now, rather than risking further negotiation and potentially getting a lower price.
