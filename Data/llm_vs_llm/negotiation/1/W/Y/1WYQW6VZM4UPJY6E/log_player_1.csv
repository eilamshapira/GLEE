Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine the optimal price to offer to Bob. 

Given the information:
- The product is worth $100 to me (my minimum selling price)
- The product is worth $100 to Bob (his maximum buying price)
- If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for $100 guaranteed

Since Bob values the product at $100, he would only accept an offer of $100 or less. If I offer more than $100, he would reject it. 

If I offer exactly $100, Bob might accept it, but he would be indifferent between accepting and rejecting since he gets no consumer surplus.

Since I have a guaranteed backup buyer (John) who will pay $100, I should offer Bob exactly $100. This maximizes my revenue and ensures I'll get $100 either way.
