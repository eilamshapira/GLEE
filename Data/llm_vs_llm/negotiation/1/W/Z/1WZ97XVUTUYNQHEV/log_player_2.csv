Round 2

 ""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant jump down from Alice's starting point, but it keeps the negotiation moving.  The goal is to see how Alice responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the value this product brings justifies a higher investment. Let's meet in the middle at $1350000. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer while still recognizing the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

 ""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

We're now targeting Alice's estimated value for the product. This could be a good point to settle, but we'll see if she's willing to budge further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to close the gap further. How about $1275000? This price is a substantial reduction from my initial offer and should meet your needs while still reflecting the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
