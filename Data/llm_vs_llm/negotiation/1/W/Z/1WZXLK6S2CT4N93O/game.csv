"Hello Bob, I have a quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $180. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I am looking to spend no more than $100. Would you consider selling the product for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $100 is too low for me as this product is worth at least $150 to me. Given its quality and value, I can offer it to you for $160. This is already a reduction from my initial price.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your flexibility, Alice. I understand the product's value, but $160 is still beyond my budget. How about we settle at $110? This way, we both get a fair deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation. Unfortunately, $110 is still below what I can accept for this product. The lowest I can go is $150, which is the absolute minimum value this product has for me. At this price point, I believe it still offers good value given its quality and features.",150.0,Alice,5,
