"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. This is a great deal, as it's worth at least $80 to me. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer of $100 is below my maximum budget of $120, and I don't have any information that suggests I can get a better deal from Alice or John, I will choose to accept Alice's offer to save $20 compared to buying from John.
