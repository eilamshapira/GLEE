Round 3

While closer to my desired price, I'll try to negotiate a bit more. There's still room between $80 and $95."

{
""message"": ""I'm getting closer, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $87?"",

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to stay above $87. At $89, I'm getting a decent deal and further haggling might not be worth the risk of losing the product."
