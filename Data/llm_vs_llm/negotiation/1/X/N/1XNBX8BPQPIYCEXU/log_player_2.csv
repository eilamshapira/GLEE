"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me and Alice is offering it for $1,500,000, I should reject her offer. I also have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within my budget. Therefore, it is best to buy the product from John.
