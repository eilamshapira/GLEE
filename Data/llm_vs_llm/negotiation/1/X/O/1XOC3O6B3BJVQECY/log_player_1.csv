Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my options carefully. I know the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at exactly that price. However, I should see if I can get more from Bob.

The challenge is that the product is only worth $8,000 to Bob. Since this is less than my minimum value, any price I would accept (>$15,000) would be a loss for Bob. Since Bob is rational, he would reject any offer above $8,000.

Given that I have John's guaranteed offer at $15,000, it makes sense for me to make an offer to Bob that he will reject, ensuring I can sell to John instead.
