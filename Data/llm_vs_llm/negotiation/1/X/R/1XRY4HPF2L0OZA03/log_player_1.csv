Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 25000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a tricky situation. Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I need to make a profit. My options are:

*   **Accept:** I lose money.
*   **Counteroffer:** I risk Bob walking away, but potentially get a better price.
*   **Sell to John:** I get my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.

Since I need at least $15,000 and Bob is offering $10,000, I'll **reject** his offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

```json
{""product_price"": 22000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is still below my minimum. This is getting frustrating! I could risk another counteroffer, but the risk of him walking away is increasing. My options are:

*   **Accept:** I lose money.
*   **Counteroffer:** Risk losing the sale entirely.
*   **Sell to John:** Guarantee $15,000.

Given the situation, I think it's best to secure the $15,000.
