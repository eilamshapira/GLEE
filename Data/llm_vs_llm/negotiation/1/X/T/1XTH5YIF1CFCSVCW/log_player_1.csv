Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm willing to buy it from you at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
