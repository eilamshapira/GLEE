"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited about the possibility of you acquiring this extraordinary product. Given its unique value and potential benefits, I'm initially offering it to you for $1800000. I believe this price reflects its true worth, and I'm eager to discuss how it can meet your specific needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is more than twice my maximum value
3. John is willing to sell the product for $800,000

While I could try to negotiate with Alice, her initial offer is so high that it would likely take multiple rounds to reach a reasonable price, if at all. Since I have the guaranteed option to buy from John at my maximum value point ($800,000), I should just take that option.
