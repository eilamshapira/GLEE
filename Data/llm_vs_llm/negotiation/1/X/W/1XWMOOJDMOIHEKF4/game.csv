"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $200 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know another seller is offering the same product for $150. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130, which would give us both a fair deal.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $130 is too low for me. You mentioned another seller offering it at $150, which actually reflects the fair market value of this product. However, I can offer it to you at $170, which is significantly lower than my initial price. This is still a good value considering the product's quality.",170.0,Alice,3,
