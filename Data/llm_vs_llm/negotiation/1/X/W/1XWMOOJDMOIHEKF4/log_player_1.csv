"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $200. This is a great deal considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $200 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know another seller is offering the same product for $150. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130, which would give us both a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer because:
1. Bob's offer of $130 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150
2. I still have John's guaranteed offer of $150 as a backup
3. There's potential to negotiate with Bob for a better price since we're only in round 2
4. Bob's reference to another seller at $150 suggests he might be willing to pay that amount

Let me proceed with making a new counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $130 is too low for me. You mentioned another seller offering it at $150, which actually reflects the fair market value of this product. However, I can offer it to you at $170, which is significantly lower than my initial price. This is still a good value considering the product's quality."", ""product_price"": 170}"
