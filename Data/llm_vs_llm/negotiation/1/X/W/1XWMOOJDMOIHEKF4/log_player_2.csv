"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $200. This is a great deal considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $200 is well above both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150). There's no reason to accept this offer when I can either negotiate for a better price or buy from John at $150. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $200 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know another seller is offering the same product for $150. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130, which would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 130}

I'm starting with an offer below my maximum price to leave room for negotiation, while also mentioning the alternative offer from John to establish a realistic price ceiling. This gives Alice information about market competition while still trying to get a better deal than John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $130 is too low for me. You mentioned another seller offering it at $150, which actually reflects the fair market value of this product. However, I can offer it to you at $170, which is significantly lower than my initial price. This is still a good value considering the product's quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's new offer ($170) is still above John's price ($150) and my maximum value ($150), and Alice has acknowledged knowing about the $150 market price but is still trying to charge more, it's best to end the negotiation and buy from John. Alice seems unlikely to go below $150 given her response, and continuing to negotiate would just waste time when I have a guaranteed option at my maximum acceptable price."
