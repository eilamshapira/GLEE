"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $25000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $20000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll receive. Let me know if this works for you.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $20000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8000.  If this isn't acceptable, I'm prepared to purchase the product elsewhere.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see that you're firm on your budget, but I need to meet a certain threshold to make this sale worthwhile. I'm willing to lower the price further to $18000. This is my final offer before considering other options. Please let me know if this works for you.",18000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $18000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll be moving on.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but I need to meet a minimum price to proceed. I'm willing to come down to $16000, which is very close to my bottom line. This is my final offer before I consider other options. Let me know if this works for you.",16000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice,  I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $12000, which is a significant compromise for me. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Bob,8,
