"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Looking at the options:

1. Alice is offering the product for $150
2. I can reject Alice's offer
3. I can buy from John for $120

Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and John is offering it at exactly $120, Alice's offer of $150 exceeds my valuation. The logical choice is to buy from John instead of accepting Alice's higher-priced offer.
