"Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $25,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $15,000.
