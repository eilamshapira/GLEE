"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but I cannot accept $65 as it's below my cost. Given the product's value, I can offer it to you for $100. This is already a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $100 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
