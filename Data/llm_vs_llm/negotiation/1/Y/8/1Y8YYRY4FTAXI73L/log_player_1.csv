Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $110. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I think $110 is a bit too high. I am willing to buy the product for $65. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer since $65 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80, and even John's offer is better than this. I know the product is worth $120 to Bob, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but I cannot accept $65 as it's below my cost. Given the product's value, I can offer it to you for $100. This is already a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $100 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80, and he seems reluctant to move significantly higher, I'll take the guaranteed $80 from John rather than continue negotiating."
