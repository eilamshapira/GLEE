"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","In this case, Alice is offering the product for $100, and John is also selling it for $100. Since both offers are the same price, and the product is worth no more than $100 to me, I can choose either Alice or John.

There's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other, but since Alice has already made the offer directly to me, I'll go with:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
