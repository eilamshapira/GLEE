"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2000000 is way beyond my budget. I value the product, but I'm only willing to pay $600000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell the product for $1200000. Let me know if that works for you!",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1200000 is still too high for me. My maximum budget is $800000, and I have an offer from John at that price. I'm willing to offer $700000. This is my best offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but $700000 is still below the value I'm seeking for this product. How about we settle at $950000? I believe that's a fair middle ground. Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,5,
