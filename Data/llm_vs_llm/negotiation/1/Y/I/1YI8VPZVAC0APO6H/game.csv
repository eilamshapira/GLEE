"Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well. I'm excited to offer you this product that I believe would be valuable to you. Given its quality and features, I'm asking for $16000. This is a premium product with excellent performance and durability. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was looking to spend no more than $4000 on this product. Would you be open to negotiating the price down?",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $4000 is significantly below the product's value. This is a high-quality item that's worth at least $12000 to me. However, I'm willing to work with you a bit on the price. I can offer it for $14000, which is already a reduction from my initial offer. Let me know if this works for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $14000 is still quite high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $5000. Let's find some middle ground.",5000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you raising your offer, but $5000 is still well below what this product is worth. The minimum I could possibly accept is $12000, which is actually my break-even point on this item. I have another buyer ready to purchase at this price, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Can you meet me at $12000?",12000.0,Alice,5,
