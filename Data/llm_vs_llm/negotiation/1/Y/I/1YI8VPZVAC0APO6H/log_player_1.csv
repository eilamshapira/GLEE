Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $4,000 is significantly below the product's value. This is a high-quality item that's worth at least $12,000 to me. However, I'm willing to work with you a bit on the price. I can offer it for $14,000, which is already a reduction from my initial offer. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
