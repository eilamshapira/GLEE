"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great fit for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $19500. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth.",19500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $19500 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $15000 for it, which is fair considering my budget and the market value. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I know the true value of this product. While I understand your budget constraints, I need to get a fair return on this item. I can come down from my initial price - how about we meet in the middle at $17250? This is a significant reduction from my first offer and represents good value for the product's worth.",17250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and go with $16125? This is a good compromise that respects both our needs.",16125.0,Bob,4,
