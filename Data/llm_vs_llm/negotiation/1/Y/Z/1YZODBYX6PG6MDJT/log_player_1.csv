"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great fit for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $19,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 19500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $19500 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $15000 for it, which is fair considering my budget and the market value. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. While Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed price, I believe there's still room for negotiation to achieve a better outcome. I'll try to find a middle ground between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I know the true value of this product. While I understand your budget constraints, I need to get a fair return on this item. I can come down from my initial price - how about we meet in the middle at $17,250? This is a significant reduction from my first offer and represents good value for the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 17250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and go with $16125? This is a good compromise that respects both our needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $16,125. This price is better than John's guaranteed $15,000, and Bob has shown willingness to negotiate in good faith. While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk of losing both buyers if we push too hard, and this price represents a reasonable profit margin above my minimum acceptable price."
