"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm confident it's worth at least $800000 to me, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its potential.  Would you be interested in discussing a price of $1000000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is below my maximum budget of $1,500,000, and I don't know if I can get a better deal from Alice by negotiating, I will reject Alice's offer to see if she is willing to lower the price. If not, I can still buy the product from John for $1,500,000.
