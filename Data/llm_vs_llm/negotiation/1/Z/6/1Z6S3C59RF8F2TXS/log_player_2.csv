"Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to make a decision about Alice's offer of $25,000 for the product.

Given that:
- The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
- John is willing to sell the identical product for $10,000
- Alice's offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price

The logical choice is to buy from John instead of accepting Alice's high offer or continuing negotiations when I already have a guaranteed option at my maximum acceptable price.
