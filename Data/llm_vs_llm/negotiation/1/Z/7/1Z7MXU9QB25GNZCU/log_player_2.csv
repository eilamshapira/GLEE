"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd love! I'm offering it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this situation:

- Alice is offering the product at $120.
- I know the product is worth no more than $150 to me.
- John is willing to sell the same product for $150.

Since Alice's offer ($120) is less than what John is charging ($150), and it's below my maximum value, this is a good deal. I can save $30 compared to buying from John.
