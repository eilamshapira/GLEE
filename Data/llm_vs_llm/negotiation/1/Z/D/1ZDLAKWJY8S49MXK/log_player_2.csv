"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it will greatly benefit you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $10,000, Alice's offer of $12,000 is not a good deal for me. I would be paying $2,000 more than the product's maximum value to me.

The most economical decision would be to buy from John instead.
