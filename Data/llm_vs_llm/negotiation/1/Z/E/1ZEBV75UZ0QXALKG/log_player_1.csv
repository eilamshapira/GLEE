Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my pricing strategy here. I want to maximize my profit, but I also don't want to quote a price so high that Bob immediately rejects it.

Since the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price (John), I should set my price to Bob above this floor.

Without knowing how much Bob values the product, I'll set a price that gives me a substantial premium over my minimum value, but isn't so high as to seem unreasonable.
