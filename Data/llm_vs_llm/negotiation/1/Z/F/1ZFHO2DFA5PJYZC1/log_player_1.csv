"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $100 to me and only $80 to Bob, I'll start with a high offer but leave some room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $60 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, it makes more sense to sell to John rather than continue negotiating with Bob. Given that the product is only worth $80 to Bob, he will never offer more than $80, which is still below my minimum acceptable price.
