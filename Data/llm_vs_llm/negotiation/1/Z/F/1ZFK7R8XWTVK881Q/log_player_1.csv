Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll need to consider this carefully. I want to maximize my earnings from the sale, while also considering Bob's willingness to buy.

The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, so he won't pay more than that. However, the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I already have John willing to pay exactly that amount.

Since Bob values the product at less than what John is willing to pay, and less than my minimum value, the rational choice is to not lower my price for Bob.
