Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to strategically price my product to maximize my profit while ensuring Bob is likely to accept. The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob and $800,000 to me (my walkaway price since I can sell to John at this price).

I'll start with a price that gives Bob some value but still nets me a good profit. Since there's a $700,000 gap between Bob's valuation and my minimum, I'll aim for a price closer to Bob's valuation while leaving him some surplus to make it attractive.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll adjust my counteroffer to be more appealing to Bob while still maintaining a good position above my minimum price. Since Bob offered $900,000 and I initially asked for $1,200,000, I'll move down somewhat to show flexibility but still aim for a strong profit.
