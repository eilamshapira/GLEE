"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. After considering its market value and quality, I'm offering it to you for $10800. This is a fair price that allows you to gain significant value from this product while also respecting the value it holds for me. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer or look elsewhere.

Alice is offering the product for $10,800, while John is selling it for $12,000. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and I want to save as much money as possible.

If I accept Alice's offer, I'll pay $10,800, which saves me $1,200 compared to buying from John. This is clearly the better financial decision since both options would get me the same product.
