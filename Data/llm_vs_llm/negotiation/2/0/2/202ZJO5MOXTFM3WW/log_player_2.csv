"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is significantly higher than my maximum value for the product ($1,000,000) and also higher than John's price. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price. If Alice doesn't come down significantly, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

I'll offer $800,000, which is below John's price of $1,000,000. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to buying from John. If Alice rejects this offer, we can continue negotiating, or I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,400,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000). While Alice has moved down from her initial offer, it's still not competitive. I'll reject and make another counteroffer. If Alice doesn't come down to a more reasonable price, I can still buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 850000}

I'll increase my offer slightly to $850,000 to show some flexibility in negotiation while still staying well below John's price of $1,000,000. This gives Alice room to counter while keeping my potential savings significant. If Alice still doesn't come down to a reasonable price, I can always take John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's clear that Alice's offers are consistently remaining well above John's price of $1,000,000. While Alice has been reducing her price, the decrements are small, and she's still $350,000 above John's price. Given that:
1. Alice started at $1,500,000 and has only come down to $1,350,000 after several rounds
2. The gap between Alice's current offer and John's price is still very large
3. All of Alice's offers have been above my maximum value of $1,000,000

It's best to end the negotiation and take John's offer of $1,000,000. Further negotiation rounds with Alice seem unlikely to result in a better price than John's offer."
