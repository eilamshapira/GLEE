"Hello Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and features, I'm pricing it at $120. This is a fair offer considering the market value of similar products. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $60 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price considering my budget and the market value of similar products.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $60 is significantly below what I can accept for this item. The product is worth at least $100 to me, and I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay that amount. But I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can reduce my initial offer to $110. This is still a good value considering the quality of the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to propose $80 as a potential purchase price. This is the highest I'm comfortable paying, considering I have another option to buy the product from John at this price.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but I need to be transparent with you. This product is worth at least $100 to me, and I already have John willing to pay exactly that amount. Since you mentioned the product is worth $80 to you, we don't seem to have a mutually beneficial price point. I can offer it to you for $100, which is the absolute minimum I can accept - the same price John is offering. Otherwise, I'll need to proceed with selling to him.",100.0,Alice,5,
