Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and features, I'm pricing it at $120.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $60 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price considering my budget and the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $60 is significantly below what I can accept for this item. The product is worth at least $100 to me, and I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay that amount. But I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can reduce my initial offer to $110. This is still a good value considering the quality of the product."", ""product_price"": 110}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to propose $80 as a potential purchase price. This is the highest I'm comfortable paying, considering I have another option to buy the product from John at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but I need to be transparent with you. This product is worth at least $100 to me, and I already have John willing to pay exactly that amount. Since you mentioned the product is worth $80 to you, we don't seem to have a mutually beneficial price point. I can offer it to you for $100, which is the absolute minimum I can accept - the same price John is offering. Otherwise, I'll need to proceed with selling to him."", ""product_price"": 100}"
