Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can get a similar product elsewhere for $100. I would be willing to offer $75 for your product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75

However, I'd like to continue our negotiation. I can offer $85 for your product, which is a bit higher than my previous offer. Please let me know if this would work for you.
