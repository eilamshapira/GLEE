"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to carefully consider this offer. 

Alice is offering the product for $110, which is $30 above my maximum value ($80). Meanwhile, John is willing to sell me the exact same product for $80, which is exactly my maximum value.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and John's offer is already $30 better than Alice's current offer, the rational choice is to buy from John.
