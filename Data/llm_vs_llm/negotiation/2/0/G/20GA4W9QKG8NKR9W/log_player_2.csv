"Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","The offer from Alice is $250, which is more than the $100 the product is worth to me. It also exceeds the price that John is selling the same product for ($100).

Given these conditions, the best decision is to buy from John.
