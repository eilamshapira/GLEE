"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $115, which is a fair price considering its quality and value."", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, I believe $115 is a bit high. Given that I'm a serious buyer, I'd like to offer $105 for the product. This would still give you a good profit margin while being a more comfortable price point for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer in the next round. While $105 is better than selling to John for $100, I believe there's still room for negotiation since the product is worth $120 to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand you're looking for a better price. However, given the product's quality and value, I can offer it at $110, which is a fair compromise from my initial price and represents good value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}"
