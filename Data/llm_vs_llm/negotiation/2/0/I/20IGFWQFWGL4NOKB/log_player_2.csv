"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $115, which is a fair price considering its quality and value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this:
1. The product is worth up to $120 for me
2. Alice's offer is $115
3. I can buy from John for $120
4. Alice's cost is $100, so there's room for negotiation

Since Alice's offer is already better than John's price ($115 < $120), it's tempting to accept. However, knowing that Alice's cost is $100, there might be room to negotiate for a better price. A counteroffer could potentially save me more money.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's above Alice's cost but significantly below her initial offer:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, I believe $115 is a bit high. Given that I'm a serious buyer, I'd like to offer $105 for the product. This would still give you a good profit margin while being a more comfortable price point for me."", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand you're looking for a better price. However, given the product's quality and value, I can offer it at $110, which is a fair compromise from my initial price and represents good value for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice has reduced her price from $115 to $110
2. This is a $10 reduction from her initial offer
3. It's still $10 more than her cost ($100)
4. It's now $10 less than John's price ($120)
5. There's still some room for negotiation, but Alice has shown willingness to compromise

Since Alice has made a significant move in my direction and the price is now quite reasonable, I think it's wise to accept this offer. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing time and potentially having to settle for John's higher price if negotiations break down.
