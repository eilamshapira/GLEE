"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's price ($15,000), and it's also equal to my maximum valuation, there's no advantage in choosing one over the other. I might as well accept Alice's offer since she made it first.
