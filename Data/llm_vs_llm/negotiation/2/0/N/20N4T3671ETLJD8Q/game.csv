"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I think $9800 is a bit high for this product. Based on my market research, similar products are going for around $8500. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it. This would still give you a good profit while allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and your research, but the value of my product goes beyond those comparable listings. Considering its unique features and quality, I'm willing to let it go for $9000.

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that you've reduced it to $9000, which shows we're making progress. However, I'm still finding it a bit high for my budget. I could go up to $8750. This gives you a good return on your investment while helping me stay within my spending limits. This seems like a fair middle ground between our positions. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting really close! Thank you for coming down to $8850. I appreciate your flexibility in this negotiation. Since we're only $100 apart now, how about we meet in the middle at $8800? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can close the deal right away. What do you say?",8800.0,Bob,6,
