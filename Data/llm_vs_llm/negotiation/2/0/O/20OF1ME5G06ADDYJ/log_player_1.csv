"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $150. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is more than I'm willing to pay. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer in the next round. $100 is too low as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is below my minimum acceptable price. Given that the product is worth $120, I can come down to $135, which is a reasonable discount from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 135}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, but I'm still not quite there. How about $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and we seem to be having difficulty reaching an agreement above that price, I will sell the product to John for the guaranteed $120."
