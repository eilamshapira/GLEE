"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14000. Let me know if you're interested at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. While I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, I already know that John is willing to sell at $10,000, which is my maximum value. Given that Alice's starting price is so high ($14,000) and the product is worth $12,000 to her, it's unlikely we'll reach a better deal than John's offer.
