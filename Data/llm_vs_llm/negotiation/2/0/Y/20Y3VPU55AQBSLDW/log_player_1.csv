"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,000,000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll proceed with making a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and since I know I can get $1,200,000 from John, I'll try to negotiate for a better price with Bob before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, I must inform you that I have another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. However, I believe this product would be more valuable in your hands. I can offer it to you for $1,600,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects the product's true market value. Would you consider this offer?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the other buyer's offer of $1200000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $1300000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,300,000. This is a good outcome as it's $100,000 more than what John is offering, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing both deals. Bob has shown willingness to increase his price substantially from his initial offer, and this price provides a reasonable profit margin above my minimum acceptable price."
