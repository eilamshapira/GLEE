Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has already reduced the price from $2,000,000 to $1,600,000, and mentioned that there's another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and her current offer of $1,600,000. I'll offer $1,300,000, which is still below my maximum budget of $1,500,000.
