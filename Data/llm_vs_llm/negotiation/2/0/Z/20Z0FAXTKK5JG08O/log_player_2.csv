"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's alternative price ($10,000). It would be unwise to accept this offer since it's double what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. If negotiations don't progress favorably, I can always fall back on John's offer of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 8000}

Reasoning: I'll start with a counteroffer of $8,000, which is below John's price of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate upward if necessary while still potentially saving money compared to John's offer. Since Alice's initial offer was very high ($20,000), I'm starting relatively low to establish a more reasonable negotiating range. If Alice rejects this, I can gradually increase my offer in subsequent rounds while still staying below my maximum of $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: While Alice has reduced her price from $20,000 to $15,000, this is still significantly higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's alternative price ($10,000). There's no reason to accept this offer when I have a guaranteed option to buy at $10,000 from John. I'll continue negotiating since Alice has shown willingness to reduce the price, and there are still several rounds remaining. In the next round, I'll make another counteroffer that's closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9000}

Reasoning: I'll increase my offer to $9,000, which is $1,000 higher than my previous offer of $8,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate upward, but still keeps the price below John's offer of $10,000. Since Alice has shown flexibility by reducing her price from $20,000 to $15,000, I'm responding with a more substantial offer. This price point would give me a $1,000 savings compared to John's price while potentially being attractive enough for Alice to accept or at least continue negotiating towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: Alice has only slightly decreased her offer from $15,000 to $14,000, which is still well above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000). While Alice is showing some willingness to negotiate by lowering the price, the decrements are too small and the price is still far from acceptable. Since we're only in round 5 of 10, there's still room to negotiate. However, if the negotiations continue with such small decrements, I may need to consider taking John's offer in the later rounds to ensure I secure the product at a reasonable price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9500}

Reasoning: I'll increase my offer to $9,500, which is $500 higher than my previous offer of $9,000. This is my best offer so far and shows Alice I'm willing to come up significantly from my initial offer of $8,000. This price would still save me $500 compared to John's offer, while potentially being attractive enough for Alice to accept. We're now more than halfway through our negotiation rounds, so I'm making a more aggressive move toward a middle ground. If Alice doesn't respond with a more reasonable counter, I may need to seriously consider taking John's offer in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Reasoning: At this point, I'm choosing to buy from John for $10,000. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($13,000) is still $3,000 above John's price
2. Alice's price reductions have been very small (from $14,000 to $13,000)
3. Given the pattern of negotiations, it's unlikely Alice will drop her price below $10,000 in the remaining rounds
4. We're in round 7 of 10, and the risk of running out of time is increasing
5. The product is only worth $10,000 to me anyway

Rather than continue this negotiation with diminishing returns, it's more prudent to take John's guaranteed offer of $10,000 now. This ensures I get the product at my maximum acceptable price without risking further rounds of potentially unsuccessful negotiations."
