"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The offer from Alice is $20,000, which is significantly higher than the $8,000 the product is worth to me. It's also much higher than John's price of $8,000. Since I can get the same product from John at the maximum value I'm willing to pay, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer or even continue negotiating.
