"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to make a decision based on the offer and my options.

Alice is offering the product for $11,000, which is actually more than the $10,000 the product is worth to me. It's also more than John's guaranteed price of $10,000.

Since Alice's offer exceeds both my valuation and my alternative option, there's no reason to accept it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice values the product at $10,000 and is willing to sell it for $11,000, I'll make a counteroffer below her asking price but still allowing her to make some profit. I want to save as much money as possible while still being reasonable enough that she might accept.

{""product_price"": $9,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has lowered her offer to $10,500, but this is still higher than John's guaranteed price of $10,000. Since I can get the exact same product from John for $10,000, there's no reason to pay Alice $10,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has come down from $11,000 to $10,500, showing she's willing to negotiate. However, I still have the option to buy from John at $10,000. To make it worthwhile to continue negotiating with Alice rather than just going with John, I need to aim for a better price.
