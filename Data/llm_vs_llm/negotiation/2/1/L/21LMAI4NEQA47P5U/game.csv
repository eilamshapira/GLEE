"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer, but $9000 is too low for me to accept. The product is worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $13500.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $10500. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering we're both trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
