"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $12000 is at the very top of my budget. I can get the same product from another seller at that price. I'd like to propose $8500 for the product. This would be a fair price that works better for my budget while still providing good value for you. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $8500. I understand that $12000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. Considering your interest and willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you the product for $10500, which is a significant reduction from my initial price but still reflects the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price and making a substantial reduction. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. While $10500 is better than your initial offer, I'd like to meet you closer to the middle. I can offer $9500 for the product. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and would be a fair price for both of us. What are your thoughts on this?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $9500. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid and meet me halfway. After considering your latest proposal, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $10000, which is a further reduction from my previous counteroffer. This price reflects a serious commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement while ensuring I receive a fair value for the product. If this price is acceptable to you, I believe we can finalize the deal satisfactorily for both parties.",10000.0,Alice,5,
