"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $12000 is at the very top of my budget. I can get the same product from another seller at that price. I'd like to propose $8500 for the product. This would be a fair price that works better for my budget while still providing good value for you. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $8,500 because, although it's close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe the product is worth more, and I'd like to explore the possibility of getting a better deal. Since I have the option to sell to John for $8,000, which is my minimum value, I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can meet at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $8,500. I understand that $12,000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. Considering your interest and willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you the product for $10,500, which is a significant reduction from my initial price but still reflects the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price and making a substantial reduction. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. While $10500 is better than your initial offer, I'd like to meet you closer to the middle. I can offer $9500 for the product. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and would be a fair price for both of us. What are your thoughts on this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $9,500. Although Bob has increased his offer significantly and is moving closer to a price that I might consider, I still believe the product is worth more than $9,500. Since I have the option to sell to John for $8,000, which is my minimum acceptable price, and Bob's offer is above this threshold, I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. I'll make another counteroffer in an attempt to meet Bob's willingness to pay while also ensuring I get a fair price for the product."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $9,500. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid and meet me halfway. After considering your latest proposal, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $10,000, which is a further reduction from my previous counteroffer. This price reflects a serious commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement while ensuring I receive a fair value for the product. If this price is acceptable to you, I believe we can finalize the deal satisfactorily for both parties."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
