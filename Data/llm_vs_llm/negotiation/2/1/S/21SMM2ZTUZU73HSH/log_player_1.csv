"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I certainly can't go as low as $80, but I'm willing to negotiate. How about the following counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 110}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 110}

I understand that we both want to find a good deal, so I've come down from my initial price. This offer is much closer to what you proposed, so hopefully, we can meet in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

After considering Bob's offer, I've decided to accept it. Although it's not my initial goal, it's still a reasonable profit for the product. Let's proceed with the transaction."
