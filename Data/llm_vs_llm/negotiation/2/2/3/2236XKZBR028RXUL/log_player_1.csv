Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my price offer to Bob. While I know the product is worth at least $100 to me (and I have a guaranteed backup buyer at that price), I don't know how much Bob values it.

If I set the price too high, Bob might reject it, and I'll end up with my minimum of $100 from John. If I set it too low, I might leave money on the table. However, since I have the $100 backup option, I can afford to be somewhat aggressive with my pricing to Bob.
