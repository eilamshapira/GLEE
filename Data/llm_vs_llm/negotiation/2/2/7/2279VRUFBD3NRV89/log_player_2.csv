"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice's offer is $120, which is below my maximum value
3. Jhon's fixed price is $150, which is significantly higher than Alice's offer
4. I have 10 rounds of negotiation available
5. Since Alice mentioned she's open to negotiation, I might be able to get an even better price

Given that Alice's initial offer of $120 is already $30 less than Jhon's price, but there might be room for further negotiation, I'll reject this offer and try to get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably lower than Alice's initial offer but not so low as to be offensive. Since she started at $120, I'll try to negotiate down while maintaining a constructive dialogue.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Your product looks interesting, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. Would you consider $90 for the product? This would be a fair price that I'm comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you think $90 is a fair price, but I still believe the product is worth more. I'm willing to compromise, but not that much. How about we meet in the middle between my initial offer and your counteroffer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let's analyze Alice's new offer:

1. Alice has dropped from $120 to $105, showing willingness to negotiate
2. The new price of $105 is $45 less than Jhon's price
3. Alice seems reasonable and willing to find middle ground
4. While we might get a slightly better price, continuing negotiation carries the risk of Alice becoming less flexible

Given that:
- The price is now significantly below my maximum value of $150
- We've already achieved a good discount from both the initial offer and Jhon's price
- Alice has shown reasonable negotiation behavior
- The current price represents good value

I'll accept this offer as it's a fair compromise and represents good savings compared to my alternatives.
