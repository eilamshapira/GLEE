"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I think $14500 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $11000 as it's actually below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value, and I know it's worth at least $15000 in the market. However, I'm willing to come down to $13500 to make this deal work for both of us. This represents a $1000 discount from my initial offer and provides you with excellent value.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice, but I still find the price a bit high. I'm willing to raise my offer to $11500.",11500.0,Bob,4,
