I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer. Since Alice came down by $50, I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer and her new offer.

Since Alice has been gradually decreasing her price, I'm hoping she'll be willing to meet me closer to my target price. I'll make a new counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one, to show that I'm still interested in negotiating.
