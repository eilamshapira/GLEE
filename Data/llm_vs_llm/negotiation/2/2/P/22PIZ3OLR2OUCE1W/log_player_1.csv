Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","This is a tough one. $60 is significantly below my minimum. However, I also don't know how much Bob values the product, so there's a chance he'd be willing to pay more. Considering the current offer is very low, I will try to get Bob to pay a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 220}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob is still offering very low. However, I have to consider that this is the second offer I received from him. Based on the price trend, Bob doesn't seem to be interested in paying a lot. Since the best I can get now is $70, I will sell the product to Jhon.
