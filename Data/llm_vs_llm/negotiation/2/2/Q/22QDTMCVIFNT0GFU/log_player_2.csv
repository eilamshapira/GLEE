"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $900000. I believe this is a fair price given its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Evaluating Alice's offer:

1. Alice is offering the product for $900,000
2. The product is worth at most $800,000 to me
3. I can buy the same product from John for $800,000

This is straightforward. Alice's price ($900,000) exceeds both the value to me and John's alternative price. It makes financial sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for $800,000.
