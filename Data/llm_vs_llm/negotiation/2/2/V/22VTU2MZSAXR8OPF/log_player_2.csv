"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is more than its worth to me ($12,000) and more than John's price ($12,000).

Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $12,000, it makes financial sense to buy from John rather than accept Alice's higher price.
