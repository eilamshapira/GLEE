"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I believe could be a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it for $15000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer of $15,000 is higher than both my maximum valuation ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000), it wouldn't be rational to accept Alice's offer. The best option is to buy from John for $10,000.
