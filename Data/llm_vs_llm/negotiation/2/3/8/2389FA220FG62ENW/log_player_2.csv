# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. It's highly valuable, and I'm sure you'll appreciate it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250. This is a great opportunity to own a premium product. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is far too high. You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no reason to even consider paying $250."
