Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","$4,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, there's no reason to accept such a low offer. However, I'll reject and try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John, as there might still be potential to get a better price from Bob.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial price significantly but still maintain a price above my minimum value to show flexibility while ensuring profitability.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $6,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000, and his increase from $4,000 to $6,000 suggests he's not willing to approach a price near my minimum value. Given that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, and Bob seems unwilling to make substantial increases in his offers, it's best to end the negotiation and take the guaranteed $12,000 from John.
