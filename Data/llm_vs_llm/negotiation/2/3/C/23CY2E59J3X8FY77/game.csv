"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1700000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $850000 at this time.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to make an offer. However, I must say that $850000 is a bit lower than I had hoped for. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $1600000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at this point.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1600000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider this.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $1000000. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to make another compromise and meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I can offer it to you for $1300000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's worth.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  If you're serious about selling, I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
