"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative price ($8,000), it makes sense to reject this offer. Even if Alice rejects my counteroffer, I can always fall back on John's offer, which is already at my maximum acceptable price. There's potential to negotiate with Alice for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6000}

I'll offer $6,000 to Alice. This is well below my maximum value of $8,000 and John's price, giving me room to negotiate upward if necessary. Since Alice's initial offer was quite high at $12,000, starting low at $6,000 gives space for potential compromise while still potentially saving money compared to John's offer of $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's new offer of $10,000 is still above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000), and Alice has only reduced her price by $2,000 from her initial offer, it seems unlikely that we'll reach a price below $8,000. At this point, it's best to take John's guaranteed offer of $8,000 rather than continue negotiating with Alice, who seems to be maintaining prices above my maximum value."
