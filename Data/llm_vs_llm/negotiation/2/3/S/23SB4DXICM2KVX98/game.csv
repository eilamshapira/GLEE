,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $10000 is a bit high for what I'm looking to spend. Given the current market conditions, I would be willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is a fair price that would be beneficial for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $9500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can increase my offer to $9000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer. This price would be fair for both of us, considering the market value of the product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
