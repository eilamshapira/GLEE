"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product sounds interesting, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm looking to spend less than that. How about $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to get a fair price for the product. How about we split the difference and meet at $150?",150.0,Alice,3,
