Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a price that I think reflects its value."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product sounds interesting, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm looking to spend less than that. How about $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120, I will not accept it. Additionally, selling to John for $120 is an option, but I believe I can get a better price from Bob. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to get a fair price for the product. How about we split the difference and meet at $150?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
