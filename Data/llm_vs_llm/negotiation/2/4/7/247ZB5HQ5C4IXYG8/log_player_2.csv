"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering you my product for $150. I believe it's a great value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $150
2. John is also selling it for $150
3. The product is worth no more than $150 to me
4. I have negotiation power since I can always go to John
5. It makes sense to try negotiating with Alice for a better price

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($150), and I have the opportunity to negotiate with Alice for a potentially better deal, I should reject Alice's initial offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be offensive:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $150 is a bit high for me. I know another seller offering the same price, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $100? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

This counteroffer makes sense because:
1. It's a significant reduction but not unreasonable
2. I mention the competition (John) indirectly to create leverage
3. I remain polite and show interest in doing business with Alice
4. It leaves room for negotiation upward if needed
5. I'm starting low enough that even if we meet in the middle, I'll still save money compared to John's price"
