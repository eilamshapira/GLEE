"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. If you're interested, please let me know. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth $150 to me (maximum I'm willing to pay)
2. Alice is offering it for $150
3. John is selling it for $150

Since all prices are equal ($150), and it doesn't matter financially which seller I choose, I might as well accept Alice's offer since she's already engaged in the negotiation with me.
