"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $17000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $6000 is too low. I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $14000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and market demand.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $14000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your revised offer. I'd like to propose a price of $10000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable price for the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, I'm afraid $10000 is still a bit short of my expectations. I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer it to you for $13000. If this price doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,5,
