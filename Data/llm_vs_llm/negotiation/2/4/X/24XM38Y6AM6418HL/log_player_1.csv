Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider the price to offer to Bob. 

The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, so he would theoretically be willing to pay up to that amount. However, I have a guaranteed fallback option to sell to John for $10,000 if Bob rejects my offer.

Since the product is worth no less than $10,000 to me, I want to maximize my profit while still giving Bob enough incentive to accept. If I price too close to $12,000, Bob might reject it since he would gain very little value.

A reasonable approach would be to split the $2,000 difference between Bob's valuation ($12,000) and my fallback option ($10,000), so I'll offer the product at $11,000. This gives Bob a $1,000 surplus while allowing me to earn $1,000 more than my fallback option.
