"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's offer of $18,000 exceeds both the maximum value to me ($8,000) and the price at which I can buy from John ($8,000), it wouldn't make sense for me to accept Alice's offer. Even trying to negotiate with Alice would be risky since her starting price is so high and the product is worth $15,000 to her.

The most logical choice is to buy from John at $8,000, which equals the maximum value of the product to me.
