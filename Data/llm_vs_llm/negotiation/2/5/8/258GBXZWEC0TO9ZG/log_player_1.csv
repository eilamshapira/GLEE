Send your offer to Bob.,"Looking at this situation, I need to consider the constraints carefully:

1. The product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me
2. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob
3. If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell to John for $1,200,000

Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, any price above that will be rejected. If Bob rejects my offer, I'm guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, which is already higher than Bob's maximum value. Therefore, it makes the most financial sense for me to offer Bob a price that gives me at least as much as my guaranteed alternative.
