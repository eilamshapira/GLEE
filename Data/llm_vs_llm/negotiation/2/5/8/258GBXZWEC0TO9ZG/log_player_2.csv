"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given the information provided, let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: The product would cost $1,200,000, which is actually more than it's worth to me (as you mentioned it's worth no more than $1,000,000 to me).

2. Reject Alice's offer: This would mean I don't get the product from Alice.

3. Buy from John for $1,000,000: This price matches exactly what the product is worth to me maximum, and is $200,000 less than Alice's offer.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and John's offer is significantly better than Alice's, I should go with option 3.
