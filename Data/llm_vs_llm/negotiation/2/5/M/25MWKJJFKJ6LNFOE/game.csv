"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1300000. This price reflects the value it can bring to your business.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking for a price that aligns better with my budget. How about $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $900000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's keep the conversation going.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach a deal. Your offer of $850000 is simply too far below what this product is worth to me.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll need to explore other options. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
