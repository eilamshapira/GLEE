"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be great for you. I'm offering it to you at $150. This is a quality product that I'm confident will meet your needs. Let me know if you're interested in making this purchase.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is lower. Would you consider selling it for $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $70, that's below what I can accept for this item. I understand you have budget constraints, so I can come down to $130. This is a high-quality product that's worth the investment. Let me know if this works better for you.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks Alice, but $130 is still more than I'm willing to pay. The most I can offer at this point is $80. Let me know if that works.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I need to consider my costs as well. I can come down to $115, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but I'm really trying to stay under $100. How about $90? That's the absolute highest I can go.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiations. I understand you're trying to stay under $100, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. My best and final offer is $105. This is extremely close to your limit and represents a substantial discount from where we started. If this doesn't work for you, I unfortunately will need to pursue other buyers who have expressed interest at the $100 mark.",105.0,Alice,7,
