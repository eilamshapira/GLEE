"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for a special price. Would you like to buy it for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the price Alice is offering ($120) is higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($100), I will reject Alice's offer and consider buying from John instead, but I will not buy from John yet, I will just reject Alice's offer.
