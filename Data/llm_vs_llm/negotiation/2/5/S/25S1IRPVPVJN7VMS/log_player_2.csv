"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product! Considering its high value and exclusivity, I'm willing to let it go for a special price just for you. What do you think about $10000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me. Alice is offering it for $10,000. If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy the product from John for $8,000. Since $8,000 is less than $10,000, I should reject Alice's offer and buy from John.
