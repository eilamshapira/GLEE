Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob
2. My minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000
3. I have a guaranteed fallback of $1,000,000 from John
4. Bob knows his maximum value but doesn't know my minimum
5. To maximize my profit, I should price it close to Bob's maximum value while ensuring he's still likely to accept

I'll offer a price that leaves Bob with a small but meaningful surplus to incentivize acceptance, while capturing most of the value for myself.

{""product_price"": 1400000}

This gives Bob a $100,000 surplus while giving me $400,000 more than my fallback option with John. It's high enough to maximize my profit but low enough that Bob should rationally accept."
