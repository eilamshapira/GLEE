"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $95
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: $100

Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice's offer ($95) is lower than John's price ($100), it makes sense to accept Alice's offer. This will save me $5 compared to buying from John.
