"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to analyze this offer carefully:

- The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me
- Alice is offering to sell it for $2,400,000
- John is willing to sell the same product for $1,500,000
- My goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible

Alice's offer ($2,400,000) is significantly higher than both the product's worth to me and John's price. The most economical choice is clear.
