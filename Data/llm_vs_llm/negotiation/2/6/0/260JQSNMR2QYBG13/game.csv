Hello Bob! I have a great product for you that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm asking for $200 for it.  What do you think?,200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"That's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Would you be open to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is unfortunately too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?  I'm confident you'll find this a good deal.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $110.  Let's try to close this deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's compromise at $125.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $125 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $105. If you're serious about selling this, I think this is a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,6,
