"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is under your $10,000 limit, there's room to negotiate. Alice is clearly motivated to sell since the product is only worth $8,000 to her. Rejecting her initial offer might lead to a better counter-offer."
