Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer that I believe is more reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $900,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. 

My counteroffer: $1,800,000"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you think the initial price was a bit high, but I believe the product's value lies in its uniqueness and rarity. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I get a fair price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your new offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think the price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer that I believe is more reasonable and closer to the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than John's offer of $1,200,000, and I have the option to sell to John at any moment, it's in my best interest to accept John's offer. This ensures I get a higher price for the product than Bob's current offer."
