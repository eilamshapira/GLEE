{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget of $8,000. It makes more sense to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to start by offering my absolute maximum price.  This will give Alice a clear idea of my budget and hopefully start the negotiation process."
