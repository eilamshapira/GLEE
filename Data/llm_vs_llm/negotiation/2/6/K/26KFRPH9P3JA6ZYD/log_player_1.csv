Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at that price, I'll start with a higher offer to Bob to leave room for potential negotiation while ensuring I can still make a good profit.

{""product_price"": 1,800,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000, and it's a reasonable decrease from my initial offer, I'll accept this offer.
