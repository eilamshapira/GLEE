Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $120 is lower than my minimum price of $150 and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

My counteroffer is: $180

So, the response is not one of the three options you specified, but rather a counteroffer. However, to fit the format you requested:
