Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider both the minimum value of the product to me ($8,000) and what Bob might be willing to pay.

Since I know I can always sell the product to John for $8,000, that creates a floor for my offer. However, I want to maximize my profit by trying to get more from Bob if possible.

I'll offer a price that's higher than my minimum value but still potentially attractive to Bob:

{""product_price"": 12500}"
