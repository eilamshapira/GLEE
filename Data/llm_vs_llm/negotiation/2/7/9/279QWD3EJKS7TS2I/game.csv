"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, I can't go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I was hoping we could do a bit better than that. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. I think it's a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal if you are.",100.0,Bob,4,
