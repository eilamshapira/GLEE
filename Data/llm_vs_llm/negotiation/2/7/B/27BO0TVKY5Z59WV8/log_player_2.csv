"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since I'm only willing to pay up to $100 for this product (as stated in my constraints), and John is offering it for exactly $100, Alice's offer of $120 is too high for me to accept. While I could make a counteroffer to Alice, I already have a guaranteed option to get the product at my maximum price point.
