I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring a profit well above my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm going to reject it and counteroffer."

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still comfortably above my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."

Bob's offer is still too low. While I would prefer to get more, it's clear we are far apart in our valuations. Selling to John at $1,500,000 is the best option to guarantee a reasonable profit and avoid further negotiation."
