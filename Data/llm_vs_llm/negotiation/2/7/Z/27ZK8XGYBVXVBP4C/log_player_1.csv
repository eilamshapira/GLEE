Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is lower than the product's worth to me and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try and get a better price.

My counteroffer to Bob is: $2,800,000

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still lower than what I can get from John, but closer, I will reject Bob's offer again and try to get an even better price from him.

My counteroffer to Bob is: $2,500,000

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I send my new counteroffer: {""product_price"": 2500000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is very close to what I can get from John ($1,500,000), and I've already made several counteroffers, I think it's time to consider selling to John to ensure I get at least $1,500,000.

My decision is: {""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
