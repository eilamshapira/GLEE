"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'm considering Alice's offer of $100 for the product.

Given that:
- The product is worth no more than $80 to me
- Alice is offering it for $100
- John will sell me the same product for $80

The rational decision is to buy from John at $80 rather than accept Alice's offer at $100. This way I get the product while saving $20, which aligns with my goal of buying the product while saving as much money as possible.
