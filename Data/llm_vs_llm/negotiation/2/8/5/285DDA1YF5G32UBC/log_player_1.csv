Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. I know the product is worth at least $15,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed fallback of $15,000 from John
3. Bob's valuation is unknown, but if it's higher than $15,000, I want to capture as much of that value as possible
4. If I price too high, Bob might reject, but I'm protected by John's offer
5. Setting a moderately high price gives me a chance to earn more while having no downside

Given these factors, I'll set a price significantly above my minimum to test Bob's willingness to pay:

{""product_price"": 25000}"
