Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive rights to this exceptional product. Given its unique qualities and potential, I'm prepared to offer it to you for $2,500,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer, but I find the price to be much higher than what I am looking to pay. I am ready to purchase the product for $600000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $600,000, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and given that I can sell to John for $1,000,000, I'm going to choose to sell to John.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
