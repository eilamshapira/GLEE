"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this premium product. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $2200000. This represents an excellent investment opportunity with substantial potential for returns. What do you think?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product sounds promising, but $2200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1500000, which is still a significant investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1500000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below what this premium product commands in the market. I can come down to $1950000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects the true value of this investment opportunity. How does that sound?",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1950000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1700000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close the deal at this price.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your continued interest. I can see we're moving closer to an agreement. Given the exceptional quality and value of this product, I can offer it to you for $1850000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offers and represents excellent value. I believe this is a fair middle ground between our positions. What do you think?",1850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1850000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1700000. It's a fair price for both of us and lets us finalize this deal. What do you say?",1700000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand budget constraints are important. I see you're firm at $1700000, but I need to ensure I'm receiving fair value for this premium product. Let's meet in the middle at $1775000. This is my best offer and represents significant value given the product's quality and market position. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price point.",1775000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $1775000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and close the deal at $1737500. This feels like a fair outcome for both of us, and I'm confident we can be happy with this price.",1737500.0,Bob,8,
