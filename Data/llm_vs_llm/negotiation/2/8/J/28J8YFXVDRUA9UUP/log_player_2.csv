"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price. Please consider buying it for $13000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering the product for $13,000, but this product is only worth $8,000 to me. Since John is willing to sell me the exact same product for $8,000, which matches my maximum valuation, it makes more financial sense to go with John's offer.
