"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand your budget, $1000000 is too low for me to accept. Considering the investment I've made in this product, and its unique nature, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. How about $2250000?",2250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2250000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1500000.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
