Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll aim higher with Bob to maximize my potential profit. I'll set the price at $18,000, which allows for significant profit potential while still being a reasonable market price.
