Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $14000 is a bit high for my budget. I've done some market research, and considering the product's features and comparable options, I'm prepared to offer $11500. This seems fair given the current market conditions and would allow us both to benefit from this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough one. Bob's offer is above my minimum, but still leaves some profit on the table. I have to consider that further negotiation might not be fruitful, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'll try to get a bit closer to my ideal price.
