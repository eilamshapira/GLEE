"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000, which is a fair price given the value it will bring to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $15,000 is:
1. Above my maximum value ($12,000)
2. Higher than John's offer ($12,000)
3. Would result in a loss of value for me

The logical choice is to buy from John at $12,000, which matches my maximum value and saves me $3,000 compared to Alice's offer.
