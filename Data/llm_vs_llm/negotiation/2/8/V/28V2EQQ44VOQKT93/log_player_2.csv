"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $900,000, which is less than $1,000,000, I should accept the offer. This is better than buying from John for $1,000,000.
