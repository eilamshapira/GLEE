"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $140
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John at $120

Since:
- The product is worth no more than $120 to me
- Alice's offer ($140) is higher than my maximum value ($120)
- John is offering the product at $120, which matches my maximum value
- My goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible

The logical choice is to buy from John for $120, as it saves me $20 compared to Alice's offer and matches my maximum value for the product.
