Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it has great value and I'm looking to get a fair price for it.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, I'm looking to get the best possible deal. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to get closer to the product's value to Bob, which is $1,500,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I still believe the product is worth more than $1,000,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but that's still a bit too high for me. My budget is tight, and I'm aiming for a better deal. How about $1050000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer, trying to get closer to a mutually beneficial price. Since Bob's offer is increasing, it shows he's interested in the product, and I believe I can still get a better price than $1,050,000. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer of $1,125,000, which is still below the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000) but higher than his current offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I see you're willing to increase your offer, and I appreciate that. However, I still need to get a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but that's still a bit above my comfort zone. Let's try this: $1100000 is my final offer. I'm eager to make this deal happen, but that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Bob's final offer of $1,100,000 is close enough to my target price, and it's a significant amount above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Considering we're already at Round 6 and Bob has stated this is his final offer, I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for more. Accepting this offer ensures I secure a good price for the product."
