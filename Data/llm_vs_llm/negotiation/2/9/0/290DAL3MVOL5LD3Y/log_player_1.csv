"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to sell the product for $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
This is a reasonable offer that provides a good profit margin above my minimum price of $8,000. It's better to secure this deal now rather than risk losing it by negotiating further."
