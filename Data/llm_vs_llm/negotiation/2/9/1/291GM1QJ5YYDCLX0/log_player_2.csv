"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you this exclusive product for $150. Let me know if you’d like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Based on the situation, I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $150. Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and John is willing to sell the same product for $120, Alice's offer is not a good deal.

I could accept John's offer immediately, but I'll try negotiating with Alice first to see if I can get an even better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I can't pay $150 for this product. I know I can get the same product from John for $120. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if you can offer me a better price. Would you consider $90 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m willing to offer you the product for $115. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has offered the product for $115, which is $5 less than John's price of $120. Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and Alice's offer is below that threshold, this is a good deal. I'll accept Alice's offer to save $5 compared to buying from John.
