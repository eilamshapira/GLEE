"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $500000 for it.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $500000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll lower my initial price to $1800000, which I believe is still a fair price for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1800000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I see that we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, $750000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make another compromise and lower my price to $1600000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for another revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1600000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product, which is my highest offer so far. I hope we can reach a mutually agreeable price soon.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for another revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product, which is very close to my maximum budget. I hope we can reach a deal soon.",950000.0,Bob,8,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about being close to your maximum budget. Considering the product's value and the progress we've made in our negotiations, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll lower my price to $1050000, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to consider other options. I hope we can reach a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
