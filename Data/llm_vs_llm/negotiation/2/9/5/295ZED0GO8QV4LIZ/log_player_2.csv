"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to assess if Alice's offer is reasonable. She's offering the product for $120, which is more than the product is worth to me (maximum $100) and more than John's offer of $100. There's no reason for me to accept this price.

Since John is offering the product at $100, which is the maximum value to me, I should either negotiate with Alice to get a better price or buy from John.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives us both some room to negotiate.

{""product_price"": $85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has reduced her price from $120 to $110, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but $110 is still more than John's offer of $100. There's no reason for me to pay more than $100 when I can get the same product from John at that price.

I'll reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price below $100, which would actually save me money compared to buying from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $120 to $110, I'll raise my previous offer a bit but stay well below John's price of $100.

{""product_price"": $90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has now offered $105, which is getting closer but is still higher than John's price of $100. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, there's no reason to accept a price above $100.

I'll continue negotiating to see if Alice will go below $100. If we can't reach a deal below $100, I can always buy from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has been gradually reducing her price, moving from $120 to $110 to $105. I'll increase my offer slightly to show good faith in the negotiation, but still aim for a price that saves me money compared to John's offer.

{""product_price"": $95}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice is now offering the product for $100, which is exactly the same as John's price and the maximum value of the product to me. 

At this point, I have two equally priced options:
1) Accept Alice's offer at $100
2) Buy from John at $100

Since neither option saves me money compared to the other, and we've been negotiating in good faith with Alice, I'll accept her offer.
