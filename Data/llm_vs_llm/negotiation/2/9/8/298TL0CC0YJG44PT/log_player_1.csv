Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be beneficial for you. Given its unique features and market value, I'm offering it at $1,800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's quality and potential value."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, the price is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $900000 for the product considering its value to me. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

The rationale is clear here. Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $1,500,000, it makes the most sense to sell to John. Even if I continue negotiating with Bob, since the product is only worth $1,000,000 to him, he will never offer more than that amount, which would still be less than John's offer. Therefore, selling to John is the optimal decision."
