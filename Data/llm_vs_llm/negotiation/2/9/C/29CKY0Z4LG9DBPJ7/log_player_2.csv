"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given that Alice's offer is $120, which is the same price as John's offer, and considering that this is the product's maximum value to me, there's no advantage in continuing the negotiation. Even if I make a counteroffer, I can't get a better deal than $120 since that's what John is offering. Therefore, I might as well accept Alice's offer now.
