"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1750000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I have another seller offering it at that price. However, I value the possibility of doing business with you. I can offer you $950000 for the product. This is a fair offer considering my alternatives.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1200000, recognizing the value you place on this product. This represents a significant compromise on my end. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
