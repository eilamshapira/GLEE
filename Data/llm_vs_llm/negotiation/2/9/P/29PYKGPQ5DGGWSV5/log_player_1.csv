"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1750000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I have another seller offering it at that price. However, I value the possibility of doing business with you. I can offer you $950000 for the product. This is a fair offer considering my alternatives. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum asking price.

What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
