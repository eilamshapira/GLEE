"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,750,000 is way above my maximum value of $1,000,000. It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer when I can either:
1. Try to negotiate with Alice for a better price
2. Buy from John for $1,000,000

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and I have another seller offering it at that price. However, I value the possibility of doing business with you. I can offer you $950,000 for the product. This is a fair offer considering my alternatives."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1200000, recognizing the value you place on this product. This represents a significant compromise on my end. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above my maximum value of $1,000,000, and she seems unlikely to drop the price below $1,000,000 (given that the product is worth $1,500,000 to her), it makes the most economic sense to buy from John at $1,000,000. This way, I get the product at my maximum acceptable price without wasting more time in negotiations."
