"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. I'm offering my product for $2000000. Please let me know if this price works for you or if you have any questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's offer of $2,000,000 exceeds the maximum value that I (Bob) am willing to pay for the product, which is $1,000,000. Since Alice is offering a price that's double my maximum budget, and I have a guaranteed option to purchase the same product from John for exactly $1,000,000, the rational decision would be to choose option 3.
