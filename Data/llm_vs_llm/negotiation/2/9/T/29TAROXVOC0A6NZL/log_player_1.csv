Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have this great product I think you'll really love. I'm offering it to you for $145. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $145 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, I need to decide between $110 from Bob, a negotiation with Bob, or $120 from John. I know the product is worth at least $120 to me. Considering Bob values it at $150, I think I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest Bob. I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
