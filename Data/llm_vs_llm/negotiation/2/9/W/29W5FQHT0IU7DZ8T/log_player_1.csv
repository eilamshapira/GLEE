Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that the product is unique and rare, but $2000000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $500000 for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and the value of the product to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a better option than accepting Bob's offer, but I want to try to negotiate a better price with Bob first."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the concession, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1800000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still lower than what I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. Since John is willing to pay $1,000,000, I have a better alternative.

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the concession, Alice. I understand that you have other options to consider, and I'm willing to make a serious offer to acquire the product.

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept, but it's still lower than John's offer of $1,000,000. Since I have a better alternative, I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer yet. However, I want to try to negotiate a better price with Bob, as he seems willing to make serious offers.
