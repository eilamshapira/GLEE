"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is good, but there's a chance to get the product for even less. Since I have a comfortable backup option with John, I will try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's to see how much room for negotiation there is. This offer is 62.5% of Alice's original price and gives me a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice came down significantly from her initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. However, there's still room for improvement, and I want to aim for a price closer to my initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:** This offer represents a compromise. It's halfway between my last offer ($750,000) and Alice's current offer ($1,000,000). This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a substantial discount."
