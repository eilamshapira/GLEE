"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for sale. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to start the negotiations at $230. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $230. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $230
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","The initial offer of $230 is significantly higher than my maximum valuation of $150. Therefore, I should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since my maximum value for the product is $150, I want to start with a low offer to see how much room there is for negotiation. I'll offer $80, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle.

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $230 is too high for me. Would you consider $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $80 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $180? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's counteroffer of $180 is still above my maximum value of $150. I will reject it, but I'm also seeing that Alice might not be willing to go low enough. I will consider buying from John if the next offer is not close to $150.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
