"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I need to make an initial offer that is competitive but also aims to maximize my profit. The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, and I have a fallback option of selling to John for $1,200,000. I'll start with a price on the higher end, leaving room for potential negotiation.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","I notice that Bob is now offering exactly the same amount that John is willing to pay ($1,200,000). Since both options would give me the same revenue, and continuing to negotiate with Bob gives me potential upside, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

Round 5
