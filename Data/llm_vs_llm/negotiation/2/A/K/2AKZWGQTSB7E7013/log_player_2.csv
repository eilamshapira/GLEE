Alice's offer is quite close to John's price. There's a good chance we can negotiate a lower price with Alice in the next rounds."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm staying firm below $1,300,000. This offer is a good balance between trying to get a lower price and the risk of the negotiation failing."

This offer is a good deal, saving me $210,000 compared to John's price. It's getting late in the negotiation, and further haggling might not yield a significantly better price."
