"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $12000. This is a competitive price for the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12000 is significantly above my budget and the market value I've researched. I can get the same product from another seller for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Would you consider $6500 for the product? This would save me some money compared to my alternative option, while still providing you with a reasonable profit.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I know for certain that the product's value is higher than $6500. You mentioned you can get it for $8000 elsewhere, which actually aligns more closely with the product's true market value. Given this, I'm willing to offer you the product for $9000, which is significantly lower than my initial price and provides you with better value than my competitors when considering the product's quality and reliability. Would this work for you?",9000.0,Alice,3,
