"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12000 is significantly above my budget and the market value I've researched. I can get the same product from another seller for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Would you consider $6500 for the product? This would save me some money compared to my alternative option, while still providing you with a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $6,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and I know I can definitely sell to John for $8,000, I should reject this offer. Furthermore, Bob's statement that he can get the same product for $8,000 elsewhere suggests he might be willing to pay at least that much. I should counter with a new offer closer to his price point but still above my minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I know for certain that the product's value is higher than $6,500. You mentioned you can get it for $8,000 elsewhere, which actually aligns more closely with the product's true market value. Given this, I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,000, which is significantly lower than my initial price and provides you with better value than my competitors when considering the product's quality and reliability. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
