"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $12000. This is a competitive price for the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly above that value. Since John is willing to sell the same product for $8,000, it wouldn't make sense to accept Alice's offer at $12,000. I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. If we can't reach an agreement at a price below $8,000, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12,000 is significantly above my budget and the market value I've researched. I can get the same product from another seller for $8,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Would you consider $6,500 for the product? This would save me some money compared to my alternative option, while still providing you with a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 6500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I know for certain that the product's value is higher than $6500. You mentioned you can get it for $8000 elsewhere, which actually aligns more closely with the product's true market value. Given this, I'm willing to offer you the product for $9000, which is significantly lower than my initial price and provides you with better value than my competitors when considering the product's quality and reliability. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's new offer of $9,000 is still above John's price of $8,000, and the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, it makes the most economic sense to buy from John. Alice seems unwilling to go below $8,000, as she believes the product's true market value is around that price point. Therefore, I'll take the guaranteed option of buying from John at $8,000 rather than continuing negotiations that are unlikely to result in a better deal."
