Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 15000}

Rationale: Since I know I can sell the product to John for $15,000, and this amount is my minimum acceptable price, there's no reason to offer Bob a lower price. The product is only worth $10,000 to Bob, so he will likely reject my offer, but that's acceptable because I can then sell to John for $15,000. Making a lower offer would only reduce my profits, as the product is worth at least $15,000 to me."
