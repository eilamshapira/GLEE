"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know what you think.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $200 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $40 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",40.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $40 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $175.  This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's make a deal.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand where you're coming from, but $175 is still too high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $60. Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",60.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $60 is simply not enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $117.50. This is a substantial discount from my original price and a reasonable compromise. Let's close this deal.",117.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the effort you're making to meet me in the middle, but $117.50 is still too high. I'm willing to raise my offer to $70. We're getting closer to an agreement that works for both of us.",70.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  we are getting closer, but $70 is still far too low. I'm willing to come down to $90 for the product. This is a significant compromise, but I'm hopeful we can finally reach an agreement. Let's make this happen.",90.0,Alice,7,
