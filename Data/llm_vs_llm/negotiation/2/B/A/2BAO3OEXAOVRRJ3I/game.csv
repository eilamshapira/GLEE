"Bob, I'm excited to begin discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its exceptional value and the significant benefits it offers, my initial asking price is $1450000.",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1450000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget, I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for it. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand budget considerations. However, $1000000 is lower than I can accept given the product's unique capabilities and the value it brings to you. I'm willing to come down a bit, to $1375000. How does that sound?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1375000 is still a bit outside my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's significantly more than your valuation of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! While $1200000 is still a bit less than ideal, I'm willing to meet you in the middle a little more. How about $1300000? That's a significant concession on my part, and I think it reflects a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This is a fair price that represents a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're a tough negotiator! I'm impressed. While $1250000 is tempting, I'm going to stick closer to my valuation. Let's try $1280000. This is my best offer at this stage.",1280000.0,Alice,7,
