Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand budget considerations. However, $1000000 is lower than I can accept given the product's unique capabilities and the value it brings to you. I'm willing to come down a bit, to $1375000. How does that sound?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer! While $1200000 is still a bit less than ideal, I'm willing to meet you in the middle a little more. How about $1300000? That's a significant concession on my part, and I think it reflects a fair compromise.
