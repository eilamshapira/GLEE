Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
