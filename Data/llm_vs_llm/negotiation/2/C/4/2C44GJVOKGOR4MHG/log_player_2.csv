"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Based on the information provided, I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $100, reject it, or buy from John for $80.

Since:
- The product is worth no more than $80 to me
- Alice is offering it for $100
- John is selling the same product for $80

The logical choice is to buy from John at $80, as it matches the maximum value I place on the product and is $20 cheaper than Alice's offer.
