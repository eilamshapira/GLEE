Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and try to counter with a price closer to my desired value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm going to counter with $150. This is still a decent amount above my minimum, but it's also lower than my initial offer, showing some flexibility and willingness to negotiate."

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still going to reject it. I want to see if I can squeeze out a few more dollars."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}

I'm going to counter with $125. This is only $5 above my minimum, so it's a pretty big concession. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good deal and accept."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've gone through several rounds of negotiation, but it seems like Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price.  It's getting late in the game and I'm at risk of getting a lower price. I'm going to sell the product to John for $120, which is my minimum."
