"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $180, but I know that the product is worth no more than $120 to me. Additionally, I have the option to buy from John for $120 at any time.

Since Alice's price ($180) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's alternative price ($120), it makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

However, this price is still higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's alternative price ($120). Since I can buy the same product from John for $120, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $150.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 8
