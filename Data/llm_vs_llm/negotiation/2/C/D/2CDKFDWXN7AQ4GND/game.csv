"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the perceived value and rarity, $20000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to offer $4000.  This offer reflects my current budget and perceived market value. I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiation, and I look forward to your response.",4000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you see its value. However, I must say that $4000 is significantly below my expectations. Considering the product's quality, rarity, and potential benefits, I'm willing to make a concession and lower my initial price. I'm now offering the product to you for $18000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the product's true value. I'm open to further negotiations and look forward to your response.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $18000 is still too high.  I understand you value the product highly, but my budget is firm. I can increase my offer to $5500.  This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my genuine interest in the product. Let me know if this works for you.",5500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid, and I'm glad to see that you're genuinely interested in the product. However, I must reiterate that $5500 is still below my expectations. Considering the product's value and the fact that I've already made a concession, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current bid. I'm now offering the product to you for $16500. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the product's true worth. I'm open to further negotiations and look forward to your response.",16500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, while I appreciate the movement, $16500 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $6500, but that's my absolute limit. I need you to meet me closer to my price if we're going to make a deal.  This offer is a strong indication of my seriousness, and I hope we can find common ground.",6500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid again, and I acknowledge that you're trying to meet me halfway. However, I must reiterate that $6500 is still significantly below the product's value. Considering your seriousness and willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to make a more substantial concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $14000. This price is the lowest I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm open to further negotiations, but I hope we can finalize the deal soon.",14000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, $14000 is still too high.  My final offer is $7000. If you can't accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm not willing to go any higher.  Let me know your decision.",7000.0,Bob,8,
