Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and features, I'm offering it at $25,000. This is a competitive price for a product of this caliber. Would you be interested?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $25000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $12000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $10000 for the product. This gives you a chance to make the sale today rather than losing the opportunity completely. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand budget constraints, but I can't accept $10,000 as that's below my cost. I should mention that I actually have another buyer, John, who's willing to pay $15,000 for this product. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Given the product's quality and value, I can come down to $18,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is still excellent value compared to similar products on the market."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. However, I need to clarify something - you mentioned another buyer named John willing to pay $15000, but I actually know John is selling this same product for $12000. That's my guaranteed alternative if we can't reach an agreement. The product is worth $12000 to me, so I can't justify paying more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $11500, which is very close to my maximum and gives you a sale today rather than no sale at all if I walk away. This is my best offer considering my alternatives. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
