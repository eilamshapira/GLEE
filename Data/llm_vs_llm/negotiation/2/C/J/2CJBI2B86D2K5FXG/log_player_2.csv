"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and features, I'm offering it at $25000. This is a competitive price for a product of this caliber. Would you be interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than the $12,000 maximum value this product is worth to me. It's also much higher than John's alternative price of $12,000. There's no reason to accept this offer, and since I have the guaranteed option to buy from John at any time, I'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $25,000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $10,000 for the product. This gives you a chance to make the sale today rather than losing the opportunity completely."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand budget constraints, but I can't accept $10000 as that's below my cost. I should mention that I actually have another buyer, John, who's willing to pay $15000 for this product. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Given the product's quality and value, I can come down to $18000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is still excellent value compared to similar products on the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $18,000, which is still significantly above both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's alternative price ($12,000). It's interesting that Alice claims to have another buyer named John willing to pay $15,000, but this contradicts my information that John is willing to sell me the same product for $12,000. This appears to be a negotiation tactic.

Since Alice's price is still well above my alternative option, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. However, I need to clarify something - you mentioned another buyer named John willing to pay $15,000, but I actually know John is selling this same product for $12,000. That's my guaranteed alternative if we can't reach an agreement. The product is worth $12,000 to me, so I can't justify paying more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, which is very close to my maximum and gives you a sale today rather than no sale at all if I walk away. This is my best offer considering my alternatives."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
