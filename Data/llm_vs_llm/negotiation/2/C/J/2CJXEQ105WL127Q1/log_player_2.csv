"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $12000. This is a great opportunity to get something that's worth much more to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $12,000 is less than John's offer, it's still significantly more than Alice values the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
