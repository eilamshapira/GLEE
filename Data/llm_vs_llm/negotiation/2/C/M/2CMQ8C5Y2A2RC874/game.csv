"Alice, thank you for the offer, but I find the price to be quite high. I'm looking to spend no more than $8000 on this product. Would you be willing to accept this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I must say that $8000 is quite lower than what I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value and our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a better price, but it's still higher than your offer.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12000 is still above what I'm looking to spend. I understand the product's value, so I'm willing to raise my offer to $9000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your revised offer of $9000. It shows that you're serious about acquiring the product. However, I still need to get a price that better reflects the product's value. I'm willing to make a concession, but not as large as you might hope. How about we meet at $10500? This is as low as I'm comfortable going, considering the product's worth.",10500.0,Alice,5,
