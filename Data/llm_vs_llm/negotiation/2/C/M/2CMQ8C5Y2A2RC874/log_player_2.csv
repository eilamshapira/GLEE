"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Let's start negotiating. Alice's initial price is too high, so I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.)

# Bob's message to Alice in the next round:
# Alice, thank you for the offer, but I find the price to be quite high. I'm looking to spend no more than $8,000 on this product. Would you be willing to accept this price?"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but I find the price to be quite high. I'm looking to spend no more than $8,000 on this product. Would you be willing to accept this price?"",
""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I must say that $8000 is quite lower than what I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value and our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a better price, but it's still higher than your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Alice is coming down on her price, so let's keep negotiating. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round.)

# Bob's message to Alice in the next round:
Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12,000 is still above what I'm looking to spend. I understand the product's value, so I'm willing to raise my offer to $9,000. What do you think?"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12,000 is still above what I'm looking to spend. I understand the product's value, so I'm willing to raise my offer to $9,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your revised offer of $9000. It shows that you're serious about acquiring the product. However, I still need to get a price that better reflects the product's value. I'm willing to make a concession, but not as large as you might hope. How about we meet at $10500? This is as low as I'm comfortable going, considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

(Alice's offer is only slightly lower than John's price, so it makes more sense to buy from John at this point.)

# Bob's message to Alice:
Alice, I appreciate your concession, but I've decided to purchase the product from another seller who offered me a price of $10,000. Thank you for your time and negotiation efforts."
