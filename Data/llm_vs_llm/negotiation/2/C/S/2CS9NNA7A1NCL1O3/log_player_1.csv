I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation."

I'm counteroffering at $8,500. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a significant increase from Bob's last offer.  I hope this is a price that Bob will consider."
