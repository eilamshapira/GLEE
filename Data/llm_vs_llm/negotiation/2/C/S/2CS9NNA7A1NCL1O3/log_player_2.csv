"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I should consider whether Alice's offer of $10,000 is better than my alternative option of buying from John for $8,000.

Since Alice's offer ($10,000) exceeds my maximum valuation ($8,000) and also exceeds John's price ($8,000), it makes no sense to accept it. I should either reject and make a counteroffer or just buy from John.

Since I have 10 rounds available to negotiate and might be able to get a better price from Alice than $8,000, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price, leaving room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": $5,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has now offered $8,500, which is still higher than John's price of $8,000. Since I can buy the product from John for $8,000, and Alice's current offer exceeds that price, it still makes more sense to reject this offer. I'll either need to get Alice to come down to at least $8,000 or simply buy from John.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer to see if Alice will come down further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly but still aim to get a price better than John's $8,000 alternative.

{""product_price"": $6,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has now offered $8,000, which is exactly the same as John's price. At this point, I'm indifferent between buying from Alice or John at the same price. However, since I still have 5 more rounds of negotiation available, I could try to get Alice to lower her price even further.

I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal than $8,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.
