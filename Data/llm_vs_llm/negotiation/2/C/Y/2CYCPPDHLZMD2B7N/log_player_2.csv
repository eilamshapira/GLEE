"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a relatively low offer.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $13,000 is still higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($10,000), but it's getting closer. Since I've already offered $9,000 and she rejected it, I'll try to meet her halfway again and make another counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $12,000 is still higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($10,000). At this point, I'm getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I don't want to overpay for the product. Since I can buy the same product from John for $10,000, I think it's time to stop negotiating with Alice and buy from John instead.
