"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm offering for sale. Given its features and market value, I'm selling it for $300. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and benefits. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price?",300.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, the price is a bit too high for me. Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I'm willing to offer $100.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $100 is too low for me as it doesn't reflect the product's true value. I understand that $300 might be higher than your budget, so I'm willing to come down to $250. This is still a great deal considering the quality and benefits of the product. Would this price work for you?",250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the updated offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, it's still a bit outside of what I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $175?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget.",175.0,Bob,4,
