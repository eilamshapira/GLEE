"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  I'm keeping in mind my minimum value of $10,000 but aiming for a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $13,500. This is a fair compromise, and hopefully, it will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit and getting closer to my desired price.  I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and ending up selling to John for a lower price."
