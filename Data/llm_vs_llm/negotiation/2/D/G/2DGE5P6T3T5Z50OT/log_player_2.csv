"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I notice that Alice is offering the product for $1,300,000, which is $100,000 more than what the product is worth to me ($1,200,000). Meanwhile, John is offering to sell the product for exactly $1,200,000, which matches the maximum I'm willing to pay.

Since Alice's offer is higher than my maximum value, and John's offer exactly matches my maximum acceptable price, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice or accept her above-value offer.
