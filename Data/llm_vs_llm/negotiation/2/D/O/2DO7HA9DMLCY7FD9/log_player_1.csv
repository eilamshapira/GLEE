Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Considering its rarity and unparalleled qualities, I'm offering it to you for $2,500,000."", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $2500000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $750000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your initial offer, but I believe we can find a price that reflects the true value of this product. I am willing to lower the price, but $750,000 is far too low. How about $2,300,000?"", ""product_price"": 2300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $2300000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but we need to find a price that works for both of us. How about $850000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
