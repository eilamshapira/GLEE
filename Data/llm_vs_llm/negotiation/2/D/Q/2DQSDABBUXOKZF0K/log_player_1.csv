"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000, to see if Bob is truly serious about this product. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still ensuring I make a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more. Bob is clearly interested, so I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,250,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still leaving a significant profit margin for me. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal. While I was hoping for slightly higher, I'm confident in the value of my product and I'm happy to close the deal at $1,125,000. It's a good profit and I'm avoiding the risk of further negotiation."
