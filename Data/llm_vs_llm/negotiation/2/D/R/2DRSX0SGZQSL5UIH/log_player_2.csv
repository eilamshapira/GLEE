"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. If you're interested, please consider my offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $20,000
3. John is offering the same product for $12,000
4. If I accept Alice's offer, I would be paying $8,000 more than my maximum value
5. John's offer matches my maximum value for the product

Since Alice's offer ($20,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's alternative offer ($12,000), the rational decision would be to buy from John.
