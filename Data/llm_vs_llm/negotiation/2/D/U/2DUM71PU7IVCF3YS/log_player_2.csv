"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Based on the information provided:

1. Alice is offering to sell the product for $15,000
2. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me (Bob)
3. John is offering the same product for $15,000

Since both Alice and John are offering the product at the same price ($15,000), and this price equals the maximum value of the product to me, I'm indifferent between the two sellers.
