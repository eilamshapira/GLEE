"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be beneficial for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and potential value."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is way above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time.  This is a fair price given my needs and the market value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

The reason I choose to sell to John is because:
1. Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000
2. Bob's statement that $800,000 is his budget suggests he's unlikely to raise his offer significantly
3. John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 matches my minimum acceptable price
4. Given the large gap between Bob's offer and my minimum price, continuing negotiations would likely be unproductive and waste time
5. Taking John's offer ensures I get my minimum desired value immediately without further negotiation risk"
