"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,200,000
2. Alice's offer is $1,000,000, which is below my maximum
3. The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there might be room for negotiation
4. John's price ($1,200,000) is higher than Alice's current offer
5. If I reject, I can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price

Given these factors, I'll reject Alice's offer because:
- $1,000,000 is still quite high compared to Alice's value ($800,000)
- I can make a counteroffer and try to get a better price
- I still have John's offer as a backup
- There's no immediate risk in negotiating further

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's above Alice's cost ($800,000) but significantly below her initial offer ($1,000,000). I'll propose $850,000, which:

1. Gives Alice a $50,000 profit over her value
2. Would save me $150,000 compared to her initial offer
3. Is much better than John's price ($1,200,000)
4. Leaves room for further negotiation if needed

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. Alice has lowered her price from $1,000,000 to $950,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. The new price is $250,000 less than John's price ($1,200,000)
3. While there might still be room for negotiation, Alice has moved $50,000 from her initial position
4. Continuing to negotiate might risk Alice becoming less flexible
5. The current offer represents a reasonable profit for Alice while giving me a good savings

Given that:
- The price is significantly below my maximum value
- We've already seen some good movement in the negotiation
- Further negotiation might not yield much better results
- The deal is much better than John's alternative

I'll accept this offer.
