"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, considering the product's features and market value.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget considerations, $10000 is below what I can accept given the product's value. However, I'm willing to be flexible. Would you consider $14500? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents excellent value for the product's quality and features.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering my budget and the product's value, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and it's also the price at which I can buy the product from another seller.",12000.0,Bob,4,
