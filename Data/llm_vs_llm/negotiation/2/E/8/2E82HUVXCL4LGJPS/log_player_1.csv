Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $18,500. This is a competitive price for the product's features and benefits."", ""product_price"": 18500}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, considering the product's features and market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Given that Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly the same as John's guaranteed offer, and it's at my minimum acceptable price, I'll reject this offer and make a counter-offer. Since Bob is showing interest in the product, there's potential to negotiate a better price that would benefit both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget considerations, $10,000 is below what I can accept given the product's value. However, I'm willing to be flexible. Would you consider $14,500? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents excellent value for the product's quality and features."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering my budget and the product's value, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and it's also the price at which I can buy the product from another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $12,000. This is a reasonable deal because:
1. It's $2,000 more than John's guaranteed offer of $10,000
2. Bob has indicated this is his maximum price and mentioned he has an alternative at this price
3. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely, and we'd end up with John's lower offer"
