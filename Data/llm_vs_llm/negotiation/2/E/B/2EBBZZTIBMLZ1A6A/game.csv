"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  While $5000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $17000. This product is truly unique and I'm confident it can bring you significant value.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down to $17000, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to make another counteroffer, hoping we can meet in the middle.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It seems we're still quite far apart on price. I'm willing to make a significant move to $13000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of this product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your significant move to $13000, Alice. However, I'm still not ready to meet you at that price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9000, hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence but $9000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $11000, but this is absolutely my final offer.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options.",11000.0,Alice,7,
