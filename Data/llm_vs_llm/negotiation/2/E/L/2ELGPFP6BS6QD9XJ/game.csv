"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value and rarity of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $8000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to make a compromise and lower the price to $11000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short of being comfortable with the price. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $9500.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. Considering your offer of $9500, I'm willing to make another compromise and lower the price to $10500. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can close the deal soon.",10500.0,Alice,5,
