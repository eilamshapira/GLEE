"Alice's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'll analyze this situation:

- The product is worth at most $80 to me (Bob)
- Alice is offering me the product for $99
- Alternatively, I can buy it from John for $80

Since Alice's offer ($99) exceeds what the product is worth to me ($80), and I can buy the same product from John for exactly $80, I should choose to buy from John.
