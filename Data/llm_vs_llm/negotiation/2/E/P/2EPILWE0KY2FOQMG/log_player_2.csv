"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I should consider the following:

*   **My Valuation:** The product is worth $12,000 to me.
*   **Alice's Offer:** $11,000.
*   **John's Offer:** $12,000.

Since Alice's offer is better than John's offer, I should accept Alice's offer.
