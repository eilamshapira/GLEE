``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters. It also demonstrates that I believe the product is valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more,  $8,000 is my minimum, and I'm happy to sell to Bob at this price.  It's a quick and easy sale, and I don't want to risk dragging the negotiation out and potentially losing the sale entirely."
