"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm very interested in the product, $8800 is a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $6000.  I believe this is a fair price considering market value and I hope we can reach an agreement.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $6000 is below its true value. I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for $8400, which is closer to its actual worth. I'm open to further negotiations.",8400.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  $8400 is still a little high for me.  I can go up to $6800. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my strong interest in acquiring the product.  Let me know what you think.",6800.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price, but $6800 is still below the product's true value. Considering your strong interest in acquiring the product, I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $8200. This is a fair price, and I'm open to finalizing the deal.",8200.0,Alice,5,
