"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm very interested in the product, $8800 is a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $6000.  I believe this is a fair price considering market value and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to both of us, I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I still have the option to sell to John for $8,000 if negotiations with Bob don't improve. 

My next offer will be: 
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $6,000 is below its true value. I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for $8,400, which is closer to its actual worth. I'm open to further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 8400}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  $8400 is still a little high for me.  I can go up to $6800. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my strong interest in acquiring the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $6,800 is still lower than the product's value to both of us, and I have a better option with John, I will reject his offer and make another counteroffer. However, I will try to be more aggressive in my pricing to see if Bob is willing to meet me closer to the product's actual value.

My next offer will be: 
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price, but $6,800 is still below the product's true value. Considering your strong interest in acquiring the product, I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $8,200. This is a fair price, and I'm open to finalizing the deal."", ""product_price"": 8200}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks again for working with me. I understand you value the product highly.  I'm willing to stretch my budget to a final offer of $7400.  This is the absolute highest I can go.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to pursue other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,400. 
You have three options:

Since Bob's final offer of $7,400 is still lower than the product's value to both of us, and he has indicated that he cannot go any higher, I have decided to sell the product to John for $8,000. This option guarantees me a higher price and ends the negotiation process."
