"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given the options, I'll analyze the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $2,500,000, which exceeds the $800,000 maximum value it has to me
2. John is offering to sell me the same product for $800,000
3. My goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible

Since John's offer is significantly lower than Alice's and equals the maximum value I place on the product, the logical choice is to buy from John.
