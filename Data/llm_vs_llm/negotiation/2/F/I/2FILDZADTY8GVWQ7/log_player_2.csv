"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm offering it to you for $18000. This is a great opportunity to acquire something that is worth every penny. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully. 

The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me. Alice is offering to sell it to me for $18,000, which is $10,000 more than its value to me.

John is willing to sell me the same product for $8,000, which matches the maximum value I place on it.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and Alice's offer ($18,000) is significantly higher than both my valuation and John's alternative offer ($8,000), the logical choice is to buy from John.
