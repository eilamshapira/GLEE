"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given that:
- The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
- John is willing to sell the product for $12,000
- Alice is offering the product for $15,000

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both the product's worth to me and John's alternative price. The rational decision is to buy from John at the lower price.
