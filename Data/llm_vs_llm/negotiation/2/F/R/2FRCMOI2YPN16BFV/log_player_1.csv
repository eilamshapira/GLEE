"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 300}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","$50 is far too low and well below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $150, I would never accept an offer below that amount. However, I'll reject and make a counteroffer since there might still be room for a better deal with Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial price but still maintain a strong position since I have John's $150 offer as a backup.

{""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer of $75 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and he's only increased his offer by a small amount. Since I have John's guaranteed offer of $150, and Bob doesn't seem to be making substantial increases in his offers, it's starting to look like selling to John might be the best option.
