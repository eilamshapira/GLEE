"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $300 is far too high, considering the product is only worth $100 to me and I have John's offer of $100 as a backup. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I have John's offer of $100 as a backup, and the product is worth no more than $100 to me, I'll start with a low offer to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 50}

This counteroffer of $50 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $300, but it gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's $100 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $250 is still far above my maximum value of $100 and higher than John's guaranteed price of $100. While Alice has reduced the price from $300 to $250, showing some willingness to negotiate, this price is still not acceptable. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $300 to $250, showing some flexibility, I'll increase my previous offer slightly but still stay well below my maximum value.

{""product_price"": 75}

This offer is higher than my previous $50 bid, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still gives me significant savings compared to John's $100 offer. If Alice doesn't accept this, I still have several rounds left to negotiate or can always fall back on John's offer."
