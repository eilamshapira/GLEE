"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly higher than John's guaranteed $800,000, and it's early in the negotiation (only round 2), I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There's still room to negotiate for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still maintain a strong position for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob has increased his offer from $900,000 to $950,000, showing willingness to negotiate upward. This is a good offer, significantly better than John's $800,000, and we're already in round 4. While there might be room to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal increases with each round, and this is a solid profit margin. I'll accept this offer.
