"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's alternative price ($1,000,000). It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. Since we have 10 rounds of negotiation available, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice for a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price, giving room for negotiation while still being reasonable.

{""product_price"": 600000}

This counteroffer of $600,000 is:
1. Well below John's price of $1,000,000, giving room for negotiation
2. A significant reduction from Alice's initial $1,500,000 offer
3. Might help understand Alice's bottom line based on her response
4. If rejected, still leaves room for future counteroffers in subsequent rounds"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has lowered her price from $1.5M to $1.2M, showing willingness to negotiate, but this is still above John's price of $1M. Since we have several rounds left for negotiation, it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to try to get a better price than John's $1M. If we can't reach a better deal, we can always take John's offer later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice reduced her price by $300,000 (from $1.5M to $1.2M), I'll also adjust my offer upward from my previous $600,000, but still stay well below John's price to maintain negotiating room.

{""product_price"": 800000}

This counteroffer of $800,000:
1. Shows movement from my side (increased from $600K to $800K)
2. Maintains a good margin below John's price of $1M
3. Signals willingness to meet in the middle
4. Is a significant increase from my last offer (33% increase), showing good faith in negotiations
5. Still leaves room for further negotiation if needed"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice continues to move down in price ($1.5M → $1.2M → $1.1M), but her offer is still $100,000 above John's price. Since we still have several rounds left and Alice has shown consistent willingness to reduce her price, it's worth one more attempt to negotiate below John's price. If we can't get a better deal in the next couple of rounds, we can always fall back on John's offer of $1M."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given Alice's consistent downward movement and that we're getting closer to John's price, I'll increase my offer again but stay below John's price.

{""product_price"": 950000}

This counteroffer of $950,000:
1. Shows significant movement from my last offer ($800K to $950K)
2. Is still $50K below John's price, maintaining our advantage
3. Represents a reasonable gap from Alice's last offer ($1.1M), potentially meeting in the middle
4. Shows we're serious about closing the deal
5. If rejected, we can still fall back on John's offer

The negotiation pattern suggests Alice might be willing to come down further, and this offer gives her room to counter while keeping us in a good position relative to our alternative with John."
