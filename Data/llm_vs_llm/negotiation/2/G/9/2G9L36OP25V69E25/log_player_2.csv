"Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $149
2. John's price is $150
3. The product is worth up to $150 for me (Bob)

Alice's offer is only $1 cheaper than John's price. While it is technically a better deal than John's offer, the difference is minimal. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is very close to my maximum valuation of $150, I should reject this offer. This might encourage Alice to come back with a better offer, knowing that her product is only worth $80 to her.
