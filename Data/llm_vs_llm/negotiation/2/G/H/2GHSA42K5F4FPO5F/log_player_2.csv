"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,400,000 is way above my maximum value of $800,000, and it's even above Alice's own value of $1,200,000. It would be better to either negotiate for a lower price or buy from John. Since I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'll make a counteroffer of $700,000. Here's my reasoning:
1. My maximum value is $800,000
2. John's offer is $800,000
3. Alice's cost is $1,200,000
4. By offering $700,000, I'm giving Alice an opportunity to negotiate while still staying well below my maximum value
5. Even though this is significantly below Alice's cost, it provides a starting point for negotiation
6. If Alice rejects this, I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000"
