"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1150000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer: $1,150,000
2. Product's worth to me (Bob): No more than $1,000,000
3. John's guaranteed offer: $1,000,000

Since Alice's offer ($1,150,000) is:
- Higher than what the product is worth to me ($1,000,000)
- Higher than John's offer ($1,000,000)

The logical choice would be to buy from John, as it:
- Saves me $150,000 compared to Alice's offer
- Matches the maximum value I place on the product
