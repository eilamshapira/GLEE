Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is a bit higher than my budget. Given my current valuation, I'm willing to offer $1000000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is lower than what John is willing to pay ($1,200,000), and it's also lower than the product's value to me, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better price. My next offer will be lower than my initial offer but still higher than John's offer, to leave room for negotiation.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I'm willing to lower my price, but I still believe the product is worth more than your initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1800000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1500000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Since Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is higher than what John is willing to pay ($1,200,000), I will continue to negotiate with Bob to try to get an even better price. However, I will also consider that Bob has made a significant increase from his previous offer, so my next counteroffer will be more moderate.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the increase, and I'm glad we're making progress.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I'm getting closer to my budget, $1650000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1400000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Since Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than what John is willing to pay ($1,200,000), I will continue to negotiate with Bob to try to get a better price. However, I notice that Bob's offer has actually decreased from his previous offer of $1,500,000, which is a red flag. I will make a cautious counteroffer to try to bring the price back up.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm a bit surprised that your offer decreased from $1,500,000 to $1,400,000. I'm still willing to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,550,000.
