"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be of great value to you. Based on market analysis and the exceptional features of this product, I'm offering it to you for $2000000. This is a premium opportunity that I'm extending to you first, though I do have other interested parties including John who has already offered $1000000. I believe this product will provide significant value to your business and is worth every penny of my asking price. Would you like to proceed with this offer?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I've done some research and I believe the product is worth around $1200000. I'm willing to pay that price for it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your offer of $1200000, which shows you recognize the value of this product. However, given the unique capabilities and advantages this product offers, I believe my initial price was closer to its true market value. That said, I'm willing to work with you and can reduce my asking price to $1750000. This is still significantly below what similar products command in the market, and represents an excellent investment opportunity for you. Please consider this counteroffer carefully.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for reducing the price to $1750000, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think the price is a bit high. As I mentioned earlier, I have another option to buy a similar product from John for $1500000. Considering that, I'm willing to pay $1400000 for your product. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your updated offer, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress in our negotiation. I understand you mentioned having another option from John at $1500000, which actually reinforces that my product is valued in this higher range by the market. Given this information, I can offer you my product for $1600000, which is still better than John's option for what I believe is a superior product. This represents a significant reduction from my initial price and demonstrates my commitment to working with you. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price point.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for reducing the price to $1600000, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable paying more than $1500000 for the product. As I've mentioned before, John is willing to sell me a similar product for that price, and I'm inclined to take him up on his offer if we can't reach an agreement. That being said, I'm willing to pay $1500000 for your product, and I'm throwing in a bit of a sweetener - if you accept this offer, I'll commit to the purchase immediately and we can finalize the details today. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
