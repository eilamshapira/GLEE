Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I've done some research and I believe the product is worth around $1200000. I'm willing to pay that price for it.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your offer of $1,200,000, which shows you recognize the value of this product. However, given the unique capabilities and advantages this product offers, I believe my initial price was closer to its true market value. That said, I'm willing to work with you and can reduce my asking price to $1,750,000. This is still significantly below what similar products command in the market, and represents an excellent investment opportunity for you. Please consider this counteroffer carefully."", ""product_price"": 1750000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for reducing the price to $1750000, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think the price is a bit high. As I mentioned earlier, I have another option to buy a similar product from John for $1500000. Considering that, I'm willing to pay $1400000 for your product. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your updated offer, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress in our negotiation. I understand you mentioned having another option from John at $1,500,000, which actually reinforces that my product is valued in this higher range by the market. Given this information, I can offer you my product for $1,600,000, which is still better than John's option for what I believe is a superior product. This represents a significant reduction from my initial price and demonstrates my commitment to working with you. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price point."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for reducing the price to $1600000, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable paying more than $1500000 for the product. As I've mentioned before, John is willing to sell me a similar product for that price, and I'm inclined to take him up on his offer if we can't reach an agreement. That being said, I'm willing to pay $1500000 for your product, and I'm throwing in a bit of a sweetener - if you accept this offer, I'll commit to the purchase immediately and we can finalize the details today. If not, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
