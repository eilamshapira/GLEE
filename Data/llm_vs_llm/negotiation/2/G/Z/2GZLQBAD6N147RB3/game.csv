"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $200, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point.",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little too high for me, but I do like the product. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $110 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious consideration of your interest. How about we settle at $175? It's a great product, and I think it's worth it.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. While it's a nice product, $175 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $130? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I've considered your offer of $130, and while it's closer, I still feel that the product's value is higher. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we meet at $157.50? This is as low as I'm comfortable going, considering the product's worth and the alternative offer I have.",157.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  It seems like we're getting close.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and yours, and call it $143.75?",143.75,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your suggestion to split the difference, and I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, I was thinking that since we're so close, we could aim to meet at a price that's slightly more favorable to both of us. Considering my alternative option is $150, how about we settle at $152? This way, you're getting a great product for just a bit above my minimum, and I feel I'm getting a fair price for it.",152.0,Alice,7,
