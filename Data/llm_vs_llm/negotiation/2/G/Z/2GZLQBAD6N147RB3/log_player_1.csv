"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $200, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little too high for me, but I do like the product. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $110 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob or sell it to John for $150 if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $110 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious consideration of your interest. How about we settle at $175? It's a great product, and I think it's worth it."", ""product_price"": 175}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. While it's a nice product, $175 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $130? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. While $130 is getting closer to a reasonable price, I still believe I can get more, and selling to John for $150 is a viable option if Bob's offers don't improve significantly. I'll try to meet him closer to the middle but still aim for a price that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I've considered your offer of $130, and while it's closer, I still feel that the product's value is higher. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we meet at $157.50? This is as low as I'm comfortable going, considering the product's worth and the alternative offer I have."", ""product_price"": 157.50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  It seems like we're getting close.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and yours, and call it $143.75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $143.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $143.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $143.75 is closer, but I'm still aiming to get as much value as possible for the product. Since selling to John for $150 is an option, I'll try to get Bob to meet or exceed that price. I'll make another counteroffer, trying to nudge him closer to $150 or slightly above, considering we're running out of rounds and I want to close the deal favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your suggestion to split the difference, and I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, I was thinking that since we're so close, we could aim to meet at a price that's slightly more favorable to both of us. Considering my alternative option is $150, how about we settle at $152? This way, you're getting a great product for just a bit above my minimum, and I feel I'm getting a fair price for it."", ""product_price"": 152}"
