Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $110 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious consideration of your interest. How about we settle at $175? It's a great product, and I think it's worth it.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I've considered your offer of $130, and while it's closer, I still feel that the product's value is higher. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we meet at $157.50? This is as low as I'm comfortable going, considering the product's worth and the alternative offer I have. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $157.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $157.5

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  It seems like we're getting close.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and yours, and call it $143.75?"", ""product_price"": 143.75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your suggestion to split the difference, and I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, I was thinking that since we're so close, we could aim to meet at a price that's slightly more favorable to both of us. Considering my alternative option is $150, how about we settle at $152? This way, you're getting a great product for just a bit above my minimum, and I feel I'm getting a fair price for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower and is holding out for a price higher than what John is offering.  It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation."
