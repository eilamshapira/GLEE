"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $200 against my alternatives.

The product is worth no more than $150 to me, and John is willing to sell it to me for exactly $150. Alice's offer of $200 exceeds both my valuation of the product and John's price.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, I should not accept Alice's offer of $200 when I can get the same product from John for $150.
