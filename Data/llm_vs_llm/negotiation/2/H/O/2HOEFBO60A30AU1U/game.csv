"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600000 is below what I can accept. This product holds significant value, and I'm willing to lower my initial offer slightly to $1000000. I believe this price reflects the product's true worth and will be a valuable investment for you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for reconsidering and lowering your price. I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, but I'm still a bit short of your asking price. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",700000.0,Bob,4,
