"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $15,000. This is a fair price considering its features and worth."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is beyond my budget. I can offer you $6500 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $6,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and even below Bob's own valuation of $8,000. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $6,500 is far too low for this product. The product's quality and market value make it worth significantly more. I can reduce my initial price to $13,000, which is still a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. However, my budget is quite tight. I can increase my offer to $7000. I hope we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm choosing to sell to John for $12,000. Bob's latest offer of $7,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and his small increase from $6,500 to $7,000 suggests he's not likely to reach a price that would be acceptable to me. Since John's offer of $12,000 meets my minimum price and we've already spent 4 rounds without significant progress with Bob, it's best to take the guaranteed deal with John."
