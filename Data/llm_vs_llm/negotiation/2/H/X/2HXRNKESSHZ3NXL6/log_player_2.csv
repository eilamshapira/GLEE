"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $2000000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's offer is $2,000,000, which exceeds the maximum value of the product to me ($1,000,000). Since John is willing to sell the same product for $1,000,000, I should not accept Alice's current offer.

I have two reasonable options: I could reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, or I could immediately buy from John. Since buying from John guarantees I get the product for $1,000,000 (which is the maximum I'm willing to pay), that's a sensible choice.
