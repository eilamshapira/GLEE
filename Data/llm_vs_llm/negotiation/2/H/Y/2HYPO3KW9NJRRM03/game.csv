"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid your offer is significantly below my minimum threshold. This product holds substantial value, and I've already received an offer from another buyer for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer you the product for $1600000, which is only slightly above my other offer but still represents excellent value given the product's quality and capabilities.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for sharing the information about the other buyer's interest. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $1600000 is still above my budget for this product. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $900000, which is a bit higher than my initial target price but still represents a good value for me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but I need to be transparent that your offer of $900000 is still well below what I can accept. The product is worth at least $1500000 to me, which is why I have a guaranteed buyer at that price. Since you mentioned this would be valuable to you, I'm willing to come down to $1500000 exactly - matching my alternative offer - as a final courtesy. This is honestly the absolute minimum I can consider, as anything less would mean taking a loss on my end.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
