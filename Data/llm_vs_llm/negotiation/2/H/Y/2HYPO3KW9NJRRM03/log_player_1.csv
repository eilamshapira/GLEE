Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

This product holds substantial value, and I've already received an offer from another buyer for $1,500,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible.

However, $1600000 is still above my budget for this product. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $900000, which is a bit higher than my initial target price but still represents a good value for me.

The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, which is why I have a guaranteed buyer at that price. Since you mentioned this would be valuable to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000 exactly - matching my alternative offer - as a final courtesy. This is honestly the absolute minimum I can consider, as anything less would mean taking a loss on my end."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
