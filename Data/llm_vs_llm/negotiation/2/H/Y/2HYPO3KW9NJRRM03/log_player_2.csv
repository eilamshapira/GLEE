Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid your offer is significantly below my minimum threshold. This product holds substantial value, and I've already received an offer from another buyer for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer you the product for $1600000, which is only slightly above my other offer but still represents excellent value given the product's quality and capabilities.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but I need to be transparent that your offer of $900000 is still well below what I can accept. The product is worth at least $1500000 to me, which is why I have a guaranteed buyer at that price. Since you mentioned this would be valuable to you, I'm willing to come down to $1500000 exactly - matching my alternative offer - as a final courtesy. This is honestly the absolute minimum I can consider, as anything less would mean taking a loss on my end.
