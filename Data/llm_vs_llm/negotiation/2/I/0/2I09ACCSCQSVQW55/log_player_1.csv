Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this high-quality product today. Based on its exceptional features and market value, I'm offering it at $25,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $25000 is significantly above my budget. The market value for similar products is much lower, and I have another seller offering the same product for $15000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm prepared to offer $12500 for the product, which would save me from having to go with the other seller while still giving you a fair sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I can't accept $12,500 as it's below my cost. You mentioned another seller offering a similar product for $15,000, which actually aligns with my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm confident my product offers superior quality and value. I can come down to $21,000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer while reflecting the premium quality I'm providing. If we can meet somewhere in the middle, I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 21000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $21000 is still significantly above what makes financial sense for me. You mentioned that $15000 aligns with your minimum acceptable price, and that's exactly what my alternative option is offering. To make it worth choosing you over my other option, I need a better price. I can offer $14000, which is close to your minimum while giving me a small advantage over my alternative. This seems like a fair middle ground that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
