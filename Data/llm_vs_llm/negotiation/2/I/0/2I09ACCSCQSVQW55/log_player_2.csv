"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this high-quality product today. Based on its exceptional features and market value, I'm offering it at $25000. This is a fair price considering the product's capabilities and the value it will bring to you. I'd be happy to discuss the details of the product if you have any questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is asking for $25,000, which is $10,000 more than what John is offering and more than the product's worth to me ($15,000 max). Since I haven't yet made a counteroffer to Alice, and my goal is to save as much money as possible, I should reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price before possibly going with John's offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $25,000 is significantly above my budget. The market value for similar products is much lower, and I have another seller offering the same product for $15,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm prepared to offer $12,500 for the product, which would save me from having to go with the other seller while still giving you a fair sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I can't accept $12500 as it's below my cost. You mentioned another seller offering a similar product for $15000, which actually aligns with my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm confident my product offers superior quality and value. I can come down to $21000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer while reflecting the premium quality I'm providing. If we can meet somewhere in the middle, I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $21,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $21,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price from $25,000 to $21,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but this is still $6,000 above John's price and above what the product is worth to me. She mentioned that $15,000 aligns with her minimum acceptable price, but then offered $21,000 - this seems contradictory. Since I can get the same product from John for $15,000 (which is my maximum value for it), I should reject this offer and continue negotiating.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $21,000 is still significantly above what makes financial sense for me. You mentioned that $15,000 aligns with your minimum acceptable price, and that's exactly what my alternative option is offering. To make it worth choosing you over my other option, I need a better price. I can offer $14,000, which is close to your minimum while giving me a small advantage over my alternative. This seems like a fair middle ground that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
