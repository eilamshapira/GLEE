"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Looking at Alice's offer, I need to decide if $1,200,000 is a good deal for me.

I know that:
- The product is worth up to $1,500,000 to me
- Alice's offer is $1,200,000
- If I reject Alice, I can buy from John for $1,500,000

Alice's offer saves me $300,000 compared to buying from John. Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and $1,200,000 is less than my maximum valuation of $1,500,000, I should accept Alice's offer.
