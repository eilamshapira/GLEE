"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $1,800,000 because:
1. It's significantly above my maximum value of $1,200,000
2. I have John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 as a backup
3. I can make a counteroffer to Alice and try to negotiate a better price
4. If negotiations with Alice don't work out, I can always go with John's offer"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm offering $1,000,000 because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $1,200,000, giving me room to negotiate upward if necessary
2. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, this offer still allows for potential negotiation
3. Even if Alice rejects this offer, I can gradually increase my price in subsequent rounds while staying below my maximum of $1,200,000
4. I always have John's offer of $1,200,000 as a backup if negotiations with Alice fail"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $1,700,000 because:
1. It's still significantly above my maximum value of $1,200,000
2. While Alice has reduced the price from $1,800,000 to $1,700,000, it's still not close enough to my maximum value
3. I can continue negotiating with another counteroffer
4. John's offer of $1,200,000 remains available and is still better than Alice's current offer
5. There's still room for negotiation since we know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm offering $1,100,000 because:
1. It's a reasonable increase from my previous offer of $1,000,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. It's still below my maximum value of $1,200,000, giving me room for further negotiation if needed
3. While it's below Alice's cost of $1,500,000, it might encourage further negotiation
4. I'm demonstrating gradual movement toward a middle ground
5. I still have John's offer of $1,200,000 as a backup, so I can afford to be strategic in my negotiations"
