"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me (Bob), and Alice's offer of $14,999 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's offer, the logical choice is to buy from John for $8,000. This will save me $6,999 compared to Alice's offer and aligns with my maximum valuation.
