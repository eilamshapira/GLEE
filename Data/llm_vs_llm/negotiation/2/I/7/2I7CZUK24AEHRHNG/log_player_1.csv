Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it for $120. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's $90, since I know the product has good value and Bob is showing genuine interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While I can't go as low as $90, I can reduce my initial price. Given the quality and value of the product, I can offer it to you for $105. This is a fair price that reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $97.50. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $97.50. This is a good price that's well above my minimum threshold of $80, and Bob has shown he's a serious buyer by making a reasonable counteroffer. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether, and this price gives me a better profit than selling to John."
