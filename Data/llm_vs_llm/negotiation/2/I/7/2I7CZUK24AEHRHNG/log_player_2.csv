"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it for $120. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's initial offer is $120, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and I also have the option to buy the product from John for the same price, I don't see any benefit in accepting Alice's offer immediately or buying from John without trying to negotiate a better price with Alice.

Therefore, my decision is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Alice a counteroffer, hoping to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, to see if we can negotiate a better price.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While I can't go as low as $90, I can reduce my initial price. Given the quality and value of the product, I can offer it to you for $105. This is a fair price that reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has reduced the price from $120 to $105, which is a step in the right direction. However, I'm still hoping to get a better deal.

Since $105 is still below my maximum budget of $120, I'll try to negotiate further. I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer, trying to meet somewhere in the middle between my previous offer of $90 and Alice's new offer of $105.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll send a new counteroffer: 

{""message"": ""Thank you for the revised offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $97.50. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?"", ""product_price"": 97.50}"
