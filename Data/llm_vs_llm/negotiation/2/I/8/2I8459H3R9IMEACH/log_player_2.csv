Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer. It makes sense to reject and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

This is a classic negotiation tactic - starting with a low offer that is significantly below your actual budget. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling to Alice that her initial offer was unreasonable."

Alice is getting closer but it's still not a good deal compared to buying from John. We need to encourage her to move closer to our acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

This counteroffer shows movement from our previous offer but still keeps us well below John's offer, while approaching a potentially agreeable middle ground."

Alice is unlikely to move much further and is now only $100,000 cheaper than John. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation, so it's best to buy from John at the guaranteed lower price."
