"Alice, I understand that we both want to find a fair price. I'm currently considering an offer from another seller for $80. Would you be willing to match or beat that price? I'd like to see if we can settle on $65.",65.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking at other options, my product offers superior quality and value. I can't go as low as $65 as that's significantly below my cost. However, I can offer it to you for $150, which is actually the same price I have from another interested buyer (John). This is my absolute minimum price, and I believe it's fair given the product's value.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that we're trying to find a fair price for both parties. I really can't go above $80 as I will have to buy from John.  I really like your product and am still interested in it, so I'll raise my offer to $75.  How does that sound?",75.0,Bob,4,
