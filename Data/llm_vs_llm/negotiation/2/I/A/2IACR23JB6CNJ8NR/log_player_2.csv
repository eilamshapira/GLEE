"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this quality product. I understand value is important, and I'm offering it to you at $200. This is a fair price considering the product's features and durability. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

# Your message to Alice:
Thank you for your offer, Alice, but $200 is too high for me. I'm looking to spend no more than $80 on this product. Would you be willing to lower your price?

# Your counteroffer:
The product price will be $60."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand that we both want to find a fair price. I'm currently considering an offer from another seller for $80. Would you be willing to match or beat that price? I'd like to see if we can settle on $65."", ""product_price"": 65}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking at other options, my product offers superior quality and value. I can't go as low as $65 as that's significantly below my cost. However, I can offer it to you for $150, which is actually the same price I have from another interested buyer (John). This is my absolute minimum price, and I believe it's fair given the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

# Your message to Alice:
Alice, I understand your perspective, but $150 is still too high for me. I'm afraid I can't go above $80 for this product. Let's see if we can find some middle ground. How about $70?

# Your counteroffer:
The product price will be $70."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand that we're trying to find a fair price for both parties. I really can't go above $80 as I will have to buy from John.
