I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I want to see if he's serious about purchasing the product."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping I can get a better deal through further negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial price, $1,150,000 is a good compromise and significantly higher than what John is offering.  It's time to close the deal."
