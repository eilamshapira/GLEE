"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $20000. This is a great opportunity to own something truly valuable. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer against my options. Alice is offering the product for $20,000, but it's only worth $10,000 to me. I have the option to buy from John for $10,000, which matches the product's value to me. Alice's offer is significantly above both my valuation and my alternative option.

Since Alice's offer ($20,000) is much higher than both my maximum valuation ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000), I should either reject and counteroffer or buy from John directly. In this case, there's no reason to negotiate further when I already have a guaranteed option at my maximum value.
