"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate it, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $175.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I understand you want to meet in the middle, but $175 is still a bit high for me. How about we try $110? I think that's a fair price considering my budget.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Alright Bob, I understand your budget. Let's try this again. How about $160? That's the lowest I can go and still feel it's a fair deal.",160.0,Alice,5,

"Thanks for coming down to $160, Alice. However, it's still above what I'm willing to spend. Could you consider $115? I really want to make this work.",115.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your effort to lower the price, but $155 is still too high for me. How about we settle at $118? I think that's a fair compromise given my budget constraints.",118.0,Bob,8,
