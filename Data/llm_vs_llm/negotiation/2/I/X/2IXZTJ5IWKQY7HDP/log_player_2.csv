"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a great product to offer you. I believe it would be valuable for you. I'm willing to sell it for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's offer of $150 is higher than the maximum value I'm willing to pay for the product ($120), and it's also higher than John's price of $120. Since I can buy the exact same product from John for $120, there's no reason for me to accept Alice's higher price.

I could make a counteroffer to Alice, but since I already know I can get the product for $120 from John, I'll just go with that option.
