"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I should evaluate whether to accept Alice's offer of $200, reject it, or buy from John at $100.

Given that:
- The product is worth no more than $100 to me
- John is willing to sell the product for $100
- Alice is offering the same product for $200

This is a straightforward decision. Buying from Alice at $200 would cost me $100 more than the product's maximum value to me. Meanwhile, John's offer matches exactly what the product is worth to me.
