Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a reasonable offer price for Bob. If he rejects my offer, I'll still get $15,000 from John, so that's my fallback.

I don't want to price too high and risk rejection, but I also want to try to get more than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll set a price that's somewhat higher than my minimum but still potentially attractive:

{""product_price"": 22500}"
