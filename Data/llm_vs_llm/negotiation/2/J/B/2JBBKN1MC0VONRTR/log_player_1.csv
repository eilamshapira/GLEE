Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, I believe your initial price is significantly higher than the market value. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell it to me at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $600000 for the product, which gives you a quick sale while saving me from having to go to another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid $600,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. While I value your interest, I also know the unique value this product holds, and that it is worth at least double the amount you are offering. However, to keep negotiations moving, I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial price. My new offer is $1,800,000."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for reducing your price, but $1800000 is still well above what I can justify for this product. I need to be frank - this product is worth no more than $800000 to me, which is exactly what John is offering. However, I'd rather work with you. To demonstrate my seriousness and save us both time, I'll increase my offer to $700000, which is a substantial portion of my maximum budget. This represents a fair price based on my market research and the product's actual value. If we can't get closer in pricing, I'll unfortunately need to accept John's offer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. I understand you have a limit, and I want to be realistic as well. I'm still a ways off from your valuation, but I'm prepared to make another move. How about we meet in the middle *between your offer and my minimum*? My minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000. Therefore, my new offer is $950,000 (the midpoint between your $700,000 and my $1,200,000)."", ""product_price"": 950000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your significant movement in price and your transparency about your position. However, I need to be equally transparent - the absolute maximum this product is worth to me is $800000, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. I cannot justify paying more than the product's value to me. My final offer is $750000. This gives you a slight premium over what I'd pay John, accounting for my preference to work with you. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $800000, I'll have no choice but to go with John's offer, as paying more would result in a loss for me.
