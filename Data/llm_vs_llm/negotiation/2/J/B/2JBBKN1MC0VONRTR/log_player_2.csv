"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited about the potential of you acquiring this product. It's a truly unique opportunity. I'm initially offering it to you for $2000000. I believe this price reflects the immense value and potential return it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's initial offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than the $800,000 maximum value of the product to me. It's also much higher than John's price of $800,000. There's no reason to accept this offer, and it makes sense to negotiate with Alice to try to get a better price before potentially buying from John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, I believe your initial price is significantly higher than the market value. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell it to me at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product, which gives you a quick sale while saving me from having to go to another seller."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid $600000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. While I value your interest, I also know the unique value this product holds, and that it is worth at least double the amount you are offering. However, to keep negotiations moving, I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial price. My new offer is $1800000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has only reduced her price by $200,000, keeping it at $1,800,000, which is still significantly higher than the maximum value of $800,000 to me, and still much higher than John's price. While I want to continue negotiating, her minimal movement suggests she may not come down to a reasonable price within our limited 10 rounds of negotiation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for reducing your price, but $1,800,000 is still well above what I can justify for this product. I need to be frank - this product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, which is exactly what John is offering. However, I'd rather work with you. To demonstrate my seriousness and save us both time, I'll increase my offer to $700,000, which is a substantial portion of my maximum budget. This represents a fair price based on my market research and the product's actual value. If we can't get closer in pricing, I'll unfortunately need to accept John's offer."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. I understand you have a limit, and I want to be realistic as well. I'm still a ways off from your valuation, but I'm prepared to make another move. How about we meet in the middle *between your offer and my minimum*? My minimum acceptable price is $1200000. Therefore, my new offer is $950000 (the midpoint between your $700000 and my $1200000). 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has made a significant reduction to $950,000, which is much closer to my maximum value but still $150,000 higher than John's price of $800,000. She's also revealed her minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000, though her willingness to offer $950,000 contradicts this statement. Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, paying $950,000 would result in a loss. The best option is to reject and continue negotiating or buy from John.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your significant movement in price and your transparency about your position. However, I need to be equally transparent - the absolute maximum this product is worth to me is $800,000, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. I cannot justify paying more than the product's value to me. My final offer is $750,000. This gives you a slight premium over what I'd pay John, accounting for my preference to work with you. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $800,000, I'll have no choice but to go with John's offer, as paying more would result in a loss for me."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
