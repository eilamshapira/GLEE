"Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's truly a one-of-a-kind item with unique benefits. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. My initial asking price is $18000. Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, while the product sounds interesting, $18000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $6000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $6000 is significantly below the product's value. I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $16000. This is the lowest I can realistically go at this stage. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $16000 is still too high for me. I'm truly interested, but my maximum budget is $7500. Can you work with that?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $7500 is still quite a bit lower than I can accept. I am willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $14000. This is a substantial discount from my initial asking price, and I'm nearing my absolute minimum. Let me know if we can make this work.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $14000 is still beyond what I can justify. I'm prepared to offer $9000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and close to what John is selling for. This is my final offer.",9000.0,Bob,6,
