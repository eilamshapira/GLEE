Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I believe $900000 is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. I look forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is higher than John's offer of $800,000, but still lower than the product's value to Bob and my initial offer, I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price. 

My counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad we can continue the discussion.
