"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1500000. I'm confident that this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is higher than both my maximum valuation ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), this is not a good deal. While I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, since John's price is exactly at my maximum valuation and I know it's guaranteed, it makes sense to take that option rather than risk further negotiations.
