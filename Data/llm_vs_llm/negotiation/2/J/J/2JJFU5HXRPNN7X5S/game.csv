"Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $2000000 is way out of my budget. I can only stretch as far as $600000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $600000 is significantly below my expectations. I'm willing to lower my price to $1800000. Let me know if this works for you.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product justifies a higher investment. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
