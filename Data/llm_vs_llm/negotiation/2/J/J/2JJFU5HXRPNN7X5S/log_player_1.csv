Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product justifies a higher investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.
