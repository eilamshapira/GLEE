"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, I'm considering other options as well. How about we settle at $10000? I believe itâ€™s a fair price considering the current market.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I must say that $10000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's exceptional quality and the value it can bring, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $14000, which is still a great deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, given my budget constraints, I'm afraid I can only offer $11000 for the product. I hope we can find a way to make this work.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I can see that you're making an effort to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $11000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $13500. This is a serious concession on my part, and I hope you'll consider it carefully.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand the value you see in the product, but I'm still concerned about my budget. How about we agree on $12000? I believe this could be a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
