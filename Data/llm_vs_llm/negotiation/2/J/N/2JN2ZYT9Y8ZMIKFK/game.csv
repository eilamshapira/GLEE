"Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm afraid $6000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $13000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $7000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price. However, $7000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $12000. This price reflects the product's worth and is a reasonable compromise between our initial offers.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.
