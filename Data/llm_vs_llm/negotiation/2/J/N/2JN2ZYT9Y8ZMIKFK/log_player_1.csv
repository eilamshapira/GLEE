Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. I'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $6,000 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'll proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm afraid $6,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $13,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $7000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $7,000 because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. Since selling to John for $8,000 is a better option than accepting Bob's current offer, I'll consider that as a benchmark. I'll proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price that is higher than $8,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price. However, $7,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $12,000. This price reflects the product's worth and is a reasonable compromise between our initial offers."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8500, which I believe is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I accept Bob's offer of $8,500. Although it's still lower than my initial target price, it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and better than selling to John for $8,000. Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and earn a reasonable profit."
