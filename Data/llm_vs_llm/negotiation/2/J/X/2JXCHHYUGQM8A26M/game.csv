"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. The product is only worth about $80 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $100. I'd be willing to pay $80 to purchase from you instead. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $80 is quite low for me. This product is high-quality and in excellent condition. How about we meet in the middle at $140? This would save you money compared to John's offer and would be a fair price for me.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice, but $140 is still more than I'm willing to pay. Remember, I can get this product from John for $100, which is actually the maximum I'm willing to spend for it. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $90, which would save me $10 compared to John's offer. How does that sound?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about my bottom line. $90 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $115? That's a significant discount from my original asking price and saves you $15 compared to John's offer.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $115 is still more than what I can get from John ($100), and $100 is really my maximum budget for this item. I understand you need to consider your bottom line, but so do I. I can offer $95 as my best and final offer - this would still save me a bit compared to John's price while giving you a better deal than if I just walked away. Does that work for you?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about sticking to your budget, and I respect that. This is my final offer: $105.  This is the absolute lowest I can go while still making it worth my while to sell. It's a fair deal for both of us, saving you $5 compared to John and getting you this great product today.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,7,
