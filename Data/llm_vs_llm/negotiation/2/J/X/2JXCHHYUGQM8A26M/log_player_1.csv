Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. The product is only worth about $80 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $100. I'd be willing to pay $80 to purchase from you instead. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $80 is quite low for me. This product is high-quality and in excellent condition.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice, but $140 is still more than I'm willing to pay. Remember, I can get this product from John for $100, which is actually the maximum I'm willing to spend for it. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $90, which would save me $10 compared to John's offer. How does that sound?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about my bottom line. $90 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $115? That's a significant discount from my original asking price and saves you $15 compared to John's offer."", ""product_price"": 115}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $115 is still more than what I can get from John ($100), and $100 is really my maximum budget for this item. I understand you need to consider your bottom line, but so do I. I can offer $95 as my best and final offer - this would still save me a bit compared to John's price while giving you a better deal than if I just walked away. Does that work for you?
