"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but $14500 is quite close to what I can get elsewhere. Given the market conditions, I'd be comfortable purchasing the product for $12800. This represents good value for both of us. What do you think?",12800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your perspective, $12800 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. How about we meet in the middle at $13800?",13800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I can see we're making progress. However, $13800 is still a bit high for my budget. I can go up to $13200, which I believe is fair and gives you a good margin while helping me stay within my constraints. Does that work for you?",13200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close! $13200 is tempting. Let's try $13500. That's my absolute lowest.",13500.0,Alice,5,
