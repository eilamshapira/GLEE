"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm delighted you're interested in the product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm offering it to you for $14500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering me the product for $14,500, but I know it's worth only $12,000 to her, so there's room for negotiation. I can also buy from John at $15,000, but that's my absolute maximum and would leave me with no savings.

Since the product is worth up to $15,000 to me, Alice's offer of $14,500 would save me $500 compared to buying from John. However, I should try to negotiate a better price with Alice first, as there's a $2,500 gap between her cost ($12,000) and her offer ($14,500).

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your perspective, $12800 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. How about we meet in the middle at $13800? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down from her initial $14,500 to $13,800, which is a good step in the right direction. This would save me $1,200 compared to John's price of $15,000. However, there's still room for negotiation since I know the product is worth $12,000 to Alice.

I should continue negotiating to try to get a better price, as we haven't reached an impasse yet.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I can see we're making progress. However, $13,800 is still a bit high for my budget. I can go up to $13,200, which I believe is fair and gives you a good margin while helping me stay within my constraints. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 13200}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close! $13200 is tempting. Let's try $13500. That's my absolute lowest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has now come down to $13,500 and called it her ""absolute lowest"" price. This is a good offer that would save me $1,500 compared to John's price of $15,000. 

While I could try to push for an even lower price, Alice has already reduced her price by $1,000 from her initial offer, and she's indicating this is her final price point. The $13,500 represents a good compromise - it's $1,500 below my maximum value and gives Alice a $1,500 profit from her cost of $12,000.

Given that we're converging and this represents a fair deal for both of us, I'll accept this offer.
