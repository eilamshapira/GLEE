"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $25000.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a more reasonable budget. How about we consider a price of $10000 for the product?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I must say that $10000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's value and the initial price I offered, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you the product for $22000, which is a significant reduction from the original price. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations.",22000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I am still looking for a price that fits my budget. How about we settle for $8000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I must say that $8000 is still too low for me to consider. I've already made a significant concession from the original price, and I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm still interested in finding a mutually beneficial agreement. I can offer you the product for $20000, which is another reduction from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",20000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, my budget is still quite limited. I would like to propose a price of $7000 for the product. Would you consider this?",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but I must say that $7000 is still not a viable option for me. I've made several concessions already, and I'm starting to approach the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had, I can offer you the product for $18000. This is a significant reduction from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If we can't meet in the middle, I may need to consider other options.",18000.0,Alice,7,
