"Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to make a decision about Alice's offer of $160 for the product.

Looking at my options:
1. Accepting Alice's offer would cost me $160
2. Making a counteroffer to Alice might get me a better price
3. Buying from John would cost $120

Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and John is offering it for exactly $120, Alice's price of $160 is clearly too high. There's no reason for me to pay $40 more than the product is worth to me, especially when I have a guaranteed option to get it at $120.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice that reflects the product's value to me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has reduced her offer from $160 to $140, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still higher than the $120 that John is offering, and since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, I should either try to negotiate further with Alice or just buy from John.

Since John is offering a guaranteed price of $120, and Alice is still asking for more than that, the rational choice is to either make another counteroffer to Alice to see if she'll go below $120, or just buy from John right now.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer to Alice that's below John's price, giving her a chance to beat the alternative option I have.
