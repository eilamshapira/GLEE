"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to make a decision based on Alice's offer of $120 for the product.

Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and I can buy the same product from John for exactly $80, there's no reason for me to accept Alice's much higher offer of $120.

I could make a counteroffer to Alice, but since I already have a guaranteed option to buy at $80 from John, and the product is only worth $80 to me, the most rational decision is to simply buy from John.
