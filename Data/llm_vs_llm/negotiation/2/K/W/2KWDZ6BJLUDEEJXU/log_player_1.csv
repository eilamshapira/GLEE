Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth at least $800,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $800,000
3. Bob's valuation is unknown, but if he values it higher, I should try to capture that value
4. Since I have a safety net of $800,000, I can make a higher offer

I'll make a significantly higher offer to Bob, as I have nothing to lose given my guaranteed backup option.
