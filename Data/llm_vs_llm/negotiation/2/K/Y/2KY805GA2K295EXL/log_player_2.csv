"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Here's my decision-making process:

*   **My Valuation:** The product is worth $150 to me.
*   **Alice's Offer:** $140.
*   **Buying from John:** $150.

Since Alice's offer of $140 is less than what the product is worth to me ($150) and also less than the cost of buying from John ($150), I should accept Alice's offer.
