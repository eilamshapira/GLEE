"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is well above my budget for this product. Given market conditions and comparable products, I would be willing to offer $1000000. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. What are your thoughts on this?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $1000000 is the absolute minimum value of this product, and I have other interested parties at this price point. Given the product's exceptional value and market potential, I can reduce my initial asking price to $1750000, which represents a significant reduction from my original offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a compelling opportunity. Would you consider this revised offer?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1750000 is still above my budget. Given that you mentioned $1000000 as a minimum value, I can offer $1200000. This represents a 20% increase from your stated minimum value and would be a fair deal for both parties.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
