"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its unique features and market value, I'm offering it at $2,500,000. This is a premium product with significant potential value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is well above my budget for this product. Given market conditions and comparable products, I would be willing to offer $1000000. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. What are your thoughts on this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll respond with a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer matches John's backup offer, but since Bob engaged in negotiation, there might be room to secure a better price. The fact that Bob didn't outright dismiss the possibility of a higher price suggests some flexibility in his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $1,000,000 is the absolute minimum value of this product, and I have other interested parties at this price point. Given the product's exceptional value and market potential, I can reduce my initial asking price to $1,750,000, which represents a significant reduction from my original offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a compelling opportunity. Would you consider this revised offer?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1750000 is still above my budget. Given that you mentioned $1000000 as a minimum value, I can offer $1200000. This represents a 20% increase from your stated minimum value and would be a fair deal for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,200,000. This is a reasonable outcome because:
1. It's $200,000 more than John's guaranteed offer
2. We've seen Bob's negotiation pattern and it suggests this might be close to his maximum
3. With only 6 rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away, leaving us with only John's lower offer
4. The 20% increase over the minimum value represents a meaningful improvement over our fallback option"
