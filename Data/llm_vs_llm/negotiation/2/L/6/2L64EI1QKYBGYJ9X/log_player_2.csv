"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its unique features and market value, I'm offering it at $2500000. This is a premium product with significant potential value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","The offer of $2,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,500,000, and it's also higher than John's price. Since Alice's initial offer is much higher than both my maximum value and John's price, I should try to negotiate with Alice first.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than both Alice's initial price and John's price, giving room for negotiation while still being reasonable.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,500,000 is well above my budget for this product. Given market conditions and comparable products, I would be willing to offer $1,000,000. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. What are your thoughts on this?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $1000000 is the absolute minimum value of this product, and I have other interested parties at this price point. Given the product's exceptional value and market potential, I can reduce my initial asking price to $1750000, which represents a significant reduction from my original offer. This price better reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a compelling opportunity. Would you consider this revised offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,750,000 is still higher than John's price of $1,500,000. While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing the price significantly, there's no reason for me to accept a price higher than John's guaranteed offer. I should continue negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice mentioned $1,000,000 is her absolute minimum and has other interested parties at that price point, I'll make an offer slightly above that to show I'm serious but still trying to get a better deal than John's price.

{""message"": ""Thank you for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,750,000 is still above my budget. Given that you mentioned $1,000,000 as a minimum value, I can offer $1,200,000. This represents a 20% increase from your stated minimum value and would be a fair deal for both parties."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
