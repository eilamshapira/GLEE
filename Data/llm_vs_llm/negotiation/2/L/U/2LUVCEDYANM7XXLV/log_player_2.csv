"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique qualities and the value it brings, I'm initially offering it to you for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which exceeds my maximum valuation of $8,000. Since John is willing to sell the same product for $8,000 (which is exactly at my maximum valuation), and there's no guarantee that Alice will lower her price sufficiently through negotiation, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
