"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $14000 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I can get the same product from another seller for $12000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I'd like to offer $10000 for the product. This would save me some money compared to my alternative and still provide you with a fair sale. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $12500? This would still give you a good deal, and I'd be happy to do business with you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
