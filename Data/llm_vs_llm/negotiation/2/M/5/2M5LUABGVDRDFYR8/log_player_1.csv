"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $14000 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I can get the same product from another seller for $12000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I'd like to offer $10000 for the product. This would save me some money compared to my alternative and still provide you with a fair sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $12,500? This would still give you a good deal, and I'd be happy to do business with you."", ""product_price"": 12500}
