"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I should consider my options carefully. Alice is offering the product for $14,000, but it's only worth up to $12,000 to me. I know I can buy the same product from John for $12,000 at any time. Since Alice's offer exceeds my maximum value, I should reject it and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $14,000 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I can get the same product from another seller for $12,000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I'd like to offer $10,000 for the product. This would save me some money compared to my alternative and still provide you with a fair sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $12500? This would still give you a good deal, and I'd be happy to do business with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to make a smart decision here. Alice has lowered her price to $12,500, which is better but still exceeds my alternative option. I can buy from John for $12,000, which is $500 less than Alice's current offer. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible while purchasing the product, and Alice's offer is still above my alternative, I should either reject or go with John.
