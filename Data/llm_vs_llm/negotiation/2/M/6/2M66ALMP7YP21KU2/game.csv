"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2000000 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to pay. I should mention that I can purchase this same product from another seller, John, for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer you $1300000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to John's price while still giving you a reasonable deal. Let me know if this works for you.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your willingness to do business with me, $1300000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I am willing to lower my price to $1800000, which still represents a significant value for the product. Please let me know if this revised offer works for you.",1800000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"Thank you for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate, but $1800000 is still substantially higher than my alternative option. As I mentioned, John is offering the identical product for $1500000, which is my absolute maximum budget. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price than that. I can offer you $1400000, which would be a fair deal for both of us - you make a sale, and I save compared to my alternative option. Does this work for you?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $1400000 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway and reduce the price to $1650000. This price is still competitive and reflects the high value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",1650000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be straightforward with you - I can purchase this exact product from John for $1500000, which is already my maximum budget for this item. If you truly want to make this sale, you would need to offer a price below what John is charging. My final offer is $1450000. This gives you a chance to complete the sale while giving me a small savings compared to my alternative. If this doesn't work for you, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $1450000 is still not feasible for me. I'm willing to go down to $1550000, which is very close to your maximum budget and still allows you to save compared to John's offer. This is my final counteroffer. Please let me know if you can accept this price.",1550000.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
