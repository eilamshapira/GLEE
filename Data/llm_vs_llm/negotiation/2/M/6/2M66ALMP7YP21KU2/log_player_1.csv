Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2000000 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to pay. I should mention that I can purchase this same product from another seller, John, for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer you $1300000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to John's price while still giving you a reasonable deal. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate, but $1800000 is still substantially higher than my alternative option. As I mentioned, John is offering the identical product for $1500000, which is my absolute maximum budget. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price than that. I can offer you $1400000, which would be a fair deal for both of us - you make a sale, and I save compared to my alternative option. Does this work for you?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to be straightforward with you - I can purchase this exact product from John for $1500000, which is already my maximum budget for this item. If you truly want to make this sale, you would need to offer a price below what John is charging. My final offer is $1450000. This gives you a chance to complete the sale while giving me a small savings compared to my alternative. If this doesn't work for you, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.
