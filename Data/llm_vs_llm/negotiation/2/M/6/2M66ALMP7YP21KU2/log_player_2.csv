"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $2000000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something of great value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I notice that Alice is offering the product for $2,000,000, which is $500,000 more than what it's worth to me ($1,500,000) and also $500,000 more than what I can buy it from John for.

Since Alice's initial offer exceeds both my maximum value and John's guaranteed price, the rational choice is to either reject and make a counteroffer or go directly to John.

Given that John is willing to sell the product for $1,500,000, which is exactly my maximum value for the product, and Alice's initial offer is significantly higher, I'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate.

To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price than that.
