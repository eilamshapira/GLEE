"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to compare the offers and make a decision based on the value of the product to me.

Alice is offering the product for $20,000, which exceeds the maximum value of $10,000 that the product is worth to me.

John is offering the same product for $10,000, which is exactly the maximum value the product is worth to me.

Since Alice's offer ($20,000) is higher than John's offer ($10,000), and my goal is to save as much money as possible while still getting the product, the logical choice is to buy from John.
