"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $200 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $120, and also higher than John's price. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer significantly lower than John's price to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be unreasonable.

{""product_price"": 80}

This offer is reasonable because:
1. It's below John's price of $120
2. It leaves room for negotiation upward
3. It signals to Alice that her initial offer of $200 was too high
4. If Alice counters with a price closer to $120, I could potentially accept it if it's below $120"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $180 is still significantly higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120). While she did reduce the price from $200 to $180, it's not enough to make it a better deal than John's offer. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 95}

I'll slightly increase my previous offer of $80 to show willingness to negotiate, but still maintain a price well below John's price of $120. This way:
1. I demonstrate flexibility and good faith in negotiation
2. I maintain a price point that would give me better value than John's offer
3. I leave room for further negotiation while moving closer to a middle ground
4. If Alice continues to counter with very high prices, I can always fall back on John's offer of $120"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $150 is still above both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120). While she's showing movement in the right direction (from $180 to $150), it's still not competitive with John's offer. Given that we're halfway through our negotiation rounds and Alice is still significantly above John's price, I'll reject and make one more counteroffer. If we can't get closer to a reasonable price soon, I may need to take John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 105}

I'm increasing my offer to $105 to show continued willingness to negotiate and to bridge the gap. This price:
1. Is still below John's price of $120
2. Shows significant movement from my previous offer of $95
3. Demonstrates I'm serious about making a deal
4. Leaves room for one final negotiation if needed
5. Is still within my maximum value of $120

If Alice doesn't respond with a price at or below $120 in the next round, I should strongly consider taking John's offer, as we're running out of negotiation rounds."
