"Hello Alice, thanks for offering! While I appreciate the quality, the price is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? I think that's fair given the market value.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $100 is below what I can accept for this item. The quality and value of this product is significant, and my bottom line is $140. This is already a reduction from my initial offer and represents good value for what you're getting. Would this work for you?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still more than I'd like to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",120.0,Bob,4,
