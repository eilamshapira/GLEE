"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price seems quite high to me. I'm interested, but I'd need to see a more realistic figure.  How about we start the conversation at $500000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you, Bob, for your offer. I understand that the initial price might seem high, but I assure you that the product's value is substantial. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure that the price reflects its true worth. Considering your offer, I'd like to propose a middle ground.",2500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $2500000 is still much higher than what I'm comfortable with. To be frank, anything above $1000000 is going to be a very tough sell for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
