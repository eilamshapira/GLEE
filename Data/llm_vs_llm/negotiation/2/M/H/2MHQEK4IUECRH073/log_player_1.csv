"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a competitive price, considering the product's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price seems quite high to me. I'm interested, but I'd need to see a more realistic figure.  How about we start the conversation at $500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $500,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me, and I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a more satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you, Bob, for your offer. I understand that the initial price might seem high, but I assure you that the product's value is substantial. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure that the price reflects its true worth. Considering your offer, I'd like to propose a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $2500000 is still much higher than what I'm comfortable with. To be frank, anything above $1000000 is going to be a very tough sell for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches the minimum value I have for the product and is also the same amount I could get from selling to John, it seems like a reasonable compromise. Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better offer, and accepting this offer ensures I meet my minimum requirement."
