"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that Bob values the product at $100 and my minimum acceptable price is $150, and I have John's guaranteed offer of $150, I should start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation, but not so high as to immediately discourage Bob.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer of $70 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and it's even well below his own valuation of $100. This suggests he's not negotiating in good faith. Given that I have a guaranteed offer from John at $150, and Bob's lowball offer indicates difficult negotiations ahead, the rational choice is to sell to John.
