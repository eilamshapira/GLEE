"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the current market conditions and my budget. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand your budget considerations, $1200000 is actually my absolute minimum threshold for this item based on its inherent value and production costs. I'm willing to meet you in the middle with a more reasonable price of $1500000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of this premium product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
