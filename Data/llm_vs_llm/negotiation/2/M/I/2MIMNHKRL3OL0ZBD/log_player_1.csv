Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the current market conditions and my budget. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand your budget considerations, $1,200,000 is actually my absolute minimum threshold for this item based on its inherent value and production costs. I'm willing to meet you in the middle with a more reasonable price of $1,500,000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of this premium product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
