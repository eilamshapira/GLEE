Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand your budget considerations, $1200000 is actually my absolute minimum threshold for this item based on its inherent value and production costs. I'm willing to meet you in the middle with a more reasonable price of $1500000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of this premium product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
