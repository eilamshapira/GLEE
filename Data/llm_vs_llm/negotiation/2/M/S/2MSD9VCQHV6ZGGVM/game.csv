"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, I believe $950000 is a bit on the higher side for my budget. Considering the importance and interest I have in acquiring it, I would like to offer $750000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value to me while allowing us both to reach a satisfactory agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $750000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept, considering the true value of this product. I'm prepared to meet you closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to lower my price to $900000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, Alice. However, $900000 is still beyond what I'm prepared to spend, especially given other options available to me at $800000. How about we settle at $800000? I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your offer. However, this product is truly unique, and I believe it's worth a premium. Considering the current market, $800000 is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. I am prepared to sell it for $850000.",850000.0,Alice,5,
