"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, I believe $950000 is a bit on the higher side for my budget. Considering the importance and interest I have in acquiring it, I would like to offer $750000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value to me while allowing us both to reach a satisfactory agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. I need to get a price above $800,000 to even consider it, and I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $750,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept, considering the true value of this product. I'm prepared to meet you closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to lower my price to $900,000."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, Alice. However, $900000 is still beyond what I'm prepared to spend, especially given other options available to me at $800000. How about we settle at $800000? I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

I'm going to take a gamble and try to get a little more.
