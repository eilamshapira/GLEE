Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. 

Since I know I can definitely get $150 from John, that's my safety net. Bob's valuation is unknown, but if it's higher than $150, I should try to capture some of that additional value.

I'll set a price significantly above $150, but not so high that it would likely deter most reasonable buyers. Around $225 seems like a good balance - if Bob values the product higher than that, I'll make a good profit, and if he rejects it, I still have my guaranteed $150 from John.
