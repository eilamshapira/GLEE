"Alice's offer: The product price will be $225. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $225
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $80 to me
2. Alice's offer is $225 (which is significantly higher than my maximum value)
3. John offers the same product for $80 (which matches my maximum value)

The logical choice is to buy from John, as it will save me $145 compared to Alice's offer and matches my maximum valuation of the product.
