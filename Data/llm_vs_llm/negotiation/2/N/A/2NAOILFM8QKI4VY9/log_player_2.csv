"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since the current offer from Alice is $13,000, which is above both the $10,000 price from John and above the product's worth to me ($10,000), I should not accept this offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round where I can make a counteroffer. This gives me a chance to negotiate a better price with Alice before deciding whether to buy from John.

Since we're now in round 7 of 10, I'll continue to reject her offers and either try to get a price below $10,000 from Alice or ultimately buy from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","We're getting closer to the end of our negotiation rounds, so I'll make a more substantial increase in my offer while still keeping it below John's price.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's offer of $11,900 is still higher than John's price of $10,000 and above what the product is worth to me. We're now at round 9 of 10, and Alice hasn't come down to a price that would be better than John's alternative. At this point, it's clear that we're not likely to reach an agreement below $10,000.

Since we only have one round left after this, and Alice's offers have consistently been above $10,000, I'll choose to buy from John instead of continuing this negotiation.
