Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my offer to Bob. 

The product is worth $1,000,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay exactly that amount.

The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, meaning he will not accept any offer above this amount. Since my minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000, and Bob values it at only $800,000, there is no price that would be acceptable to both of us.

If I offer any price above $800,000, Bob will reject it. If I offer any price below $1,000,000, I would be losing money compared to selling to John.

The rational decision is to make an offer that Bob will reject, allowing me to proceed with selling to John for the full $1,000,000.
