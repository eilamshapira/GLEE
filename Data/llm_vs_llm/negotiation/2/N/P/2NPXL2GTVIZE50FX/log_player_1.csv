Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2,500,000. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm open to negotiations if you have a different valuation in mind."", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but the price is significantly higher than what I am willing to pay. I am looking for a price that is no more than $1200000. Would you be willing to negotiate within this range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is lower than what John is willing to pay ($1,500,000), and it's also lower than the product's value to me, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better price. My next offer will be lower than my initial offer but still higher than John's offer, to leave room for negotiation.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $2,000,000. This price reflects the product's true value while considering your budget constraints. I'm open to further negotiations if needed."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand your perspective, $2000000 is still quite high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $800000 to meet you in the middle. Would you be open to this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Since Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than what John is willing to pay ($1,500,000) and the product's value to me, I will reject Bob's offer. However, I still want to try to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob. This time, I will lower my price to try to meet Bob halfway between his offer and John's offer.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to raise your offer, but $800,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,800,000, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
