"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $12,000, and also higher than John's price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer significantly below John's price to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be unreasonable.

{""product_price"": 8000}

This offer is reasonable because:
1. It's well below John's price of $12,000, giving room for negotiation
2. It shows I'm serious about making a deal but also want a good value
3. If Alice rejects, we still have several rounds to negotiate and potentially meet at a middle ground"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $18,000 is still significantly higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000). While Alice has reduced the price from the initial $20,000, it's still not competitive with my alternative option. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round to try to reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still stay well below John's price to maintain negotiating room.

{""product_price"": 9500}

This offer is reasonable because:
1. It shows movement from my previous offer of $8,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate
2. It's still comfortably below John's price of $12,000
3. It gives Alice room to counter while keeping the final price potentially below John's option
4. If Alice doesn't accept, we still have several rounds to negotiate further"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $12,000. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($16,000) is still significantly above John's price ($12,000)
2. After several rounds of negotiation, Alice's price reductions have been relatively small (from $20,000 to $18,000 to $16,000)
3. The pattern suggests Alice is unlikely to drop the price below John's $12,000 in the remaining rounds
4. Since $12,000 is also my maximum value for the product, John's price is the most sensible option"
