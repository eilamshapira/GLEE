"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, the price of $1900000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only consider it at a significantly lower price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000, which I believe is more in line with my needs and budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800000 is significantly below the product's true value and my bottom line. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the product's worth. I'm willing to come down to $1650000, which is already a substantial reduction from my initial offer. This price better reflects the quality and value you'll receive. Let me know your thoughts.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price to $1650000. However, it's still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but I'm afraid we're still quite far apart. While I understand you have budget considerations, I also need to ensure I'm getting fair value for this product. Given that I have an alternative buyer at $1200000, I can't go below that price. However, I value our potential business relationship and would be willing to meet you at $1350000, which is significantly lower than my initial offer. This represents excellent value for the quality you'll receive.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your transparency about the alternative buyer and your willingness to lower the price. However, $1350000 is still above my budget. Given that you mentioned an alternative buyer at $1200000, I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, which is slightly above my initial budget but still a compromise. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and our potential business relationship.",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your continued interest and for increasing your offer. I genuinely appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, as I mentioned, I have a firm offer from another buyer at $1200000, which is my absolute minimum acceptable price. I cannot sell below this amount as it would be a financial loss for me. If you're able to meet me at $1220000, which is just slightly above my minimum threshold, I'd be happy to proceed with you rather than the other buyer. This represents my final price point, and I hope we can close the deal.",1220000.0,Alice,7,
