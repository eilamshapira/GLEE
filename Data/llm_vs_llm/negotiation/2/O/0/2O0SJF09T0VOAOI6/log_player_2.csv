Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800000 is significantly below the product's true value and my bottom line. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the product's worth. I'm willing to come down to $1650000, which is already a substantial reduction from my initial offer. This price better reflects the quality and value you'll receive. Let me know your thoughts.

Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 950000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but I'm afraid we're still quite far apart. While I understand you have budget considerations, I also need to ensure I'm getting fair value for this product. Given that I have an alternative buyer at $1200000, I can't go below that price. However, I value our potential business relationship and would be willing to meet you at $1350000, which is significantly lower than my initial offer. This represents excellent value for the quality you'll receive.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your transparency about the alternative buyer and your willingness to lower the price. However, $1,350,000 is still above my budget. Given that you mentioned an alternative buyer at $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is slightly above my initial budget but still a compromise.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your continued interest and for increasing your offer. I genuinely appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, as I mentioned, I have a firm offer from another buyer at $1200000, which is my absolute minimum acceptable price. I cannot sell below this amount as it would be a financial loss for me. If you're able to meet me at $1220000, which is just slightly above my minimum threshold, I'd be happy to proceed with you rather than the other buyer. This represents my final price point, and I hope we can close the deal.
