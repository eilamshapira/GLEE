"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire this incredible product. Given its rarity and importance, I'm prepared to let it go for $1900000. What do you say?",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that's a very generous offer, but I'm not sure I can justify that price.  Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to pay $1200000. Let's see if we can find some common ground there.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it. However, I need to be realistic about the value of this product. Considering its exceptional qualities, I can come down a little, but not that much. How about $1800000? That's my final offer.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1800000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1500000? I'm confident we can make this work if we're both willing to be flexible.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you a bit, but I can't go down to $1500000. How about $1700000? This is the lowest I can realistically go and still make this worthwhile for me. This is my absolute final offer.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
