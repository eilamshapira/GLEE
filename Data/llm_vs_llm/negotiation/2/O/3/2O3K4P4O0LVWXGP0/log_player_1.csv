Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire this incredible product. Given its rarity and importance, I'm prepared to let it go for $1,900,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a very generous offer, but I'm not sure I can justify that price.  Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to pay $1200000. Let's see if we can find some common ground there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Okay, I need to make a decision. I can't accept $1,200,000 â€“ that's too close to what I *have* to get from John.

So my choices are to counteroffer or sell to John. I'll try to push the price up a bit more.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it. However, I need to be realistic about the value of this product. Considering its exceptional qualities, I can come down a little, but not that much. How about $1,800,000? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1800000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1500000? I'm confident we can make this work if we're both willing to be flexible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Okay, this is getting tricky. $1,500,000 is a decent profit, but I'm still trying to get the highest possible price. I have to weigh the risk of losing Bob altogether against the potential of getting a better offer. Given the current offer, and my need for at least $1,000,000, I can either accept or reject.

I'll try one more counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired amount.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here's my next counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you a bit, but I can't go down to $1,500,000. How about $1,700,000? This is the lowest I can realistically go and still make this worthwhile for me. This is my absolute final offer."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
