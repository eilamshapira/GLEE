"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is significantly above my maximum value of $1,200,000. It would not be rational to accept an offer of $1,800,000 when I can buy from John for $1,200,000. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a more reasonable price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is below John's price of $1,200,000 and also below Alice's cost of $1,500,000, giving room for negotiation. If Alice rejects this, I can gradually increase my offer, but I'll always have John's offer of $1,200,000 as a backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,600,000 is still well above my maximum value of $1,200,000, and it's also higher than John's offer. While Alice has reduced her price from the initial $1,800,000, it's still not acceptable. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round. If we can't reach an agreement soon, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1150000}

I'm slightly increasing my previous offer to $1,150,000. This is still below both John's price ($1,200,000) and Alice's cost ($1,500,000), but shows some movement toward meeting in the middle. However, I won't go above $1,200,000 as that's my maximum value and I have John's offer as a guaranteed alternative at that price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($1,550,000) is still significantly above my maximum value ($1,200,000)
2. Alice has only made small reductions in price (from $1,800,000 to $1,600,000 to $1,550,000)
3. Given that Alice's cost is $1,500,000, it's unlikely she'll go below that
4. We've gone through several rounds without reaching a mutually beneficial price
5. John's offer of $1,200,000 is right at my maximum value

Rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to result in a better deal, it's best to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000."
