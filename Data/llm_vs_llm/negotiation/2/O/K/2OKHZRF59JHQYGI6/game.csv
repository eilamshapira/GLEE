"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $180.  This product is really worth it.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $180 is still too high for me. How about we settle at $70? I think that's a fair price considering my budget constraints.",70.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go below $160. This is my final offer.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $160 is still beyond what I can afford. Could you consider $75? It's a bit higher than my last offer, but it's the most I can stretch my budget.",75.0,Bob,6,
