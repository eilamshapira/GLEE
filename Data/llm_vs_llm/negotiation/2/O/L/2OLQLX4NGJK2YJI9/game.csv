"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $25000 is far beyond what I can invest in this product. I'm serious about buying and can close the deal now if you're willing to sell at $7000. Let me know if this works for you.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7000 is far too low for this product. As I mentioned, its value is substantial. I'm willing to be flexible, but I also need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet in the middle and settle on $22000?",22000.0,Alice,3,
