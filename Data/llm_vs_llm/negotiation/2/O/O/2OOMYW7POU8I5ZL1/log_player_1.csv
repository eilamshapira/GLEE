"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair price."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate you being open to negotiation.  $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  How about we split the difference and I offer you $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to counteroffer since $100 is still a bit lower than I'd like, and I have the option to sell to John for $80 if the negotiation doesn't go well. Let's see if we can meet in the middle or closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $100. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of meeting in the middle of my initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we settle at $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
