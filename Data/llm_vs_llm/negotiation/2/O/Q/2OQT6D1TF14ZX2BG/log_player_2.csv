"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its features and value, I'm offering it for $300. This product is in excellent condition and well worth the investment. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to make a decision about Alice's offer of $300 for the product. Since:

1) The product is worth no more than $100 to me
2) John is willing to sell me the same product for $100
3) Alice's offer of $300 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's alternative

The logical choice is to buy from John instead of accepting Alice's expensive offer or continuing a negotiation that starts from such a high price point.
