"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product sounds interesting, $2000000 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $800000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but the lowest I can go at this point is $1500000. I believe this product will bring significant value to you, and this price reflects that value while also being a considerable reduction from my initial offer.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. $1500000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with, especially considering I have another option available to me. How about we meet in the middle at $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Given the value of the product, I'm prepared to lower my price further to $1250000. This is a fair compromise, considering the benefits the product will offer you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
