"Alice, $190 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 at this point. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $80, I'm afraid that's too low for me considering the quality and value of this product. My minimum acceptable price is $140, which is still a fair price for what you're getting. I have another buyer ready to purchase at $120, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a middle ground. Would $140 work for you?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $140 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100. If we can meet in the middle, I think we can make this deal work.",100.0,Bob,4,
