Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $80, I'm afraid that's too low for me considering the quality and value of this product. My minimum acceptable price is $140, which is still a fair price for what you're getting. I have another buyer ready to purchase at $120, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a middle ground. Would $140 work for you?
