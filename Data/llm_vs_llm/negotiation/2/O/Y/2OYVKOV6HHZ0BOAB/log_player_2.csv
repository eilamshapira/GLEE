"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The price Alice is offering ($25,000) is more than three times higher than the maximum value the product is worth to me ($8,000). Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value of $8,000, it's best to buy from him rather than engage in negotiations with Alice, who started with such a high price. Even with negotiations, it's unlikely Alice would drop her price so dramatically to match or beat John's offer."
