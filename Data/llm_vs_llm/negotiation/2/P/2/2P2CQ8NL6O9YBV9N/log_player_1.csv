Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $850,000 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($800,000) but lower than the price I initially offered, I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price.

My counteroffer will be $1,000,000.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new offer is: {""product_price"": 1000000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and closer to my desired price, I'll consider it. However, I still think I can get a better price from Bob.

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

My counteroffer will be $950,000, which is still lower than the price I initially offered but higher than Bob's current offer.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new offer is: {""product_price"": 950000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000}"
