"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer is the same as John's price ($1,200,000), and this is my maximum acceptable price, I should reject and make a counteroffer. There's potential to negotiate a better deal with Alice, especially since the product is worth $800,000 to her, giving room for negotiation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice and $1,200,000 is my maximum price, I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation. I'll offer slightly above Alice's value to make it appealing but still maintain room for back-and-forth negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has significantly reduced her price from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000, which is a substantial improvement. However, since there's still room for negotiation (as the product is worth $800,000 to her), and I'm not under immediate pressure, I'll reject and make another counteroffer. The negotiation is moving in a favorable direction.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice came down significantly from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000, showing willingness to negotiate. I'll increase my previous offer but still try to get a better deal than her $1,000,000 offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has made another concession, reducing the price to $950,000. This is a very good offer, saving me $250,000 compared to John's price. While there might be a small room for further negotiation, the risk of losing this good deal might not be worth it. The price is now reasonably close to Alice's value ($800,000), and we've had a productive negotiation bringing the price down from $1,200,000. I'll accept this offer.
