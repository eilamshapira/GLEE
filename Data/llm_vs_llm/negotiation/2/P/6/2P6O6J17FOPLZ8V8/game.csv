"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. I'm interested in the product, but the price of $2500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000, considering the product's value to me. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this proposal.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your counteroffer, but I must point out that $600000 is significantly below the product's market value. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1500000, which reflects the minimum value of this product to me. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation as I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. I can offer you the product for $2100000, which is already a $400000 reduction from my initial offer. This premium product delivers exceptional value that justifies this investment. What are your thoughts?",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for continuing our negotiation. I understand that $600000 was a low offer, and I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price. However, $2100000 is still above my budget. Considering the product's value to me and the fact that I have an alternative option to buy it from John for $800000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. This price reflects my maximum willingness to pay, and I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for sharing more details about your situation. I understand you have a budget constraint and an alternative option available at $800000. However, I need to emphasize that I have a firm commitment from John to purchase this product for $1500000, which represents the minimum value I can accept based on my costs and the product's market worth. Given this reality, I simply cannot go below $1500000 without taking a loss. I'm willing to offer you the product at $1600000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offers and only slightly above my minimum acceptable price. This represents good value considering the premium quality of the product. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price point.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
