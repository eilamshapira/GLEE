Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. I'm interested in the product, but the price of $2500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000, considering the product's value to me. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this proposal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your counteroffer, but I must point out that $600,000 is significantly below the product's market value. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,500,000, which reflects the minimum value of this product to me. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation as I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. I can offer you the product for $2,100,000, which is already a $400,000 reduction from my initial offer. This premium product delivers exceptional value that justifies this investment.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for continuing our negotiation. I understand that $600000 was a low offer, and I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price. However, $2100000 is still above my budget. Considering the product's value to me and the fact that I have an alternative option to buy it from John for $800000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. This price reflects my maximum willingness to pay, and I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for sharing more details about your situation. I understand you have a budget constraint and an alternative option available at $800,000. However, I need to emphasize that I have a firm commitment from John to purchase this product for $1,500,000, which represents the minimum value I can accept based on my costs and the product's market worth. Given this reality, I simply cannot go below $1,500,000 without taking a loss. I'm willing to offer you the product at $1,600,000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offers and only slightly above my minimum acceptable price.
