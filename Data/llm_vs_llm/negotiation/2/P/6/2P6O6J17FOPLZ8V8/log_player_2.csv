Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your counteroffer, but I must point out that $600000 is significantly below the product's market value. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1500000, which reflects the minimum value of this product to me. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation as I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. I can offer you the product for $2100000, which is already a $400000 reduction from my initial offer. This premium product delivers exceptional value that justifies this investment. What are your thoughts?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for sharing more details about your situation. I understand you have a budget constraint and an alternative option available at $800000. However, I need to emphasize that I have a firm commitment from John to purchase this product for $1500000, which represents the minimum value I can accept based on my costs and the product's market worth. Given this reality, I simply cannot go below $1500000 without taking a loss. I'm willing to offer you the product at $1600000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offers and only slightly above my minimum acceptable price. This represents good value considering the premium quality of the product. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price point.
