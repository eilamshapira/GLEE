"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice is offering the product for $10,000, but it's worth no more than $8,000 to me. John is willing to sell it for exactly $8,000, which is my maximum value for this product.

Since Alice's initial offer exceeds my maximum value, and is $2,000 higher than John's price, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice that gives us room to negotiate.

{""product_price"": $6,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price from $10,000 to $9,500, which shows some willingness to negotiate. However, this price is still above my maximum value of $8,000 and higher than John's offer of $8,000.

Since Alice's offer is still not competitive compared to my alternative option with John, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $7,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price to $9,000, which shows she's continuing to negotiate, but this is still $1,000 more than John's offer of $8,000 and more than my maximum value.

Since Alice's offer is still not competitive with John's price, and we're now in round 5 (halfway through our negotiation rounds), I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer that's closer to what I'm willing to pay.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $7,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has now reduced her price to $8,500, which is getting closer but is still $500 more than John's offer. Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and we're now in round 7 with only a few rounds remaining, I need to make a decision.

John's offer of $8,000 is still the better option financially and matches my maximum value for the product. At this point, it makes sense to buy from John rather than continue negotiating for a potentially less favorable outcome.
