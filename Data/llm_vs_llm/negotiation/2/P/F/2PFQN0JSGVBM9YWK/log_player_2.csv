"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out to offer you our product at a competitive price of $1650000. This product represents significant value in the market, and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $1,650,000
2. The product is worth only $800,000 to me
3. John is offering the same product for $800,000
4. Alice's initial offer is more than double my maximum value

Alice's offer of $1,650,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's alternative offer ($800,000). While I could try to negotiate with Alice, her initial offer is so high that it suggests she might not come down to a price that would work for me. I could reject and make a counteroffer, but since I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at my maximum value point, it makes sense to take that option now.
