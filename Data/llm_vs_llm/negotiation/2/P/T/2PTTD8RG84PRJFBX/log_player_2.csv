"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I should consider the following:

*   **My Valuation:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to me.
*   **Alice's Offer:** $900,000.
*   **Alice's Cost:** The product is worth $800,000 to Alice.
*   **John's Offer:** $1,000,000.

Since I can buy the product from Alice for $900,000 and it is worth $1,000,000 to me, it is better to buy from Alice rather than John.

Therefore, the best decision is to accept Alice's offer.
