"Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $2000000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. What do you say?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $2000000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $400000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my constraints.",400000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $400000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to lower our price to $1800000, considering your budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1700000. This is a significant reduction from our initial offer and reflects our desire to work with you. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price, but $1700000 is still out of my reach. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $500000, which is a significant increase from my initial counteroffer. I hope we can meet somewhere in the middle.",500000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your increased offer, Bob. However, $500000 is still below our minimum threshold. I'm willing to further reduce our price to $1600000, which is our final offer before considering other options. Please let me know if this works for you.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. Given your latest offer, I'm willing to come down to $1600000, which is the lowest we can go while still valuing the product appropriately. This is our final offer before we consider other buyers. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still far beyond my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $600000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. If we can't agree on a price, I'll have to explore other options, including purchasing from John for $800000.",600000.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $600000 is still not feasible for us. Given the value of the product and our previous offers, I'm afraid we cannot go below $1550000. This is our final offer before we consider selling to John. Please let me know if this works for you.",,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, considering your budget constraints and our need to maintain the value of the product, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1550000. This is our final offer before we consider selling to John. Please let me know if this works for you.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
