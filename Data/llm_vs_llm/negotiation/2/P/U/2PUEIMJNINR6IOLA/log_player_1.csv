"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its worth to me."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I understand the value you see in the product, I'm hoping we can settle on a more mutually beneficial price. Would you consider selling it for $1200000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $1,200,000 because it's still lower than the maximum value I can get from him, which is $1,500,000. I'll proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a serious offer, I still believe the product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
