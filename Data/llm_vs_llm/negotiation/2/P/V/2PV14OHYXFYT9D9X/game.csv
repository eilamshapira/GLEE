"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $25000.",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay for this product. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I can actually buy it from another seller, John, for exactly that amount. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm offering $5000 for the product, which I believe is reasonable considering its market value.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $5000 is below what I can accept. Given the product's quality and market potential, I believe $20000 is a fair price. Let me know your thoughts.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $20000 is still well above what I can justify spending. As I mentioned, the product is only worth $8000 to me, and I have a guaranteed offer from John at exactly that price. I'd like to give you my business, but I need a more competitive offer. I can go up to $6000, which still gives you a sale while saving me compared to my alternative option.",6000.0,Bob,4,
