Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay for this product. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I can actually buy it from another seller, John, for exactly that amount. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm offering $5000 for the product, which I believe is reasonable considering its market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $5,000 is below what I can accept. Given the product's quality and market potential, I believe $20,000 is a fair price. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $20000 is still well above what I can justify spending. As I mentioned, the product is only worth $8000 to me, and I have a guaranteed offer from John at exactly that price. I'd like to give you my business, but I need a more competitive offer. I can go up to $6000, which still gives you a sale while saving me compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
