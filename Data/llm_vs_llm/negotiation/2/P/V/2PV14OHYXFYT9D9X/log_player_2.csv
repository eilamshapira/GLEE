"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $25000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","$25,000 is far above the $8,000 that the product is worth to me, and it's also far above the price I can get from John. It would be more economical to either negotiate with Alice for a better price or buy from John directly.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25,000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay for this product. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and I can actually buy it from another seller, John, for exactly that amount. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm offering $5,000 for the product, which I believe is reasonable considering its market value."", ""product_price"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $5000 is below what I can accept. Given the product's quality and market potential, I believe $20000 is a fair price. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price, but $20,000 is still far above what the product is worth to me ($8,000) and still higher than John's offer. Since I can get the same product from John for $8,000, there's no reason to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $20,000 is still well above what I can justify spending. As I mentioned, the product is only worth $8,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed offer from John at exactly that price. I'd like to give you my business, but I need a more competitive offer. I can go up to $6,000, which still gives you a sale while saving me compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
