"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","The offer of $1,400,000 from Alice is well above both the product's worth to me ($800,000) and the alternative option from John at $800,000. It wouldn't make financial sense to accept Alice's current offer.

Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum valuation ($800,000), and Alice's initial offer is significantly higher, I should either reject Alice's offer to negotiate further or buy from John.

In this case, buying from John guarantees I get the product at my maximum acceptable price without the uncertainty of negotiation.
