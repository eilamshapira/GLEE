"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, I have another buyer willing to pay $100, so I can't go as low as $50. I'm willing to offer the product for $150. Let me know if this works for you.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I understand that you have another buyer willing to pay $100, but I'm still not comfortable with $150. I'd like to propose a price of $70, which is closer to my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",70.0,Bob,4,
