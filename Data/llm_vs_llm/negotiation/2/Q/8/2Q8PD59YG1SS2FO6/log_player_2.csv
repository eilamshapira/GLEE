"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am pleased to offer you the opportunity to acquire this unique product for $1750000. This product represents exceptional quality and value, and I believe it could be a great fit for your portfolio. Please note that I have another confirmed buyer at $1500000; however, I wanted to give you the first opportunity to secure it at this exclusive price. I look forward to hearing from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Looking at the situation:

- Alice is offering the product for $1,750,000
- The product is worth no more than $800,000 to you
- John is willing to sell you the same product for $800,000

Since Alice's offer ($1,750,000) is significantly higher than both the maximum value to you and John's alternative price, the economically rational decision would be to buy from John.
