"Given my budget constraints, I'd like to offer $500000 for the product. I believe this price point reflects its value more accurately. I'm open to discussing this further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I must say that $500000 is a bit lower than I had in mind. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $1800000, which is still a discount from my initial price. I'm open to further negotiations if this price doesn't meet your expectations.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that we're both trying to find a fair price for the product. Based on my budget and the product's value to me, I'm ready to offer $800000. I hope this price is closer to what you have in mind, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate the increase to $800000, but I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. Considering we're getting closer, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $1600000. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
