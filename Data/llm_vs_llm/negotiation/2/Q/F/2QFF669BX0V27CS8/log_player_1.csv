Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. 

Since I know:
1. The product is worth $120 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $120
3. Bob can only accept or reject, not negotiate

I can safely offer the product at $120 to Bob. If he accepts, I get $120. If he rejects, I still get $120 from John. There's no incentive to go lower, and going higher would likely lead to rejection.
