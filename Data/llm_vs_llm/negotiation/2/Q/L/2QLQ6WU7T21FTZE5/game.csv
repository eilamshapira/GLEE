"Bob, I'm thrilled you're interested in acquiring this unique asset. It's truly one-of-a-kind, and I believe it could be incredibly valuable to you. To start the conversation, I'm offering it to you for $2500000.",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2.5 million is significantly above my budget and the market value I've researched. While I'm interested in the product, I need to be practical about the investment. I can offer $1200000, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is too low. While I value your interest, I must also consider its intrinsic worth. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $2200000.",2200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. However, $2.2 million is still well above what I can justify for this purchase. I know the product has value, but I have an alternative offer from another seller at $1.5 million. To make this work with you, I could go up to $1350000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This would be a win-win situation, allowing you to make the sale quickly while giving me some room in my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
