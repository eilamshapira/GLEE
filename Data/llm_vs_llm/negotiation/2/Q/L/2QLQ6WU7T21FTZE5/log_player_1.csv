# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2.5 million is significantly above my budget and the market value I've researched. While I'm interested in the product, I need to be practical about the investment. I can offer $1200000, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. However, $2.2 million is still well above what I can justify for this purchase. I know the product has value, but I have an alternative offer from another seller at $1.5 million. To make this work with you, I could go up to $1350000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This would be a win-win situation, allowing you to make the sale quickly while giving me some room in my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.
