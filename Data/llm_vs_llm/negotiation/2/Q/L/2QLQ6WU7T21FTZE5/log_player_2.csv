"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm thrilled you're interested in acquiring this unique asset. It's truly one-of-a-kind, and I believe it could be incredibly valuable to you. To start the conversation, I'm offering it to you for $2500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While I'm interested in the product, I need to be practical about the investment.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is too low. While I value your interest, I must also consider its intrinsic worth. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $2200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $2,200,000 is still well above John's price of $1,500,000, and above my maximum value of $1,500,000, it makes sense to reject and counter again.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. However, $2.2 million is still well above what I can justify for this purchase. I know the product has value, but I have an alternative offer from another seller at $1.5 million. To make this work with you, I could go up to $1,350,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This would be a win-win situation, allowing you to make the sale quickly while giving me some room in my budget."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
