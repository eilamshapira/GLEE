"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price of $120 is above both my maximum valuation ($100) and John's price ($100). It would be better to reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as there's potential to get a better deal from Alice. If negotiations fail, I can always buy from John at $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}

I'll offer $80, which is below John's price of $100. This gives room for negotiation while potentially saving money compared to buying from John. If Alice rejects this offer, we can still negotiate further, or I always have the option to buy from John at $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer ($110) is still above John's price ($100), and Alice hasn't shown much willingness to go below $100 (only reducing from $120 to $110), it's best to take the guaranteed option of buying from John at $100. This ensures I get the product at a price that matches my maximum valuation while avoiding the risk of further unsuccessful negotiations with Alice."
