"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is close to but still below my maximum budget of $1,500,000, and I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer. This gives me a chance to potentially negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable, considering I know the product's worth to Alice is $1,200,000. My goal is to save as much money as possible while still being realistic about the negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,425,000 is a reduction from her previous offer, indicating she's willing to negotiate. However, it's still above my initial counteroffer of $1,000,000 and closer to my maximum budget of $1,500,000. Since I'm aiming to save as much money as possible and Alice has shown willingness to lower the price, I'll reject this offer as well and make another counteroffer, trying to meet somewhere in the middle or closer to Alice's reservation price of $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Next, I'll send a new counteroffer to Alice. Considering her last offer was $1,425,000, I'll aim for a price that's higher than my initial offer but still lower than hers, to encourage further negotiation.
