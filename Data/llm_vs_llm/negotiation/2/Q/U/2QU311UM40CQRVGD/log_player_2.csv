"Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The rational choice here is to buy from John for $1,200,000 because:
1. Alice's offer ($5,000,000) is significantly higher than John's price ($1,200,000)
2. Alice's offer is more than my maximum value for the product ($1,200,000)
3. John's price exactly matches my maximum value for the product
4. Buying from John will save me $3,800,000 compared to Alice's offer"
