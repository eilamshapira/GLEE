"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,500,000, and it's also higher than John's guaranteed price. There's no reason to accept this offer. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, starting with a lower price to leave room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price, which gives room for negotiation. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground that's below my maximum value of $1,500,000. If the negotiation doesn't progress favorably, I still have the option to buy from John at $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has lowered her price from $2,000,000 to $1,750,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this price is still higher than John's offer of $1,500,000, which is also my maximum value. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a price point below $1,500,000. If we can't reach an agreement below that price, I can still exercise the option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'll increase my previous offer to $1,250,000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer of $1,000,000, showing I'm willing to negotiate in good faith. This price is also strategically chosen as it's:
1. Below my maximum value of $1,500,000
2. Below John's price of $1,500,000
3. Shows substantial movement from my previous offer
4. Still leaves room for further negotiation if needed

If Alice rejects this offer, I still have several rounds to negotiate or can fall back on John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $1,500,000. Here's why:

1. Alice's latest offer ($1,600,000) is still above both:
   - My maximum value ($1,500,000)
   - John's guaranteed price ($1,500,000)

2. While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate down (from $2M → $1.75M → $1.6M), the decrements are getting smaller, suggesting we may not reach a price below $1.5M.

3. There's no reason to pay more than $1,500,000 when:
   - That's my maximum value
   - I have a guaranteed option at that price from John

It's time to exercise the John option and secure the product at the maximum price I'm willing to pay."
