Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get more than my minimum acceptable price of $80.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $90 is better than my guaranteed alternative of selling to John for $80, and there's a risk that pushing too hard might lead Bob to walk away, I'll accept this offer.
