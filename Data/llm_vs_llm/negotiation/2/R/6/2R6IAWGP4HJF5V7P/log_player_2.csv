"Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given the information:
- I am looking for a product worth no more than $8,000 to me
- Alice is offering the product for $25,000
- John is willing to sell the same product for $8,000

Alice's offer ($25,000) is significantly higher than what the product is worth to me and also higher than John's price. The most economical choice is to buy from John.
