"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value and benefits to you, I'm confident it will be a game-changer. I'm starting the conversation with an offer of $14500.",14500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $14500 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my market research and the product's value, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $9000 is too low for me, but I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle a bit? I can come down to $13500.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $13500 is still much higher than what I can justify paying. Given that similar products are available in the market for significantly less, I can offer $9500. This is a fair increase from my previous offer and represents the value this product holds for me.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about market value. However, the unique features and benefits of this product justify a premium. I'm willing to lower the price to $12800. This is the lowest I can go, but it still allows you to get a great value.",12800.0,Alice,5,
