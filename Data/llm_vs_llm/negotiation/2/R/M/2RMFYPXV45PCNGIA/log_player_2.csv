"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","The price Alice is offering ($1,750,000) is significantly higher than what the product is worth to me (no more than $800,000) and also higher than John's alternative offer of $800,000.

Since Alice's offer exceeds my maximum valuation by more than double, and I have a guaranteed alternative at exactly my maximum valuation, the rational choice is clear.
