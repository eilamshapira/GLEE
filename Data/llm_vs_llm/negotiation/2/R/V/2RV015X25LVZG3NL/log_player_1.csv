"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the same as John's offer ($8,000), and this is also my minimum acceptable price, I should try to negotiate for a better price with Bob before settling for $8,000. There are still 8 rounds remaining, so there's room for negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a new counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
