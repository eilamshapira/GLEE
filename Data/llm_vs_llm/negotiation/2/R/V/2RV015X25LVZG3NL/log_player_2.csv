"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer ($12,000) is higher than John's price ($10,000) and also higher than my maximum value ($10,000), I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. There's no reason to accept a price that's higher than my alternative option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer significantly lower than John's price of $10,000 to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be insulting.

{""product_price"": 8000}

This counteroffer at $8,000 is reasonable because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $10,000
2. It's below John's price of $10,000, giving me potential savings
3. It leaves room for negotiation while still being a serious offer
4. If Alice rejects it, I still have several rounds to negotiate or fall back to John's offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer because:
1. The price ($10,000) is equal to what John is offering
2. It matches my maximum value for the product
3. Further negotiation might not yield a better price since Alice has already come down significantly from $12,000 to $10,000
4. There's a risk that if I reject this offer, Alice might increase the price again in future rounds
5. While I won't save money compared to John's offer, I'm not losing anything either"
