"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

```json
{""product_price"": 250}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **High Initial Price:** I'm starting high. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I want to see how much he's willing to pay. $250 seems like a reasonable starting point that still leaves room for negotiation.
*   **John as a Fallback:** Knowing I can always get $100 from John provides a solid floor. I won't accept anything less than that ultimately.
*   **Negotiation Room:** Offering $250 leaves me plenty of space to come down in subsequent rounds if needed."
