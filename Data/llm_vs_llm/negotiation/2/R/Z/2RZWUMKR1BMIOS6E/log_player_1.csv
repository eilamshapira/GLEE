"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","I'll consider my options. Bob's offer of $90 is more than my reservation price of $80, but I believe I can get a better price since the product is worth $120 to Bob.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 100}"
