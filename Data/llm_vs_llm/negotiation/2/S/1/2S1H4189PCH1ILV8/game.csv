"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little steep for me.  I'm interested, but I was hoping to spend closer to $50. Would you be willing to go that low?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your interest. While $50 is too low, I could meet you halfway. How about $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $125 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and your current one, would $87.50 work for you?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you drive a hard bargain!  I can go a bit lower, but $87.50 is too low for me.  How about we settle at $110? That's my final offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
