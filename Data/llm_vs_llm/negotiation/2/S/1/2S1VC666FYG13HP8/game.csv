"Alice, thank you for your offer, but I feel the price is a bit high. Given my budget and the value it brings to me, I'd like to offer $600000 for the product. This price point aligns better with my current financial planning. How does that sound to you?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's significantly below my bottom line for this product. I understand you're working within a budget, but the value this product provides is substantial. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to its actual worth. How about $900000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900000 is still higher than what I'm prepared to invest. In an effort to find a middle ground, I'm willing to raise my offer to $700000. This price recognizes the product's value while respecting my budget constraints. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer. We're getting closer. However, $700000 is still below what I can accept. Given that this product is worth $800000 to you, how about we meet in the middle at $850000?",850000.0,Alice,5,
