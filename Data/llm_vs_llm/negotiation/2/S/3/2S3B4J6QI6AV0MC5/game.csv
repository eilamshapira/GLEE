"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product available for you today. This is a premium item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $220. Let me know if you're interested.",220.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $220 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $80 at this time. Let me know if that's something you're willing to work with.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I can't go as low as $80. This product's quality and value justifies a higher price. I have another buyer willing to pay $120, but I'd prefer to work with you. I can come down to $180. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but I'm still only able to offer $100.  It's a fair price considering I'm willing to buy it right now.  If you're not willing to come down, I'm going to have to consider my other options.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $100, but I need to be transparent with you. I have another buyer, John, who's committed to purchasing at $120. I value building a relationship with you, so I can offer $150, which is still a significant reduction from my initial price. This product is worth considerably more, and I hope we can find middle ground that works for both of us.",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $100.  This is a fair price given my budget and the fact that you're already dealing with another buyer.  Let me know if you're willing to reconsider.",100.0,Bob,6,
