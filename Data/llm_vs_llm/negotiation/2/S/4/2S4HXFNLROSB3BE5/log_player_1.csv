Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic offer to Bob that maximizes my potential profit while encouraging him to accept or at least continue negotiating.

Since the product is worth $15,000 to me (my reservation price), and I have John's guaranteed offer at that amount, I don't need to go below $15,000. Bob values the product at $8,000, which is below my reservation price, making it challenging to find common ground.

I'll start with an offer that demonstrates the product's value but leaves some room for potential negotiation if needed.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,500 is well below my reservation price of $15,000, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, it doesn't make economic sense to accept Bob's offer.

Bob's maximum value for the product is $8,000, so his offer of $8,500 is already above his own valuation, which suggests he doesn't have much more room to increase his offer significantly.

The most rational decision is to sell to John at the guaranteed price of $15,000, which meets my minimum acceptable value and provides me with a definite sale.
