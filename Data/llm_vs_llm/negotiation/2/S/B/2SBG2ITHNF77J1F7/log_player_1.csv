Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000}

Rationale: Since I know that:
1. The product is worth $800,000 to Bob
2. I can definitely sell it to John for $1,200,000
3. The product is worth no less than $1,200,000 to me

It makes the most sense to offer Bob the same price I can get from John ($1,200,000). Even though this price is above Bob's valuation of $800,000 and he will likely reject it, I'm not losing anything because I can still sell to John for the same amount. There's no incentive for me to offer a lower price since I'm guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
