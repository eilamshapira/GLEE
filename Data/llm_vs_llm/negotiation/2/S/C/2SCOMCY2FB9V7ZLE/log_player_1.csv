Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic decision about what price to offer Bob. 

The product is worth $80 to Bob, meaning he won't pay more than that amount.
The product is worth at least $120 to me, which is what I could get by selling it to John.
Since Bob values the product at less than what I can get from John, it doesn't make sense for me to sell to Bob.

Any price I offer Bob that would be acceptable to him (â‰¤$80) would result in less money than selling to John for $120.
