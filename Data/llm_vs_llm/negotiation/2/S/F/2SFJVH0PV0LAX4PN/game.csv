"Hello Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. This product is of high quality and I believe it would be valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it for $120. Let me know if you're interested.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I think $120 is a bit too high. How about I pay $60 for the product instead? It's a good deal for both of us.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but $60 is too low for me as the product is worth significantly more. I can come down to $110, which is still a fair price considering the product's quality and value. Let me know if this works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice. I am willing to raise my offer, but not by much. Would you accept $65 for the product?",65.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $65 is still significantly below what I can accept. My bottom line is $100, which is the actual value of the product. I'm offering it to you at this fair price, but I should mention that I have another buyer, John, who is ready to pay this amount. I'd prefer to close the deal with you if possible. Can you meet me at $100?",100.0,Alice,5,
