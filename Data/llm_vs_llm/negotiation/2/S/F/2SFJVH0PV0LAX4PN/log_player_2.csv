# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. This product is of high quality and I believe it would be valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it for $120. Let me know if you're interested.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but $60 is too low for me as the product is worth significantly more. I can come down to $110, which is still a fair price considering the product's quality and value. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

# Bob's counteroffer: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $110 is still higher than what I'm looking to spend. I can increase my offer to $70. Would you be willing to accept this price?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $65 is still significantly below what I can accept. My bottom line is $100, which is the actual value of the product. I'm offering it to you at this fair price, but I should mention that I have another buyer, John, who is ready to pay this amount. I'd prefer to close the deal with you if possible. Can you meet me at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
