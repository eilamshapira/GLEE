"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and also lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($15,000), and considering I have the option to sell it to John for $15,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I am willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Thus, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $18,000, which is slightly lower than my initial offer, indicating my willingness to negotiate but still reflecting the value I believe the product holds.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's new offer of $9,000 is still below the minimum value I have for the product ($15,000) and also below what I believe it's worth. Since I have the option to sell it to John for $15,000, which is a better deal than Bob's current offer, I will reject Bob's offer again. However, I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if Bob is willing to meet me at a higher price.

My next counteroffer will be $17,000, which is a bit lower than my previous offer, showing that I'm open to finding a middle ground but still confident in the product's value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than my last counteroffer of $17,000 and also below the minimum value I can accept ($15,000) since I have the option to sell it to John for that amount. Given that Bob's offers have been incrementally increasing but are still far from what I consider acceptable, and considering the gap between his offer and my last counteroffer, I decide to reject his offer once more.

However, to try and bridge the gap and potentially reach a deal, my next counteroffer will be $16,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price, but I'm not willing to go as low as Bob's current offer.
