Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. Given its exceptional quality and value, I'm offering it to you for $25,000."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $25000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $7,000, I need to consider my options. Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit, and I value the product at no less than $15,000. Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum.

Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $7,000 is too low for me to accept. Considering the product's quality and the investment required, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $22,000?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $22000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $8000. This is a fair price considering my budget constraints. Let me know if you can accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is still far below what I'm willing to accept. Selling to John for $15,000 is the better option at this point, guaranteeing a profit within my acceptable range.
