Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but considering other options available to me, I'd like to make a counteroffer. How about we settle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob knows the product is worth $150 to him, and my minimum acceptable price is $100, there's room for a better deal than $110. I'll make a counteroffer as this price is too close to my minimum acceptable price, and significantly below the product's value to Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $110 is too low considering the product's value. I can offer it to you for $125, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents good value for this product."", ""product_price"": 125}"
