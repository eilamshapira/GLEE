"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its market value and potential benefits, I'm offering it at $950000. This price reflects the product's quality and value proposition.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I believe the product is valuable, but the price of $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000, considering the product's market value and my budget. I'm looking forward to your response.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must point out that $700000 is significantly below the product's market value. I have another buyer willing to pay $800000, but I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Given the product's true value and potential return on investment for you, I'm willing to adjust my price to $875000. This represents a substantial reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's fair market value.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you have another buyer willing to pay $800000, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe that $875000 is higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $825000, which is closer to the price you mentioned the other buyer is willing to pay. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
