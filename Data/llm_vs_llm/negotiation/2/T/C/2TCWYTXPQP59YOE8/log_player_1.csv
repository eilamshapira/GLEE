Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I believe the product is valuable, but the price of $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000, considering the product's market value and my budget. I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $700,000 is below my minimum threshold of $800,000, which is what John is willing to pay. I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, as there's still room for negotiation between his $700,000 and my initial $950,000. If we can't reach an agreement at a price above $800,000, I can always fall back on John's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must point out that $700,000 is significantly below the product's market value. I have another buyer willing to pay $800,000, but I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Given the product's true value and potential return on investment for you, I'm willing to adjust my price to $875,000. This represents a substantial reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's fair market value."", ""product_price"": 875000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you have another buyer willing to pay $800000, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe that $875000 is higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $825000, which is closer to the price you mentioned the other buyer is willing to pay. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer of $825,000. This is a reasonable price that exceeds John's offer of $800,000, and it's within an acceptable range above my minimum threshold. While it's lower than my initial asks, it represents a fair compromise and allows both parties to benefit from the transaction. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing this decent offer, and there's no guarantee we'd reach a significantly better price."
