Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must point out that $700000 is significantly below the product's market value. I have another buyer willing to pay $800000, but I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Given the product's true value and potential return on investment for you, I'm willing to adjust my price to $875000. This represents a substantial reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's fair market value.

I understand that you have another buyer willing to pay $800,000, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe that $875,000 is higher than I'm comfortable paying.
