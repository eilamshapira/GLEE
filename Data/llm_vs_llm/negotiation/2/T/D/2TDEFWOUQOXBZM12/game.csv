"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $11500 is a bit high for me. Given market conditions, I think $10500 would be a more reasonable price. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more affordable for me. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $11000.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $11000?  That's still a good deal for both of us, and it shows I'm serious about making this sale.",11000.0,Alice,3,
