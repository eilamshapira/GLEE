"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $11500 is a bit high for me. Given market conditions, I think $10500 would be a more reasonable price. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more affordable for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,000.  Let's try to find a middle ground.""} 
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $11,000?  That's still a good deal for both of us, and it shows I'm serious about making this sale."", ""product_price"": 11000}
