"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11500. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me think about this strategically:

1. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
2. Alice's offer is $11,500, which is below my maximum
3. The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation
4. John's offer of $12,000 is my fallback option, but it's the highest price

Since this is just the first round and Alice's initial offer is likely high, I should try to negotiate for a better price. $11,500 is too close to my maximum value, and knowing Alice's cost is $10,000, there's potential to get a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but leaves room for negotiation:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $11,500 is a bit high for me. Given market conditions, I think $10,500 would be a more reasonable price. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more affordable for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $11000?  That's still a good deal for both of us, and it shows I'm serious about making this sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this new offer:

1. Alice has dropped the price from $11,500 to $11,000 ($500 reduction)
2. This shows she's willing to negotiate and is meeting me partway
3. $11,000 is $1,000 less than John's price
4. We still have several rounds left for negotiation
5. However, $11,000 is already a reasonable price, saving me $1,000 compared to John's offer

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has made a significant concession, and $11,000 represents a good deal that's well below my maximum value of $12,000. The risk of pushing too hard might lead to a less favorable outcome, and the current savings of $1,000 compared to John's price is substantial.
