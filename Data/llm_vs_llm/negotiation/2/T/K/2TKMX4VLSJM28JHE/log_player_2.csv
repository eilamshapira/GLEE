"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $1,400,000, I need to evaluate my options carefully.

This offer is already $100,000 less than John's fixed price of $1,500,000, which is good. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, there's likely room for further negotiation to get a better price.

Given that we have 10 rounds of negotiation available, and this is only the first round, I should reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This gives me an opportunity to potentially save more money while still having the option to accept Alice's offer or buy from John later if negotiations don't progress favorably.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $1,100,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has come down to $1,300,000 from her initial $1,400,000 offer, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is already $200,000 better than John's price, but I believe there's still room to negotiate since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice.

We're only in round 3 of 10 possible rounds, so I still have time to continue negotiating for a better price. Alice dropping her price by $100,000 after my counteroffer is a positive sign.

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I see Alice has reduced her offer again to $1,250,000, which is $50,000 less than her previous offer. This pattern suggests she's willing to continue negotiating, but in smaller increments now.

At $1,250,000, this is already $250,000 better than John's price of $1,500,000. We're now in round 5 of 10, so we still have room to negotiate, though I should be more strategic now.

Since Alice has only moved $50,000 this time (compared to $100,000 previously), I'll continue negotiating but should be prepared to accept soon if the decrements continue to shrink.
