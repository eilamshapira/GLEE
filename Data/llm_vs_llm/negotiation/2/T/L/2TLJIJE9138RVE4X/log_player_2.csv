"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an exclusive offer for you. This premium product is available for just $1500000, a great opportunity for you to secure a highly valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she's selling the product for $1,500,000. This is exactly the same price that John is offering ($1,500,000) and it's also exactly the maximum amount the product is worth to you.

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price, and this price equals the maximum value of the product to you, there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other. In this case, I'll accept Alice's offer since she approached you first.
