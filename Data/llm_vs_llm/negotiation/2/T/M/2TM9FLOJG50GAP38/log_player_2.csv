"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since the product is worth $8,000 to me and Alice's offer is $9,000, which is higher than my desired price, I will reject Alice's offer. I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a price that is closer to my desired price of $8,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $8,500 is closer to my desired price of $8,000, but still slightly higher. However, considering that I can buy the product from John for $8,000, I have a good alternative option.

In this case, I will reject Alice's offer again, as I believe I can get a better deal. Since Alice has already lowered her price from $9,000 to $8,500, I'm hoping she may be willing to lower it further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's latest offer was $8,500, and I know I can buy the product from John for $8,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's even closer to my desired price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $8,400 is getting closer to my desired price, but I still have the option to buy from John for $8,000, which is an even better deal.

At this point, I think it's unlikely that Alice will go lower than $8,400, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy the product from John for $8,000.
