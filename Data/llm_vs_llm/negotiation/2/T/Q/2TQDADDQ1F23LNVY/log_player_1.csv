Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully think about the best price to offer Bob.

From my perspective:
- I value the product at $150 minimum
- If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell to John for $150
- Bob values the product at $150

Since Bob values the product at exactly $150, he would only accept offers at or below $150. If I offer exactly $150, he should be indifferent between accepting and rejecting (though in reality, he might reject since there's no gain for him).

Given that I have a guaranteed backup buyer at $150, there's no reason for me to offer less than $150 to Bob. If I offered $150, either:
1. Bob accepts and I get $150
2. Bob rejects and I sell to John for $150

Either way, I get $150, which is my minimum acceptable amount.
