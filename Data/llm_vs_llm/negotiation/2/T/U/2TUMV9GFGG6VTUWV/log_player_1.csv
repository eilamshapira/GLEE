"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to anchor the negotiation and leave room for potential counteroffers while ensuring I don't go below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.

{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $10,000, there's no reason to accept Bob's offer. While I could continue negotiating with Bob, I don't want to risk losing time if Bob continues to make low offers.
