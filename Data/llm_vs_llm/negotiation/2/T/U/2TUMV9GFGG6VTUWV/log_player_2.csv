"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to analyze this offer carefully. Alice is offering to sell the product for $18,000, but the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me. Additionally, I know I can buy the same product from John for $12,000 at any time.

Since Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation and John's alternative price, it makes no sense to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I can buy the product from John for $12,000, and that's also my maximum valuation, I should offer Alice significantly less to make the deal worthwhile for me. I'll start with a low counteroffer to leave room for negotiation.
