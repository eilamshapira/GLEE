"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. However, I believe $18000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $8000 is too low for this product's value. I can offer it to you for $15000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and features. Would this work better for you?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the reduction, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to offer $11500 for the product. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",11500.0,Bob,4,
