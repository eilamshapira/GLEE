Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it for $18,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. However, I believe $18000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer because $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Since Bob showed interest but indicated budget concerns, I'll try a lower price than my initial offer but still above my minimum.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $8,000 is too low for this product's value. I can offer it to you for $15,000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the reduction, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to offer $11500 for the product. Is this something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $11,500 is below John's guaranteed offer of $12,000, and Bob's offers have been consistently below my minimum acceptable price, it makes more financial sense to sell to John. The negotiation with Bob doesn't seem likely to exceed $12,000 based on his negotiation pattern, so I'll take the sure deal with John."
