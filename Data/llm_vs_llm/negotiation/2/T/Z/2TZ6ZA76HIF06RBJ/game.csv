"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on its market value and unique features, I'm offering it for $1800000. This product provides excellent value and has been appraised favorably. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1800000 is beyond my budget for this product. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $900000. It's my best offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but $900000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. The product has been independently valued, and I already have another buyer willing to pay $1200000. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. My counteroffer is $1400000, which represents a $400000 reduction from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1400000 is still more than I'm willing to spend. I'm aware of other options available to me. My maximum budget for this product is $1100000. I hope we can find a common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
