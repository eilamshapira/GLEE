Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but $900,000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. The product has been independently valued, and I already have another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. My counteroffer is $1,400,000, which represents a $400,000 reduction from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
