"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but $900000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. The product has been independently valued, and I already have another buyer willing to pay $1200000. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. My counteroffer is $1400000, which represents a $400000 reduction from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
