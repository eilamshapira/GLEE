Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $18,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you Alice for the offer, but I was hoping to spend less. How about we settle for $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer is equal to the minimum amount I'm willing to accept, but I believe the product is worth more, I'll try to negotiate further to see if Bob is willing to pay a higher price. My next offer will be lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer.

{""message"": ""Thank you Bob for your offer, but I was hoping to get a bit more for the product. How about we meet in the middle between my initial offer and your counteroffer? I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000."", ""product_price"": 15000}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $15000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's split the difference again? I'm thinking $13500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

Since Bob is willing to increase his offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to meet him halfway again, but this time, I'll aim for a slightly higher price to see if he's willing to compromise further.

{""message"": ""Thank you Bob for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. Let's try to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
