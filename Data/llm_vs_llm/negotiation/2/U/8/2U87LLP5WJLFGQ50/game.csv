"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the special price, I've done some market research and believe the fair value for this product is considerably lower. The product is worth around $1200000 to most sellers in the market. I'm prepared to offer you $1250000, which gives you a reasonable profit while still being fair to me. This is a competitive offer compared to other options I'm considering.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product to us is higher than your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1350000. This price reflects a significant discount from our initial offer while still recognizing the product's true value. Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. While $1350000 is better, I've been offered similar products elsewhere at lower prices. I can raise my offer to $1290000, which gives you a solid $90000 profit over your cost. This is the best I can do while still staying within my budget constraints. I'm ready to close this deal today if we can agree on this price.",1290000.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $1290000 is still below what we believe is fair for this product. I'm prepared to lower our price further to $1320000, which I believe is a strong compromise. This offer reflects our desire to work with you while ensuring we receive a fair value for our product. Please let me know if this works for you.",1320000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
