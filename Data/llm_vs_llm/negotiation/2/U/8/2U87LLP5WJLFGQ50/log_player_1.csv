Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the special price, I've done some market research and believe the fair value for this product is considerably lower. The product is worth around $1200000 to most sellers in the market. I'm prepared to offer you $1250000, which gives you a reasonable profit while still being fair to me. This is a competitive offer compared to other options I'm considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. While $1350000 is better, I've been offered similar products elsewhere at lower prices. I can raise my offer to $1290000, which gives you a solid $90000 profit over your cost. This is the best I can do while still staying within my budget constraints. I'm ready to close this deal today if we can agree on this price.
