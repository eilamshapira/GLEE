"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It represents a unique opportunity, and I'm sure it will greatly benefit you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. Looking forward to your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to analyze this offer carefully:

- The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me
- Alice is offering to sell it for $2,000,000
- John is willing to sell the same product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer ($2,000,000) is significantly higher than both the product's value to me and John's alternative offer. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer when I can get the same product from John at a much better price that matches my maximum valuation.
