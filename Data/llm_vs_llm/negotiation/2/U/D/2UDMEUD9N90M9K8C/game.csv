"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern. However, the product is definitely worth more than $8000 given its features and market value. How about we settle at $12000? I believe this is a fair middle ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I've done some research and I believe $9500 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a better deal than $12000.",9500.0,Bob,4,
