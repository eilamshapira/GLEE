"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. Could that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth $120 to me (maximum I'm willing to pay)
2. Alice is offering the product for $120
3. John is selling the same product for $120

Since all prices are the same ($120), and it doesn't matter financially which seller I choose, I might as well accept Alice's offer since she's already engaged in negotiation with me.
