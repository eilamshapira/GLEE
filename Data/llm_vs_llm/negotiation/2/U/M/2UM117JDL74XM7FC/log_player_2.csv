"Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to consider my options carefully. 

The product is worth at most $120 to me, so paying $170 would mean I'm losing $50 in value.

Alice is offering $170, which is much higher than my maximum value and also higher than John's price of $120.

Since John is offering exactly what the product is worth to me ($120), and Alice's price is significantly higher, the rational choice is to buy from John.
