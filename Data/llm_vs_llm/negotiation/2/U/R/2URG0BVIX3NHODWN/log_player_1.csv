"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I know my product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a high initial offer to test Bob's willingness to pay.

{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the same as John's guaranteed offer ($1,000,000), and it's only round 2, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate for a higher price. There's no risk in continuing negotiation at this point since I can always fall back on John's offer later if needed.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer somewhat, but still maintain a high price point since I have the safety net of John's $1,000,000 offer.

{""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob has increased his offer to $1,250,000, which is $250,000 more than John's guaranteed offer. This is a good offer that provides a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Bob might withdraw or lower his offer. I'll accept this offer.
