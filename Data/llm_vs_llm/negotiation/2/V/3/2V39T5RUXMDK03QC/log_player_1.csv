Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think this through:

1. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,200,000 from John
3. Bob will reject any offer above $1,000,000 since that would be a loss for him
4. I'm guaranteed $1,200,000 from John if Bob rejects
5. Therefore, there's no reason for me to offer Bob any price below $1,200,000
