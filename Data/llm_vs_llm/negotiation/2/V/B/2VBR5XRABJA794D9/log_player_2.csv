"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $250 is far too high compared to my maximum value of $80. Since I can always buy from John for $80, there's no reason to accept any price higher than that. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 40}

I'll start with a low counteroffer of $40, which is half of my maximum value and the price I could get from John. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's price. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground that's below $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $200 is still way above my maximum value of $80 and higher than John's price. While she did reduce the price from her initial offer, it's still not close to an acceptable range. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 50}

I'll increase my offer slightly to $50. Since I know I can get the product for $80 from John, I want to keep my offers well below that price to try to get a better deal. However, I'm showing some flexibility by increasing my previous offer. If Alice continues to make high counteroffers, I might eventually decide to just buy from John instead of continuing negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $175 is still more than twice my maximum value and John's price of $80. While she continues to lower her price, the reductions are too small and the price is still far from acceptable. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, but if Alice doesn't start making more significant reductions, I might need to consider buying from John soon to avoid wasting more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 60}

I'll increase my offer to $60. This shows continued willingness to negotiate while still staying well below John's price of $80. I'm hoping Alice will realize that she needs to make a more significant reduction in her price, as I have the alternative option to buy from John. If Alice's next counter remains significantly above $80, I'll seriously consider ending the negotiation and buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price near $80. While she has been reducing her price, the reductions are too small and she's still asking nearly twice what John is offering. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Alice's offers are still far above my maximum value of $80. Rather than continue this negotiation which doesn't seem to be converging to an acceptable price, I'll take the guaranteed option of buying from John for $80."
