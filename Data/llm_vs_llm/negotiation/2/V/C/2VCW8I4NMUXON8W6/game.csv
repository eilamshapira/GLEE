"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $1200000 is below what I can accept, I understand your position. However, this product has significant value, and my initial price might have been too high. I'm willing to come down substantially to $1700000. This represents a $400000 reduction from my initial offer and better reflects the product's true market value.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
