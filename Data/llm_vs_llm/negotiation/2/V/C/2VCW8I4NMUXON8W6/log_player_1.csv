"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,100,000. This is a competitive price for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 2100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer because I believe we can find a middle ground that benefits both parties. While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price (as evidenced by John's offer), I think the product has more value than that, and we should continue negotiating.

Round 3, I'll make a new offer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $1,200,000 is below what I can accept, I understand your position. However, this product has significant value, and my initial price might have been too high. I'm willing to come down substantially to $1,700,000. This represents a $400,000 reduction from my initial offer and better reflects the product's true market value."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the significant reduction in price. I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,400,000. This is a reasonable compromise that gives me $200,000 more than John's standing offer, and we've made good progress in the negotiation from both sides. While I might be able to negotiate for a bit more, there's also a risk of losing this deal if I push too hard, and $1,400,000 represents a satisfactory outcome."
