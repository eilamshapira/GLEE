"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2100000. This is a competitive price for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $2,100,000, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower, but still shows that I'm interested in the product. I'll offer $1,200,000, which is below my maximum budget of $1,500,000.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $1200000 is below what I can accept, I understand your position. However, this product has significant value, and my initial price might have been too high. I'm willing to come down substantially to $1700000. This represents a $400000 reduction from my initial offer and better reflects the product's true market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has already come down by $400,000 from her initial offer, I'll try to meet her halfway between her current offer and my previous counteroffer. Alice's current offer is $1,700,000, and my previous offer was $1,200,000, so the midpoint would be $1,450,000. However, I'll offer slightly less than that to see if I can get an even better deal.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the significant reduction in price. I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
