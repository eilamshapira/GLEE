Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 120}

Rationale: Since I know that:
1. The product is worth $100 to Bob
2. The product is worth at least $120 to me
3. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $120

There's no reason for me to offer Bob a price lower than $120. If Bob accepts, I get $120, and if he rejects (which is likely since it's above his valuation), I still get $120 from John. This way, I ensure I get the maximum possible value regardless of Bob's decision."
