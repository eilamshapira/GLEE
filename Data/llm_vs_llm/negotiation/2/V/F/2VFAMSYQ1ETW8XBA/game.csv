"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $100. Would you be willing to consider it?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for this product. Given its quality and value, I cannot go below $165. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would you consider this price?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $100 was a bit low, but $165 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $122.50? It's a fair price considering the product's value.",122.5,Bob,4,
