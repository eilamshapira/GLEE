"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $100. Would you be willing to consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob since $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I can get a better deal either from Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for this product. Given its quality and value, I cannot go below $165. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would you consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 165}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $100 was a bit low, but $165 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $122.50? It's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's maximum offer ($122.50) is below my minimum acceptable price ($150), and the product is only worth $120 to him, it's unlikely he'll increase his offer above $150. Therefore, the best decision is to sell to John for $150, which guarantees me the minimum price I need."
