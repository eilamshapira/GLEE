"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe could be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1200000. Let me know if you are interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's initial offer is exactly at the maximum value I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000), and I have the option to buy the same product from John for the same price, I see no benefit in accepting Alice's offer without trying to negotiate a better price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in hopes of getting a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable, considering I don't know the product's value to her. Let's start with a counteroffer of $600,000, which is half of the initial offer and also half of the maximum I'm willing to pay. This gives room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility on the price.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest, but I believe the product's value is higher. How about we settle at $1000000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has made a significant reduction in price from her initial offer of $1,200,000 to $1,000,000, showing some flexibility. However, I'm still aiming to save as much money as possible. Since Alice has already come down by $200,000, it indicates she might be willing to negotiate further. My next step will be to try and meet somewhere in the middle between my last offer of $600,000 and Alice's new offer of $1,000,000.

Let's calculate a midpoint: ($600,000 + $1,000,000) / 2 = $800,000.

I'll make a counteroffer of $800,000, which is a compromise and shows I'm willing to move upwards from my initial counteroffer, but still hoping to get a better deal than $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my counteroffer is: $800,000."
