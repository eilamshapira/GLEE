"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $160. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $100 to me (my maximum value)
2. Alice is offering it for $160
3. John is offering it for $100
4. Alice's offer ($160) is:
   - Above my maximum value ($100)
   - Higher than John's offer ($100)

Since Alice's offer is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's alternative offer, the rational decision would be to buy from John.
