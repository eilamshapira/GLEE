"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I must note that your asking price of $2500000 is significantly above my budget and the product's value to me. I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $1000000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product, which gives you a competitive advantage over alternative options I'm considering. I hope we can find a price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counter offer, Bob. I understand you're considering options, but I should clarify that my product differs from what John is offering. Mine has unique qualities and superior value, which is reflected in my pricing. While I appreciate your offer of $800000, that's below my minimum acceptable price. Given that I can sell to another buyer for $1000000, I couldn't accept less than that amount. However, I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price significantly. I can offer you the product for $1800000, which represents a $700000 reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects both the true value of the product and my willingness to work with you.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that your product may have some unique qualities, but I need to be clear about my position. The maximum value of this product to me is $1000000 - which happens to be exactly what John is offering. For me to choose your product over John's, I would need a better price. I'm willing to offer you $950000, which is very close to your minimum acceptable price that you mentioned. This gives you a quick sale while allowing me to capture some value as well. If the unique qualities you mentioned are truly important to me, this gives you an opportunity to elaborate on them while still keeping the deal financially sensible for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your thoughtful counteroffers. I understand you're comparing this to John's offer, but I need to be transparent - I already have John's guaranteed offer of $1000000. For me to sell to you instead, I would need to receive at least that amount. Based on our negotiation so far, I can see you value this product, but perhaps not significantly above the $1000000 mark. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, which is just slightly above my alternative option. This represents a substantial reduction from my previous offers and is much closer to your price point, while still providing me with a small premium over my alternative. Does this work for you?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
