"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $25000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $25,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $8,000

The logical decision would be to buy from John because:
- Alice's price ($25,000) is significantly higher than my maximum value ($8,000)
- John's price ($8,000) matches my maximum value
- I would save $17,000 by buying from John instead of accepting Alice's offer
