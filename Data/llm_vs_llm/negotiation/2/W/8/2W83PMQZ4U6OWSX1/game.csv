"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you first at a price of $1500000.  This is a very competitive price considering its potential.  Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product sounds interesting, $1500000 is more than I'm initially willing to spend. I'd like to start the negotiation at $1000000. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $1300000 is the lowest I can go at this time.  This price still allows for significant profit for you, and I believe the product will more than justify the investment.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly. However, I'm working with a strict budget. I can offer $1100000 at this time. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to lower the price to $1200000, which is my absolute minimum given the product's worth.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1200000 is still a bit too high for me right now. I'm getting closer to my limit. How about we meet in the middle at $1150000?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1150000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $1175000.  This is a fair price that respects both of our positions.",1175000.0,Alice,7,
