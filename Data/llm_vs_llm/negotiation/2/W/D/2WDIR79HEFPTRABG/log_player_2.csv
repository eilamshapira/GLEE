"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $9,900
2. Buy from John: $10,000
3. Reject Alice's offer (which means I'll end up buying from John at $10,000)

Alice's offer saves me $100 compared to John's price. While the savings are minimal, it's still better than paying $10,000 to John. Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, I should accept Alice's offer.
