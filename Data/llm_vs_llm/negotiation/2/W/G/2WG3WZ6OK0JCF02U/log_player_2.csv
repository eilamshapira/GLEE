"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product that I think you'll really love. It's a one-time offer, so please consider it carefully. If you're interested, please let me know and we can finalize the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $100
2. Alice is offering it for $99
3. John's fixed price is $100
4. Alice's cost is $80, so there might be room for negotiation

While Alice's offer of $99 is below my maximum value ($100) and slightly better than John's price ($100), the difference is minimal ($1 savings). Given that Alice's cost is $80, she has significant room for a better price, and rejecting her first offer might lead to a better deal.
