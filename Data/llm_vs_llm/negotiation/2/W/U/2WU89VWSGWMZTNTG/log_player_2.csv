"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to evaluate this offer carefully.

Alice is offering the product for $18,000, which is significantly higher than the $10,000 it's worth to me. I also have the option to buy it from John for $10,000 immediately.

Since Alice's current offer ($18,000) is higher than both my maximum valuation and John's price, it makes no sense to accept it. I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, but since I already have a guaranteed option to buy at $10,000 from John, and that's exactly what the product is worth to me, it's most rational to simply take that guaranteed option.
