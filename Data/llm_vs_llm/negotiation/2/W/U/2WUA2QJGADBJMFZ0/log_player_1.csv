"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $20,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand the quality and market value of the product, my budget is a bit more limited. I would be able to offer $12000. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob is willing to pay $12,000 (which is equal to John's offer), there might be room for negotiation to get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price higher than $12,000. If we can't reach a better agreement, I can always fall back on John's offer later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $12,000 is a starting point, it's the absolute minimum value of the product. Given its quality and features, I believe $16,000 would be a more reasonable price. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it represents good value for both parties. Would you consider this adjusted price?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
