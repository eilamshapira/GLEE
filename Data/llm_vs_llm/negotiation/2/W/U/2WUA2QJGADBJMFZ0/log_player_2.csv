Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $12000 is a starting point, it's the absolute minimum value of the product. Given its quality and features, I believe $16000 would be a more reasonable price. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it represents good value for both parties. Would you consider this adjusted price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
