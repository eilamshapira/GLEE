"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $17000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth and I'm open to negotiations.",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $17000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to lower my initial price to $16000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $16000, but it's still above what I'm looking to spend. I can stretch my budget a bit more and offer $11000. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget. However, $11000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I can offer the product to you for $13500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11500. Let's see if we can make this work.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $11500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $14000. This is as low as I'm comfortable going. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $14000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000, which is my final offer. Let me know if you can accept this.",12000.0,Bob,8,
