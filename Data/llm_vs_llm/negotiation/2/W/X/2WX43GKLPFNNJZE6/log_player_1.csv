Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $17000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me and even lower than its worth to Bob, I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have a chance to negotiate a better price with Bob, and if that doesn't work out, I have the option to sell to John for $15,000. 

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to lower my initial price to $16,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11500. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Since Bob's offer of $11,500 is still lower than the product's worth to me and even lower than its worth to Bob, I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. However, I notice that Bob is only increasing his offer in small increments, which suggests that he may not be willing to meet me at a price that I'm comfortable with. I'll make one more attempt to negotiate a better price, but if that doesn't work out, I may need to consider selling to John for $15,000.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $11,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $14000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000, which is my final offer. Let me know if you can accept this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is still lower than the product's worth to me, and he has stated that it is his final offer, I don't see any further room for negotiation. Additionally, Bob's offer is equal to the product's worth to him, so I don't think he will be willing to go any higher. Given that I have a better offer from John for $15,000, I will choose to sell the product to John instead. This will allow me to maximize my profit and get a better return on the product's value."
