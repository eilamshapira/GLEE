"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","The current offer is $950,000. My maximum willingness to pay is $1,000,000. Buying from John costs $1,000,000.

If I reject, I enter a negotiation. This could lead to a better price, but also the risk of no deal and potentially buying from John for $1,000,000 if negotiations fail.

Since $950,000 is below my maximum price and also less expensive than buying from John, I should accept the offer.
