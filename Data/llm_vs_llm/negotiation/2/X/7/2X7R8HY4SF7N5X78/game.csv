"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1350000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I believe $1350000 is a bit high. Given market conditions, I would like to propose $1100000 as a fair price. This represents a significant profit margin for you while being more aligned with current market values.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1100000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1275000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair return on a product of this caliber.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1275000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with, I can move up to $1175000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and would provide you with a healthy profit margin. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to reaching a deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1225000. This is a firm offer, reflecting the product's true worth and my desire to conclude this negotiation.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
