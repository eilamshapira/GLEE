"Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Looking at the options:

Alice is offering the product for $149, which is more than the maximum value of $120 that it's worth to me.

Meanwhile, John is willing to sell the same product for $120, which is equal to the maximum value I place on the product.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and John's offer is $29 less than Alice's, the best decision is to buy from John.
