"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation of my strategy:**

*   **Anchoring High:** I'm starting high, significantly above both my minimum acceptable price and Bob's valuation. This is to test his interest level and establish a high anchor point for negotiations.
*   **Knowing My Walkaway:** I am very clear on my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000 from John). This prevents me from accepting a deal that's unfavorable.
*   **Time Pressure:** I have 10 rounds, but I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob is unwilling to negotiate reasonably.
*   **Assessing Bob's Position:** I want to see his reaction to this initial offer. Does he outright reject it? Does he counter immediately? The response will give me clues about his willingness to negotiate and his perceived value of the product."
