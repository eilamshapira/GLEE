Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you today. I believe it's a valuable item and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This price reflects its quality and worth. Would you be interested in making this purchase?,180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $180 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $60 for the product. Let me know if that works for you!",60.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $60 is too low for this product's value. I can offer it to you for $150, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. Would this work better for you?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the new offer, Alice. $150 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $70? That's the highest I can go while still feeling it's a fair deal for both of us.",70.0,Bob,4,
