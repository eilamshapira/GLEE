Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $180 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $60 for the product. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the new offer, Alice. $150 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $70? That's the highest I can go while still feeling it's a fair deal for both of us.

I will sell to John for $100. Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and he's only increased his offer by $10 from $60 to $70, suggesting he's unlikely to reach a price point that would be profitable for me. John's guaranteed offer of $100 is the better business decision."
