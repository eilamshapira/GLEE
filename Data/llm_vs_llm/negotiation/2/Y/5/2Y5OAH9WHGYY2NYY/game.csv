"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $60. What do you say?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $105? Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $80?  That's a significant jump from my initial offer and a price I'm comfortable with.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $80 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
