Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $80 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $90, and I'm sticking to my $80 maximum. It's time to go with John's offer."
