"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000, and also higher than John's guaranteed price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to negotiate a better price with Alice, while keeping John's offer as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 600000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $600,000. This is below my maximum value of $800,000 and gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's offer. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground, but I always have John's $800,000 offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,450,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000). While Alice did reduce the price by $50,000, the reduction is too small and the price is still far too high. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, as there's still room for negotiation and several rounds left. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 650000}

I'll increase my previous offer by $50,000 to show some flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This offer of $650,000 is still well below my maximum value and John's price, giving me room to negotiate further if needed. It also signals to Alice that I'm willing to move up in price, but at a reasonable pace. If Alice continues to maintain very high prices, I can always take John's offer of $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,400,000 is still far above both my maximum value and John's price. While Alice has shown some movement by reducing the price another $50,000, we're still $600,000 above John's offer. Given that we're halfway through our negotiation rounds and Alice's prices remain significantly higher than my target range, I'll reject and make another counteroffer. However, if Alice doesn't make more substantial price reductions soon, I'll need to consider taking John's offer of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'll increase my offer to $700,000, showing continued willingness to negotiate upward. This is a $50,000 increase from my last offer, maintaining the same pace of increases. The price is still below both my maximum value and John's price, but we're running out of rounds, so I'm making a more substantial move to try to reach an agreement. If Alice continues to maintain prices well above $800,000, I'll likely need to switch to John's offer soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $800,000. Here's why:
1. We've gone through 7 rounds, and Alice's price is still $1,350,000, which is $550,000 above John's price
2. Alice's price reductions have been small ($50,000 each time) and at this rate, we won't reach a price near $800,000 in the remaining rounds
3. The risk of continuing negotiations with Alice isn't worth it when we have a guaranteed option at $800,000 from John
4. Even though $800,000 is my maximum value for the product, it's better to secure this price now rather than risk running out of rounds and potentially having to pay even more."
