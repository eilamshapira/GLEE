"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product.  I'm willing to let it go for $110.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $60 for it. Let me know if we can work something out.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $60 was a bit low, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of your offer and my previous offer, so how about $72.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",72.5,Bob,4,
