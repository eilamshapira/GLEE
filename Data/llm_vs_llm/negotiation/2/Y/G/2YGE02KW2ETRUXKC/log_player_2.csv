"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product available for you. I'm offering it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's too early to accept. Alice is starting at your maximum price, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 
I'm starting with a counteroffer a bit below the midpoint between our ideal prices. This gives us some room to negotiate but shows I'm serious about buying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, which is good.  We're still a bit far apart, so I'll continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""It seems like we're getting closer, Alice. How about $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

I'm moving closer to her price, but in smaller increments to show I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your patience, Bob. Let's make this a fair deal at $125. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a reasonable price and fairly close to my goal. It's not worth risking John's offer for a potential $5 saving."
