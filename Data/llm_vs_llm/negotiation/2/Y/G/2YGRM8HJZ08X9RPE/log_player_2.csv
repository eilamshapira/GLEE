"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $80 to you, so I'm offering it to you at a very competitive price of $100. Let me know if you're interested!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no point in paying $100."
