"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Since you have another option to buy the product from John for the same price, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting allows you to explore other options or potentially negotiate with Alice further."
