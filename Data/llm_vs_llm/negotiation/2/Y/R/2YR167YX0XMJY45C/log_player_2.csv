"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. Considering its value and the demand, I'm offering it to you for $25000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that my maximum value for the product is $8,000 and John is willing to sell it at exactly that price, Alice's offer of $25,000 is way too high. It's more than three times my maximum value. While I could reject and make a counteroffer, Alice's initial offer is so far from my acceptable range that it might be more efficient to simply buy from John.
