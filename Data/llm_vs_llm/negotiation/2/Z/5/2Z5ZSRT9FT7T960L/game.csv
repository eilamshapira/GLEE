"Hi Bob, I'm selling a really unique product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Is that something you'd be open to?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $175. This is a really special product, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $175, but it's still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle between my previous offer and John's offer, which is $135. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $135 is still too low for me. I'm willing to drop the price to $160. This is a one-time offer.  If you're really interested, let's close the deal.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your one-time offer, but $160 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. Considering John's offer is $150, I'm willing to pay $145 for the product from you, as I'd rather buy it from you. Is that something you'd be open to?",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $145 is just not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $155 for the product. It's the lowest I can go.  Let me know if you're interested.",155.0,Alice,7,
