"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's quite steep. I'm looking to spend no more than $1000000. Let's find some middle ground. How about $600000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to find middle ground. However, I still believe the product's value exceeds your offer. Considering your maximum budget is $1000000, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $1200000, which is still below my initial asking price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate the increase, but I still think we can do better. Considering your maximum budget and the product's value, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $1050000, which is a more reasonable compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress. However, I still think the product's value warrants a higher price. Considering your offer of $850000 and my previous offer, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $975000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",975000.0,Alice,7,
