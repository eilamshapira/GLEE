"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's quite steep. I'm looking to spend no more than $1000000. Let's find some middle ground. How about $600000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob is willing to spend up to $1,000,000 and his initial counteroffer is $600,000, I believe there's room for further negotiation to reach a higher price closer to my initial offer or at least closer to Bob's maximum spending limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to find middle ground. However, I still believe the product's value exceeds your offer. Considering your maximum budget is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $1,200,000, which is still below my initial asking price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down, Alice, but that's still a bit high. I'm willing to raise my offer to $700000 to meet you in the middle 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, and I believe there's still room for further negotiation. Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,000,000, I'll try to get closer to that amount. Rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer seems like the best option to maximize the sale price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate the increase, but I still think we can do better. Considering your maximum budget and the product's value, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $1,050,000, which is a more reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're getting closer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I can only go as high as $850000. Let's make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to a reasonable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. Since Bob has increased his offer significantly, I'll try to push for a bit more. Rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer seems like the best option to maximize the sale price, considering John's offer is still higher than Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress. However, I still think the product's value warrants a higher price. Considering your offer of $850,000 and my previous offer, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 975000}"
