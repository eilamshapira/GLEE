Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $15,000 to him and $10,000 to me, I'll start with a high price to leave room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

{""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Let me analyze the situation:
- Bob's offer of $12,000 is better than John's fixed price of $10,000
- However, since Bob was willing to counteroffer, he's showing interest and might be willing to go higher
- The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so there's still room for negotiation
- I should try one more counter-offer to see if I can get a better price

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob countered with $12,000, I'll try to meet somewhere in the middle between his offer and my initial price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still trying to maximize my profit.

{""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Let me analyze this new situation:
- Bob has increased his offer by $500, showing he's willing to negotiate upward
- $12,500 is a good price, significantly better than John's $10,000
- If I reject, there's a risk Bob might get frustrated and walk away
- The gap between our last positions has narrowed ($13,000 vs $12,500)
- This is a reasonable price that gives me a good profit
