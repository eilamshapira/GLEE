"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $15,000
2. Alice's initial offer is $12,000
3. John's fixed price is $15,000
4. Alice's offer is $3,000 less than John's price
5. Alice's offer is already below my maximum value
6. While I could try to negotiate for an even lower price, $12,000 is already a good deal
7. There's a risk that if I reject and make a counteroffer, Alice might increase the price or become less flexible

Given these factors, Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is quite reasonable and significantly better than John's price. It would be wise to accept this offer rather than risk losing it through further negotiation.
