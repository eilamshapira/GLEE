"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know if you'd like to take it at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice is offering the product for $120, which is less than the $150 maximum I'm willing to pay and also less than John's price of $150. This is a good offer since it saves me $30 compared to buying from John.
