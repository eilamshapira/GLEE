"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1100000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to counter with $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints. Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $900000. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000, considering the product's value and our initial discussion. I believe this price is more reflective of its worth to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $1050000 is closer, but I'm still trying to stay within a tighter budget. How about we settle at $950000? This would be a significant step towards meeting in the middle, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if this works for you!",950000.0,Bob,4,
