Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1100000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to counter with $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price. My next offer will be $1,050,000. This is still below the product's worth to Bob but closer to my initial offer, giving us room for further negotiation if needed."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $900,000. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000, considering the product's value and our initial discussion. I believe this price is more reflective of its worth to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $1050000 is closer, but I'm still trying to stay within a tighter budget. How about we settle at $950000? This would be a significant step towards meeting in the middle, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I've decided to accept Bob's offer of $950,000. This price is closer to my target and still significantly higher than the $800,000 I could get from selling to John. It seems like a fair compromise after our negotiations, and I believe it's in my best interest to close the deal at this point."
