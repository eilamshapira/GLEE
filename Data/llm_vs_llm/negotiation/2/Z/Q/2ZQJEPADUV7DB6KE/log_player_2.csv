"Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $17,000, which is significantly above my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $12,000, which matches my maximum value
4. Even if I continue negotiating with Alice, there's no guarantee she'll go below $12,000 since the product is worth $15,000 to her

The logical choice is to buy from John, as his price meets my maximum value and is better than Alice's current offer. Continuing negotiations with Alice is unlikely to result in a better deal since her cost is higher than John's price.
