"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that Bob values the product at $120 and my minimum acceptable price is $100, I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

{""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $95 is below both my minimum acceptable price ($100) and John's guaranteed offer ($100), there's no reason to accept it. I also know Bob values the product at $120, so there's potential for a better deal than John's $100. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still maintain a price that would give me better profit than John's offer, while being attractive to Bob given his $120 valuation.

{""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer of $100 is exactly the same as John's guaranteed offer. Since we're already in round 4 out of 10, and there's risk in continuing negotiations (Bob might lower his offer or walk away), I'll accept Bob's offer. This meets my minimum acceptable price and eliminates any further negotiation risk.
