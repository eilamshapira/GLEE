"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an exclusive product that I believe could be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $2000000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $2,000,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within my budget.
