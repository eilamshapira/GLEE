Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000. I believe this is a fair price, considering my budget and the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
