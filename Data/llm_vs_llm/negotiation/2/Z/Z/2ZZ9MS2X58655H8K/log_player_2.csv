"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1500000. This is a one-time opportunity, so please let me know if you're interested. Otherwise, I will proceed with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's initial offer is $1,500,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. I'd like to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, I'll offer a price that is slightly lower, hoping to negotiate a better deal.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering my budget and the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
