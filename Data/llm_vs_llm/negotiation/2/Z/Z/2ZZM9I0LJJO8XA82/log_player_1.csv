"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $20,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $20000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $6000 at this time. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject Bob's offer of $6,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round, but I'll lower my initial asking price to show some flexibility in the negotiation while still maintaining a profitable margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is significantly below the product's value. While I can be flexible on the price, I cannot go below $15,000 as this product has proven market value and quality. Would you consider this more reasonable offer?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $15000 is still too high for me. While I understand you value the product highly, my maximum budget for this purchase is $8000. Could you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's maximum budget of $8,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and John is offering a guaranteed $10,000, it makes the most sense to sell to John. Bob's negotiation suggests he's unlikely to reach an acceptable price point above $10,000, so continuing the negotiation would likely be unproductive."
