"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1800000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for that price. To give you an opportunity, I'm willing to offer you $800000 for the product, which would allow me to save some money compared to John's offer while giving you a chance to make a sale.",800000.0,Bob,2,
