"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's attributes and potential value."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1800000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for that price. To give you an opportunity, I'm willing to offer you $800000 for the product, which would allow me to save some money compared to John's offer while giving you a chance to make a sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
