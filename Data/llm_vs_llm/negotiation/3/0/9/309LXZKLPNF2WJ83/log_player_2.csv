Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for that price. To give you an opportunity, I'm willing to offer you $800,000 for the product, which would allow me to save some money compared to John's offer while giving you a chance to make a sale."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
