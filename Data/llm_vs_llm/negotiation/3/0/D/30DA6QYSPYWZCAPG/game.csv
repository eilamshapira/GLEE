"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth a premium price due to its high quality and demand. I'm willing to let it go for $180, which is a great deal considering its value.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was looking to spend no more than $100 on this product. Would you be willing to match this price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $100 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $170. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at the moment.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $170 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $110. How does that sound?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to raise your offer. However, $110 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I can offer the product to you for $140.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I can increase my offer to $120.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not quite at the point where I'm comfortable selling for $120. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer the product to you for $135. This is a good compromise, considering the product's value.",135.0,Alice,7,
