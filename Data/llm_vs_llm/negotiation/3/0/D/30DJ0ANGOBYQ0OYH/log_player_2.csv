"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully. She is offering the product for $180, which is more than the $120 I value it at. John (not Jhon as mentioned in the prompt) is willing to sell me the same product for $120, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and Alice's offer exceeds both my valuation and John's price, the logical choice is to buy from John.
