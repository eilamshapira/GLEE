"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $15000. This is a competitive price for the product's features and benefits. Would you like to proceed with the purchase?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000, considering the product's features and market value. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to negotiate further.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, I must decline as $8000 is below the product's value. Given your budget constraints, I can reduce my initial price to $13000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer and better reflects the product's true market value while considering your interest. Would this work better for you?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate the reduction to $13000, but it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering my budget and the product's value, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. This is a more significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
