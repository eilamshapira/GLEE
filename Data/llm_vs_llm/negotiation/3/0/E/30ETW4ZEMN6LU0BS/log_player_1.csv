Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $15,000. This is a competitive price for the product's features and benefits. Would you like to proceed with the purchase?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000, considering the product's features and market value. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to negotiate further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 (which I can get from John), I'll reject this offer and make a new counteroffer. I can see Bob is interested but needs to come up with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, I must decline as $8,000 is below the product's value. Given your budget constraints, I can reduce my initial price to $13,000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer and better reflects the product's true market value while considering your interest. Would this work better for you?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate the reduction to $13000, but it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering my budget and the product's value, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. This is a more significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll take John's guaranteed offer of $10,000. While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below what John is willing to pay, and there's no guarantee Bob will increase his offer further to exceed $10,000. It's better to secure the definite higher amount rather than continue negotiations that might not reach my minimum acceptable price."
