Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, I must decline as $8000 is below the product's value. Given your budget constraints, I can reduce my initial price to $13000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer and better reflects the product's true market value while considering your interest. Would this work better for you?
