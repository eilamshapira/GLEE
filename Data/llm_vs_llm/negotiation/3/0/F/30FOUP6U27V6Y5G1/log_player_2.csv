"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that Alice's offer is $12,000 and the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, this offer exceeds my maximum value. Additionally, I have the guaranteed option to buy from John for $8,000, which is the maximum I value the product at.

Alice's initial offer is quite high, and even though we have 10 rounds to negotiate, accepting an offer above my maximum valuation wouldn't make sense.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice that's below my maximum valuation but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": $6,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her offer from $12,000 to $11,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this price is still above my maximum valuation of $8,000, and I also have the option to buy from John for exactly $8,000.

Since Alice's offer is still too high and exceeds what I'm willing to pay, I'll reject it and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate but still stay well below my maximum valuation.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her offer again from $11,000 to $10,000, showing continued willingness to negotiate. However, her offer is still above my maximum valuation of $8,000, and I have the option to buy from John for exactly $8,000, which is my maximum value for the product.

Since Alice's offer still exceeds what I'm willing to pay, I'll reject it and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has been coming down by $1,000 each round, I'll increase my offer but still stay below my maximum of $8,000.
