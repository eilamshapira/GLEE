"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my exclusive product for $2000000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value asset, and I'm confident it will meet your expectations. I look forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $2,000,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $1,200,000, which matches my maximum value

Since Alice's offer ($2,000,000) is substantially higher than both my maximum value and John's price, it would not be rational to accept it. While I could make a counteroffer, there's no guarantee Alice would come down to a price below John's offer. Therefore, the most logical decision is to buy from John.
