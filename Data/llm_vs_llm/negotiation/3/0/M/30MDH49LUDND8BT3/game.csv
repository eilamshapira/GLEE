"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $7000 is lower than I can accept. How about we meet in the middle a bit? I'd be willing to let it go for $9000. That's a $1000 discount off my initial price, and still provides you with a $1000 value gain.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the discount, but I still think we can do better. Considering your initial price and the value I'll gain from the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. How about $8000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
