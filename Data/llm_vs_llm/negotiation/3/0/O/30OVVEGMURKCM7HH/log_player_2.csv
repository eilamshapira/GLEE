{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if I can get a lower price. There's no downside to rejecting this offer and moving to the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. $9,000 is a good starting point, and leaves room for potential compromises."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving in the right direction, but I'm still hoping to get a lower price. I'll try another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still significantly lower than Alice's current price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm serious about getting the product at a fair price."
