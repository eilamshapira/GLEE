"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the lowest I can go on this product is $120. It's a great deal for the value you're getting. Let me know if this works for you!",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and John's price. I can offer $70 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",70.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground. I can come down to $110, which is still a good deal considering the product's value. Let me know if you can meet me at this price!",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $110 is still above my budget. I'm willing to stretch a bit and meet you closer to John's price. I can offer $75 for the product. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider buying from John. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",75.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget. The best I can do at this point is $105. This is very close to John's offer, but you'll be getting the product directly from me. Let me know if this works for you!",105.0,Alice,7,
