"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12000 is quite high for me. I know the market well, and I have another seller offering the same product for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider selling it for $6500?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $6500 is significantly below its value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could we meet in the middle at $9500?",9500.0,Alice,3,
