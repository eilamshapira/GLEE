Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12000 is quite high for me. I know the market well, and I have another seller offering the same product for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider selling it for $6500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $6,500 is significantly below its value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could we meet in the middle at $9,500?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
