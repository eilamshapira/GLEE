"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: The offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than my maximum valuation of $8,000. It's also higher than John's guaranteed price of $8,000. It would be logical to either make a counteroffer to Alice that's below $8,000 (since that's my maximum value) or buy from John. For now, I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price than John's $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12,000 is quite high for me. I know the market well, and I have another seller offering the same product for $8,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider selling it for $6,500?"", ""product_price"": 6500}

Reasoning: I'm making a counteroffer that:
1. Is below John's price of $8,000 (which gives me room to negotiate up if needed)
2. Mentions the alternative offer I have ($8,000) to establish my BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement)
3. Shows willingness to negotiate while starting low enough to allow for back-and-forth
4. Is polite and professional while being firm on price
5. Stays well below my maximum value of $8,000 to ensure I can still make a profit"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $6500 is significantly below its value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could we meet in the middle at $9500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Reasoning: At this point, it's best to buy from John because:
1. Alice's new offer of $9,500 is still above my maximum value of $8,000
2. Alice came down from $12,000 to $9,500, but that's still $1,500 more than John's price
3. The negotiation pattern suggests Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000, as her counteroffer is still well above that price
4. John's guaranteed price of $8,000 is at my maximum value point
5. Continuing negotiations with Alice might waste time when we have a viable option at $8,000

It makes economic sense to take John's offer rather than continue negotiations or accept a price above my maximum value."
