Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob now.

I need to consider that the minimum value of the product to me is $80, and if Bob rejects my offer, I'm guaranteed to get $80 from John. Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I should set a price that's high enough to give me more profit than my guaranteed $80, but not so high that Bob will definitely reject it.
