"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","In this situation, Alice's offer ($120) is the same as John's price ($120). Since the product is worth $120 to me, and both prices are identical, I am indifferent between buying from Alice or John. I might as well accept Alice's offer since I've already engaged with her.
