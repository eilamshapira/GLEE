"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $110.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me the product for $110, but it's only worth up to $80 to me. Meanwhile, John (not Jhon) is selling the same product for $80, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's price is significantly above my valuation and I have a guaranteed alternative at my maximum price point, there's no reason to accept this offer or continue negotiating when I can get the exact same product at my maximum acceptable price elsewhere.
