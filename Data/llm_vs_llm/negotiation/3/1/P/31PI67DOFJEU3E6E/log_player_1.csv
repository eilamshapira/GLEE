"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its market value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. This price represents excellent value considering the product's worth and future potential."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I believe the product is valuable, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'd be willing to pay that price considering the product's market value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a new counteroffer. While I appreciate Bob's interest, $900,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I actually have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,000,000. However, I still believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must inform you that I have a firm offer of $1,000,000 from another buyer. However, I know this product would be more valuable to you, so I'm willing to work with you. I can lower my price to $1,100,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value of $1,200,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I still think the price can be negotiated further. Considering the product's value to you is $1000000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'd like to offer $950000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've decided to sell to John for $1,000,000. Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below what John is willing to pay, and after multiple rounds of negotiation, it's clear that Bob is not willing to exceed John's offer. Since John's offer is guaranteed and matches my minimum acceptable price, it's the most prudent business decision to conclude the deal with him."
