"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,800,000. This gives me a good starting point to negotiate from and hopefully leaves room for a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I need to close a deal, $1,400,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price and even less than what John is offering. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,650,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum and closer to my desired price. I hope this shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise while still getting a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. It's becoming clear that he's not willing to pay close to my minimum price. I'm going to continue negotiating, but I'm also considering selling to John. I need to see how this round goes before I make a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,550,000. This is still above my minimum, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. If Bob is serious about buying, he'll need to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my limit. Bob's offer is too low, and it's clear he's not willing to meet my price. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation that is unlikely to be successful."
