"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $25000 is well above what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $15000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for exactly $15000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $12000? This would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a reasonable deal considering the product is worth $15000 to you.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, I can't go as low as $12000. Given the value and the unique benefits of this product, and also considering my expenses, the lowest I can go is $23000.",23000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $23000 is still far above what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, this product is only worth $15000 to me, and I already have John's offer at exactly that price. I'd like to work with you instead, but I need a better price than what John is offering. My best offer is $13500 - this saves me some money compared to John's price while still giving you a reasonable profit. If we can't agree on a price below $15000, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.",13500.0,Bob,4,
