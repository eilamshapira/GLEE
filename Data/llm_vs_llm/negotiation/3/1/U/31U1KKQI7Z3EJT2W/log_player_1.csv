Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! Considering its value and unique features, I'm offering it to you for $25,000."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $25000 is well above what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $15000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for exactly $15000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $12000? This would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a reasonable deal considering the product is worth $15000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Okay, I need to make a decision. Bob's offer is too low. I also want to earn more than $15,000 from this product. Therefore, I will reject his offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, I can't go as low as $12,000. Given the value and the unique benefits of this product, and also considering my expenses, the lowest I can go is $23,000."", ""product_price"": 23000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $23000 is still far above what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, this product is only worth $15000 to me, and I already have John's offer at exactly that price. I'd like to work with you instead, but I need a better price than what John is offering. My best offer is $13500 - this saves me some money compared to John's price while still giving you a reasonable profit. If we can't agree on a price below $15000, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Okay, this is a crucial decision point. Bob's offer is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I need to consider my options. I could try to negotiate further, but I am risking losing the sale to John. Given that I can sell to John for $15,000, I am going to reject Bob's offer and sell to John.
