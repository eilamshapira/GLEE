"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! Considering its value and unique features, I'm offering it to you for $25000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than the $15,000 that the product is worth to me. Also, I can already buy the exact same product from John for $15,000. There's no reason for me to accept this offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $25,000 is well above what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for exactly $15,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $12,000? This would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a reasonable deal considering the product is worth $15,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, I can't go as low as $12000. Given the value and the unique benefits of this product, and also considering my expenses, the lowest I can go is $23000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $23,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $23,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's revised offer of $23,000 is still significantly higher than the $15,000 that the product is worth to me, and it's also higher than John's guaranteed price of $15,000. There's no reason for me to accept this offer when I can get the same product for $8,000 less from John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $23,000 is still far above what makes sense for me. As I mentioned, this product is only worth $15,000 to me, and I already have John's offer at exactly that price. I'd like to work with you instead, but I need a better price than what John is offering. My best offer is $13,500 - this saves me some money compared to John's price while still giving you a reasonable profit. If we can't agree on a price below $15,000, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
