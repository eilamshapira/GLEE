"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this exclusive product for $140. I believe it's a fair deal given its value. Let me know if you'd like to proceed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and Alice's initial offer is $140, which is close to my maximum budget, I'll consider rejecting the offer to see if I can get a better deal. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, to see how much she is willing to negotiate. Since Alice's offer was $140, I'll offer $120, which is still a reasonable price but gives me some room to save money.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. Considering the excellent value of this product, I'm prepared to offer it to you for $135. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $135 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with. Since I initially offered $120 and Alice rejected it, I'll try to meet her halfway between my offer and her new price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a new counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous offer of $120, but still lower than Alice's current offer of $135. I'll offer $125, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Alice's new price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your revised offer. I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 125}"
