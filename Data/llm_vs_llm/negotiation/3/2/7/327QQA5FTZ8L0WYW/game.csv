"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 feels a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
"Bob's offer of $80 matches my backup option with John. However, since my goal is to maximize revenue and there's a possibility that Bob values the product at more than $80, I'll reject his offer and send him a counteroffer. I'll propose a price higher than $80 (say, $90) in the next round. This way, if Bob has a higher willingness to pay, I can earn more than $80. Otherwise, I still have the option to walk away and sell to John at $80.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
