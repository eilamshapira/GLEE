Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $100. Let me know if you'd like to purchase it at that price or if you'd prefer to negotiate. Thanks!"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 feels a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Bob's offer of $80 matches my backup option with John. However, since my goal is to maximize revenue and there's a possibility that Bob values the product at more than $80, I'll reject his offer and send him a counteroffer. I'll propose a price higher than $80 (say, $90) in the next round. This way, if Bob has a higher willingness to pay, I can earn more than $80. Otherwise, I still have the option to walk away and sell to John at $80.""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. How about we meet at $90 for the product? Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 90}"
