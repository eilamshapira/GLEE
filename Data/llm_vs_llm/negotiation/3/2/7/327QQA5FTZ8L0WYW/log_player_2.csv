"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $100. Let me know if you'd like to purchase it at that price or if you'd prefer to negotiate. Thanks! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's first offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  It's worth seeing if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 feels a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $80?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. How about we meet at $90 for the product? Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

$90 is a fair price, and it saves me $30 compared to John's offer. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, so it's best to accept now."
