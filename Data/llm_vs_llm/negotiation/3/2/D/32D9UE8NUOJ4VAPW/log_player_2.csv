"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the opportunity to acquire this unique and valuable product. Considering its exceptional quality and potential, I'm prepared to sell it to you for a price of... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,500,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $1,100,000
3. John's fixed price is $1,500,000

Alice's offer ($1,100,000) is:
- $400,000 less than my maximum value
- $400,000 less than John's price

This is a good deal because:
1. It's well below my maximum value
2. It saves me $400,000 compared to buying from John
3. The price seems reasonable

Therefore, I should accept Alice's offer.
