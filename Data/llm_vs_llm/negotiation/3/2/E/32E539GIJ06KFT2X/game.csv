"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I think $1800000 is a bit steep. How about we settle the price at $1000000 instead?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but this product truly offers exceptional value.  I've already got another buyer lined up at $1200000, so I can't go any lower than $1600000. This is a fair price reflecting its worth.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your position, but $1600000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $1100000 to meet you in the middle.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  My alternative buyer is a sure thing, so $1400000 is my absolute lowest.  This is a final offer.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
