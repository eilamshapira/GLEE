"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on its features and market value, I'm offering it at $25000. This product has excellent quality and durability that makes it worth the investment. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $25000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've described. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot sell the product for $12000. The quality and features of this product justify a higher price point. I understand budget constraints, but I need to ensure I receive fair value. I can come down to $22000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the true worth of the product. Does this work better for you?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $22000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $17000. This is a good compromise and allows us both to come to an agreement.  What do you say?",17000.0,Bob,4,
