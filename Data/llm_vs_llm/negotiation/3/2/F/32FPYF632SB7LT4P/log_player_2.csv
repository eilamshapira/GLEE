Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot sell the product for $12000. The quality and features of this product justify a higher price point. I understand budget constraints, but I need to ensure I receive fair value. I can come down to $22000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the true worth of the product. Does this work better for you?
