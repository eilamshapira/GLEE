"Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I think it's quite valuable, and I'm sure you'll find it useful. My initial asking price is $250. Let me know what you think.",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $250 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $100 at this time. Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $100 is too low for me. My bottom line is $180. How about we meet in the middle at $215?",215.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $215 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $150. If you're open to that, we can make a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to go with another option.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Okay Bob, $150 is still a little lower than I'd hoped, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit more. How about $170? That's the lowest I can reasonably go.",170.0,Alice,5,
