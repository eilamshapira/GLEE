"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $150, which is a fair price considering its quality and features."",
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Starting with a high initial offer ($150) leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired profit margin.  Even though it's significantly higher than Bob's valuation, it establishes a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm actually looking to spend no more than $60 on this product. I think that's a fair price for me. Would you be willing to sell it for $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is too low. Accepting would mean a significant loss compared to selling to John. It's better to negotiate further or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly below the product's value. I could meet you halfway. How about $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm aiming for a more collaborative tone by suggesting we ""meet halfway."" This might make Bob more receptive.
* **Strategic Price:**  $105 is a strong counteroffer. It's a significant decrease from my initial offer but still a good profit margin. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping John in mind. If Bob doesn't agree to a price close to this range, selling to John becomes the more attractive option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, after some thought, I can raise my offer to $65. This is still quite reasonable from my perspective. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob increased his offer slightly, $65 is still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm better off continuing the negotiation or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  To be transparent, I have another offer for $100. Could you meet me at $95? This would be my final offer."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Urgency:**  By mentioning John's offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and showing Bob I'm serious about my bottom line. 
* **Final Offer Tactic:**  Presenting this as my ""final offer"" adds weight to the negotiation.
* **Slight Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price to $95, which is a compromise, but it's essential to stand firm near my minimum acceptable price."
