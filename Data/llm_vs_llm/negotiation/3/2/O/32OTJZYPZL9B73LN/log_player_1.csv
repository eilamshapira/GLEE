"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since the product is worth $15,000 to me (as I can sell it to John for that price), and knowing that Bob values it at $8,000, I'll start with a high offer but leave some room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $5,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and even his own valuation ($8,000). This appears to be a lowball offer. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, there's no reason to accept such a low offer or continue negotiations with someone who's not making serious offers.
