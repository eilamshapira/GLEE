Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:**  The offer acknowledges the product's worth, justifying the high price while keeping in mind John's guaranteed purchase."
