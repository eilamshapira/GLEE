"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1300000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to consider the options carefully:

The product is worth at most $800,000 to me.
Alice is offering it for $1,300,000, which is $500,000 more than its worth to me.
John is willing to sell me the exact same product for $800,000.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and John's offer matches the maximum value of the product to me, I should choose option 3.
