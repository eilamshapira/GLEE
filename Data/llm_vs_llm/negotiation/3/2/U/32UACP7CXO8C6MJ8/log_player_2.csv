"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this situation:

Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is $300,000 less than John's fixed price of $1,500,000. Since the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, Alice's offer is already providing me with savings.

While I could try to negotiate further with Alice by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer, there's a risk involved. If negotiations break down, I might have to pay John's higher price of $1,500,000.

Given that Alice's initial offer already saves me $300,000 compared to John's price, and the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, accepting Alice's offer seems like the most prudent decision.
