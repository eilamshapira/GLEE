"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is less than the $15,000 maximum value to me and also less than John's fixed price of $15,000. This is already a good deal since I'm saving $3,000 compared to buying from John.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and Alice's initial offer is already below my maximum value, it makes sense to accept this offer.
