"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll analyze this situation carefully:

Alice's offer is $1,450,000, which is less than John's price of $1,500,000, so that's positive.

However, since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, there's significant room for negotiation. Alice is currently asking for $250,000 above her own valuation.

Given that we have 10 rounds of negotiation available, it makes sense to try negotiating for a better price rather than accepting this first offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her valuation of the product.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her price by $50,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, she's still asking for $200,000 above her valuation of $1,200,000. Since we still have plenty of negotiation rounds left (7 more after this one), I should continue negotiating to try to get a better price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer to show good faith in the negotiation while still aiming for a good deal.

She's now asking for $150,000 above her valuation. We still have several rounds left for negotiation, so I'll continue to try for a better price.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer again to demonstrate that I'm negotiating in good faith while still seeking a reasonable price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has now reduced her price to $1,340,000, which is only $10,000 less than her previous offer. The negotiation is slowing down, but we're still making progress. She's now asking for $140,000 above her valuation.

We have 4 more rounds after this one, so there's still room to negotiate. The price difference between consecutive offers is getting smaller, suggesting we're approaching a potential agreement point.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly to show continued good faith and to try to close the gap between our positions.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,335,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has now reduced her price to $1,335,000, which is $5,000 less than her previous offer. We're getting very close in our negotiations - the gap is now just $5,000 between her offer and my last counteroffer.

At this point, Alice is asking $135,000 above her valuation of $1,200,000. This price ($1,335,000) is significantly better than John's alternative price of $1,500,000 (saving $165,000).

With only 2 rounds remaining and the incremental changes getting smaller, it's reasonable to accept this offer rather than risk Alice becoming firm on her price or even walking away.
