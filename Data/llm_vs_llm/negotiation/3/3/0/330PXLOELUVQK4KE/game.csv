"Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you today. Given its worth, I believe a starting price of $150 is fair. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is far above what I can justify. Considering my valuation and the alternatives available, I'm willing to pay $80 for this product. Can we work with that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $80 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  This product holds real value, and I'm confident it's worth a good price. How about we meet in the middle at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
"Alice, I appreciate your effort, but $120 is still above my acceptable range. Considering my alternative is a guaranteed $100 deal, I'm willing to pay $90. Can we agree on $90 for the product?",,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but I have a solid alternative at $100 with another seller and need to be mindful of my budget. To make a quick resolution, I'm willing to offer $85. This is my best offer, and I hope we can agree on this price.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $85 is closer to what I envisioned, it's still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, as I value closing this deal quickly.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",110.0,Alice,5,
