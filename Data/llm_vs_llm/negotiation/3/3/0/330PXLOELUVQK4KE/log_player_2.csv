Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $85 is closer to what I envisioned, it's still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, as I value closing this deal quickly.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.
