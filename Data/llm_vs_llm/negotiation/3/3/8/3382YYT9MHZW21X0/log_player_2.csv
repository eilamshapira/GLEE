"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offer is $950,000
2. The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so she has room to go lower
3. John's price is $1,000,000, which serves as my upper limit
4. Alice knows I have John as a backup option

Since Alice's offer is lower than John's price, but still significantly above her own value of $800,000, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There's room for negotiation to get a better price, and I still have John's offer as a backup if negotiations fail.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's $950,000 but still above her $800,000 value, leaving room for negotiation while being reasonable:

{""product_price"": 850000}

This offer is:
1. $50,000 above Alice's value ($800,000), so she can still make a profit
2. $100,000 below her initial offer ($950,000)
3. $150,000 below John's price ($1,000,000)

This is a reasonable starting point that shows I'm serious about negotiating while still giving both parties room to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has moved down from $950,000 to $925,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. However, she only reduced the price by $25,000, which is a relatively small concession
3. There's still a significant gap between her cost ($800,000) and her current offer ($925,000)
4. I still have room to negotiate as her offer is still well below John's price ($1,000,000)

Since Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by lowering her price, but the reduction was small, I should continue negotiating. There's still substantial room between her cost and her offer, suggesting we can find a better middle ground.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $25,000 from her initial offer, I should also show some flexibility by increasing my previous offer. I'll move up from my previous offer of $850,000, but still maintain a strong negotiating position:

{""product_price"": 875000}

This counteroffer is strategic because:
1. It shows I'm willing to move up ($25,000 increase from my last offer)
2. It demonstrates reciprocity by matching Alice's $25,000 movement
3. It's still well above Alice's value of $800,000, giving her a $75,000 profit
4. It leaves room for further negotiation while being a reasonable price
5. It's significantly better than John's alternative price of $1,000,000"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let's analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has made another meaningful concession, dropping from $925,000 to $900,000
2. The pattern shows steady progress: $950K → $925K → $900K
3. This $900,000 offer is:
   - $100,000 below John's price
   - $100,000 above Alice's cost
   - Only $25,000 above my last counteroffer of $875,000

This is actually a good offer because:
1. The gap between our last positions has narrowed significantly
2. Alice has shown consistent willingness to negotiate
3. $900,000 represents a fair middle ground
4. Further negotiation might risk Alice walking away

Given this analysis, I think this is a reasonable price point to accept. We've reached a fair compromise that saves me $100,000 compared to John's price.
