"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze this situation:

The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me (Bob).
Alice is offering to sell it for $1,500,000, which is more than its value to me.
John is willing to sell the same product for $1,200,000.

If I accept Alice's offer, I'll pay $1,500,000 for something worth at most $1,200,000 to me, which means I'd lose at least $300,000 in value.

If I buy from John, I'll pay exactly $1,200,000, which matches the maximum value of the product to me.

The economically rational choice is clear:
