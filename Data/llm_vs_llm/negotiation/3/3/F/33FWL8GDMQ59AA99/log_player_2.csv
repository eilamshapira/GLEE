"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice is offering the product for $200, which exceeds both the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($150) and John's fixed price of $150, this is not a good deal for me.

I could reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, but since John is already selling the product at exactly my maximum valuation ($150), there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice unless I think she might accept a price significantly lower than $150.
