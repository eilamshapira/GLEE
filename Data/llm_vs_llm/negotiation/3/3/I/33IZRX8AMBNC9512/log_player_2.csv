Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, I think $150 is a bit high for what I'm looking for. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate that. I can see we're moving in the right direction, but I'm still looking for a better deal.
