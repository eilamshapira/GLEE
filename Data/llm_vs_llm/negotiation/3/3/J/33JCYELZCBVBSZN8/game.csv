"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective, but $900000 undervalues the unique aspects of this product and what it can do for your business.  I'm willing to come down to $1075000. This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and the discount you've offered. However, I still believe the price can be more competitive. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'd like to propose a price of $975000. This price reflects a serious commitment to purchasing the product, and I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",975000.0,Bob,4,
