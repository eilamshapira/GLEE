"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'm considering my options here:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $200 - This exceeds the $80 value the product has to me, so this isn't a good choice.
2. Reject and make a counteroffer - This allows me to continue negotiating for a better price.
3. Buy from John for $80 - This matches the maximum I'm willing to pay.

Since Alice's initial offer of $200 is far above my maximum value of $80, and I can immediately purchase from John at exactly my maximum value, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice unless I believe she would go below $80 (which seems unlikely from her high initial offer).
