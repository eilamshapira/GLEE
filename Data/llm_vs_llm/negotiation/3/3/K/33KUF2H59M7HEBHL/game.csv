"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $10000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $16000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $11000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $14500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",14500.0,Alice,5,
