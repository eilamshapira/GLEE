"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $120 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $80 and higher than John's price. It's better to reject and make a counteroffer in the next round. There's potential to negotiate with Alice for a better price, and I always have the option to buy from John at $80 if negotiations don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 60}

I'll start with a lower counteroffer of $60. This gives room for negotiation while being significantly below my maximum value of $80. If Alice rejects this, we can potentially meet somewhere in the middle, and I still have the fallback option of buying from John at $80 if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has reduced her price from $120 to $100, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but it's still above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. Since Alice has shown willingness to move down in price, we might be able to reach a mutually acceptable price below $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

I'll increase my offer to $70. This is a reasonable increase from my previous offer of $60, showing I'm willing to negotiate in good faith. It's still below my maximum value of $80 and John's price, giving me room to either continue negotiating or fall back to John's offer if needed. Since Alice moved down by $20 in her last offer, I'm moving up by $10 to show reciprocity in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $80. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($90) is still above both my maximum value and John's price
2. While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate down (from $120 to $100 to $90), she's still not moving below $80
3. We've already used half of our negotiation rounds
4. There's no guarantee Alice will go below $80, which is my maximum value
5. John's offer of $80 is guaranteed and matches my maximum value

It's better to secure the deal with John at $80 rather than risk more rounds of negotiation that might not result in a better price."
