"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my exclusive product for $12000. This is a firm offer knowing that it's also the best deal I have, as I have another buyer waiting at that same price. Let me know if you accept.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand you have another buyer interested, I'm looking to purchase this product at a better price. The product is worth $12000 to me, but since John is also selling it at that price, I'd need some incentive to buy from you instead. I'm willing to offer $10500 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us and allow me to choose your product over the alternatives.",10500.0,Bob,2,
