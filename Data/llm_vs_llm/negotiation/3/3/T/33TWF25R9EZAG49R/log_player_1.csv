Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my exclusive product for $12,000. This is a firm offer knowing that it's also the best deal I have, as I have another buyer waiting at that same price. Let me know if you accept."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand you have another buyer interested, I'm looking to purchase this product at a better price. The product is worth $12000 to me, but since John is also selling it at that price, I'd need some incentive to buy from you instead. I'm willing to offer $10500 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us and allow me to choose your product over the alternatives. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
