"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my exclusive product for $12000. This is a firm offer knowing that it's also the best deal I have, as I have another buyer waiting at that same price. Let me know if you accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given the information, Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is the same price that John is offering and equal to the maximum value the product is worth to you.

Since Alice claims she has another buyer waiting at the same price, and John is also offering the exact same price, there's no advantage to buying from one over the other or continuing the negotiation at this point.

However, since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I should try negotiating with Alice before accepting her offer or going to John.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand you have another buyer interested, I'm looking to purchase this product at a better price. The product is worth $12,000 to me, but since John is also selling it at that price, I'd need some incentive to buy from you instead. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us and allow me to choose your product over the alternatives."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
