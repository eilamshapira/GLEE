"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I think $115 is a bit high. I can see similar products available elsewhere for less. I'd be comfortable paying $105 for this product. This gives you $5 profit over your cost, which seems fair. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the quick response, Bob! I understand your perspective. While I can't go down to $105, I'm willing to meet you in the middle a bit. How about $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
