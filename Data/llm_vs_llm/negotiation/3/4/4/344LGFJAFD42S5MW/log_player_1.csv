Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I have a great product I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I think $115 is a bit high. I can see similar products available elsewhere for less. I'd be comfortable paying $105 for this product. This gives you $5 profit over your cost, which seems fair. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Okay, considering Bob's counteroffer, and my goal to maximize profit, I will **reject** his offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the quick response, Bob! I understand your perspective. While I can't go down to $105, I'm willing to meet you in the middle a bit. How about $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
