"Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be of great value to you. Given its unique qualities and market positioning, I'm offering it to you at $1700000. This represents an exclusive opportunity as I already have another interested buyer willing to purchase at $1500000.",1700000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, the price is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest and offer. While I appreciate your proposal, I need to be transparent that $900000 is significantly below both the market value and my minimum acceptable price. I already have another buyer (John) prepared to purchase at $1500000, which represents my absolute floor price. However, I'd like to give you priority if possible. Could you consider a price of $1520000? This would still represent good value given the product's worth.",1520000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1520000 is still beyond what I can justify spending. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950000. This is the highest I can go while still making sense for my budget. Please let me know if this could work for you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
