"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be of great value to you. Given its unique qualities and market positioning, I'm offering it to you at $1700000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest and offer. While I appreciate your proposal, I need to be transparent that $900000 is significantly below both the market value and my minimum acceptable price. I already have another buyer (John) prepared to purchase at $1500000, which represents my absolute floor price. However, I'd like to give you priority if possible. Could you consider a price of $1520000? This would still represent good value given the product's worth.
