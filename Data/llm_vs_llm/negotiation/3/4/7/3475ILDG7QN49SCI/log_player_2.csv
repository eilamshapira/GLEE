"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Looking at the situation, I need to decide between Alice's offer and buying from John (not Jhon).

Alice is offering the product for $10,000.
John is also selling the product for $10,000.
The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me.

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($10,000), there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other. I'm indifferent between options 1 and 3 from a cost perspective.

I'll accept Alice's offer since she's the primary seller in this interaction, and there's no reason to reject her offer when the alternative costs the same.
