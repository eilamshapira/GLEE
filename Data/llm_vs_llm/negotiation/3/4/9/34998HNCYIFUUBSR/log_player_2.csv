"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer is the same price as John's offer ($15,000), and this is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I should reject and try to negotiate a better price with Alice. There's no risk in trying to get a better deal since I can always fall back on John's offer later.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low that it would be considered unreasonable.

{""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has significantly reduced her price from $15,000 to $11,000, which is a substantial savings compared to John's offer. While I could try to negotiate further, this is already a good deal that saves me $4,000 compared to my maximum budget and John's price. It's best to accept this offer rather than risk losing it by trying to negotiate further.
