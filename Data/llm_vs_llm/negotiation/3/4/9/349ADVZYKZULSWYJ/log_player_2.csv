"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'd like to offer you my product. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice's offer is $180, which is $30 more than my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $150, which matches my maximum value
4. Alice's initial offer is too high, and even if I make a counteroffer, there's no guarantee she'll go below $150

Since I can get the product from John for $150 (which is my maximum value), and Alice's offer is significantly higher at $180, the most rational decision is to reject Alice's offer.

Given that I have the guaranteed option to buy from John at my maximum value price, there's no reason to accept a higher price from Alice.
