"Thanks for your offer, Bob. However, $6000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand budget constraints, but I need to ensure a fair price for this high-quality product. I can reduce my initial asking price to $21000, which is a substantial discount. Would this price point work better for you?",21000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the discount, Alice, but $21000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $7000, which is the maximum I can afford for this product. Let me know if you can meet me at this price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
