"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $25,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and market value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $25000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $6000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 (which is what John is willing to pay). I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, coming down from my initial price but still maintaining a profitable margin. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement closer to my target price, I always have the option to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. However, $6,000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand budget constraints, but I need to ensure a fair price for this high-quality product. I can reduce my initial asking price to $21,000, which is a substantial discount. Would this price point work better for you?"", ""product_price"": 21000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the discount, Alice, but $21000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $7000, which is the maximum I can afford for this product. Let me know if you can meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I choose to sell to John for $15,000. Bob's maximum offer of $7,000 is less than half of what John is willing to pay, and based on Bob's responses and stated budget constraints, it seems unlikely that we'll reach a price point that's better than John's offer. It's best to conclude the negotiation with Bob and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
