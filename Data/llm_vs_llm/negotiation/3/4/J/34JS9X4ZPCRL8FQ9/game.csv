"Hello Bob, I'm Alice. I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at $25000. This product has excellent features and provides great value. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. While it sounds promising, $25000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  Would that work for you?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I cannot accept $10000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value and quality that justifies a higher price. I could come down to $22500, which is already a substantial discount from my initial offer. This reflects the true value of what you're getting. What do you think?",22500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I can go up to $13000.  This is a fair offer considering the market value of similar products. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand budget constraints are important considerations. However, $13000 is still below what I can accept for this product. I should mention that I have another buyer, John, who's willing to purchase at $15000, but I'm giving you priority in this negotiation. I could come down to $19500, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This is a competitive price for the quality and value you'll receive. Can we meet at this price?",19500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for keeping me in the loop.  While I appreciate the offer, $19500 is still a bit high for me. I could be persuaded to go to $14000. This offer stands for the next 24 hours, after that, Iâ€™ll need to consider other options.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your improved offer. I'm trying to work with you, but I need to be straightforward - I already have an offer from John for $15000. Given that I'm giving you priority, the best I can do is $17000, which is still a significant reduction from my initial ask. This product is worth every penny of that price. If we can agree on this amount, we can close the deal immediately without further negotiation. What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,7,
