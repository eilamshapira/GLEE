Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. While it sounds promising, $25000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I cannot accept $10,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value and quality that justifies a higher price. I could come down to $22,500, which is already a substantial discount from my initial offer. This reflects the true value of what you're getting. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand budget constraints are important considerations. However, $13,000 is still below what I can accept for this product. I should mention that I have another buyer, John, who's willing to purchase at $15,000, but I'm giving you priority in this negotiation.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your improved offer. I'm trying to work with you, but I need to be straightforward - I already have an offer from John for $15,000. Given that I'm giving you priority, the best I can do is $17,000, which is still a significant reduction from my initial ask. This product is worth every penny of that price. If we can agree on this amount, we can close the deal immediately without further negotiation. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
