"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $100
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John at $120

Alice's offer ($100) is better than John's price ($120), saving me $20. Since the product is worth up to $120 for me, and Alice's offer is below this maximum value, it's a reasonable deal. While the product is worth $80 to Alice, getting it for $100 is still better than paying $120 to John.
