"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer of $18,000 is higher than John's price of $15,000, it wouldn't make sense to accept it. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price. If we can't reach a deal below $15,000, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 12000}

I'll offer $12,000 to Alice. This is significantly below John's price of $15,000, which gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to John's offer. If Alice rejects this and counters with a price above $15,000, I can always go with John's offer instead."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's new offer of $17,000 is still above John's price of $15,000, and Alice hasn't shown much willingness to negotiate down to a price below $15,000 (only reducing from $18,000 to $17,000), it makes the most sense to take John's offer at $15,000. This will save me $2,000 compared to Alice's current offer."
