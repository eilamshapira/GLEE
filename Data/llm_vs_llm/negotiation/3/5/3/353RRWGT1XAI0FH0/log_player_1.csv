Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer Bob for my product. I know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and it's worth at least $8,000 to me. If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell it to John for $8,000.

I want to maximize my earnings, but if I ask for too much, Bob might reject my offer. Since Bob values the item at $12,000, I should offer a price that gives him some incentive to accept while still being significantly better than my fallback option of $8,000.

I'll offer the product at $10,000. This gives Bob a $2,000 surplus value ($12,000 - $10,000) while giving me $2,000 more than my alternative option.
