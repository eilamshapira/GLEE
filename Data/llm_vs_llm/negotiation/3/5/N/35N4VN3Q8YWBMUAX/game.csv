"Hi Alice, while I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, the price you're asking is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it. Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I must point out that $800000 is significantly below the product's market value. I have other interested buyers willing to pay substantially more. However, I'm willing to work with you and can reduce my initial asking price. I can offer the product for $1900000, which represents a $400000 reduction from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential return on investment. Would you consider this revised offer?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $1900000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering my constraints. Please let me know if this is something we can work with.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate that you've increased your offer, showing your genuine interest. However, I need to be transparent - I have a standing offer of $1500000 from another buyer. Given this reality, I can't accept anything below that amount. However, I still prefer to work with you, so I'm willing to come down significantly from my last offer. I can offer you the product for $1650000. This is much closer to what you might find reasonable, and it represents excellent value given the product's worth. Would you consider this offer?",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1650000 is still beyond what I'm prepared to spend. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is the maximum I can afford. If this works for you, we can close the deal at this price. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
