"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,300,000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 2300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, the price you're asking is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and since I have John's guaranteed offer at $1,500,000, I cannot accept such a low price. However, I'll continue negotiating with Bob to try to reach a better deal before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I must point out that $800,000 is significantly below the product's market value. I have other interested buyers willing to pay substantially more. However, I'm willing to work with you and can reduce my initial asking price. I can offer the product for $1,900,000, which represents a $400,000 reduction from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential return on investment. Would you consider this revised offer?"", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $1900000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering my constraints. Please let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll continue negotiating. Bob's offer of $900,000 is still well below John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000, so accepting it would be a poor business decision. However, the fact that Bob increased his offer shows he has some flexibility in his budget, so I'll make another counteroffer to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate that you've increased your offer, showing your genuine interest. However, I need to be transparent - I have a standing offer of $1,500,000 from another buyer. Given this reality, I can't accept anything below that amount. However, I still prefer to work with you, so I'm willing to come down significantly from my last offer. I can offer you the product for $1,650,000. This is much closer to what you might find reasonable, and it represents excellent value given the product's worth. Would you consider this offer?"", ""product_price"": 1650000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1650000 is still beyond what I'm prepared to spend. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is the maximum I can afford. If this works for you, we can close the deal at this price. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Given that we're now in round 6 out of 10, and Bob's latest offer of $1,000,000 is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000, it's best to conclude the negotiation with Bob. Despite Bob showing some flexibility by increasing his offers, the gap between his maximum budget ($1,000,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) is too large to bridge. Therefore, I'll take the guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price for the product."
