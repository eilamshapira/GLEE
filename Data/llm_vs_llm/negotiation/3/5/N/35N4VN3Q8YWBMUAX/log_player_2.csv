Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I must point out that $800000 is significantly below the product's market value. I have other interested buyers willing to pay substantially more. However, I'm willing to work with you and can reduce my initial asking price. I can offer the product for $1900000, which represents a $400000 reduction from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential return on investment. Would you consider this revised offer?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate that you've increased your offer, showing your genuine interest. However, I need to be transparent - I have a standing offer of $1500000 from another buyer. Given this reality, I can't accept anything below that amount. However, I still prefer to work with you, so I'm willing to come down significantly from my last offer. I can offer you the product for $1650000. This is much closer to what you might find reasonable, and it represents excellent value given the product's worth. Would you consider this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000.
