Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value and quality of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $400000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000
