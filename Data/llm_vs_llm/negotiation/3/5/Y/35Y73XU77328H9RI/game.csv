"Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I've done some research and believe the product's value is lower than your asking price. I'm willing to make a serious offer to purchase the product for $800000. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you've done your research, but I need to clarify that this product has exceptional value that may not be immediately apparent from external research. While I appreciate your interest and am willing to negotiate from my initial price, $800000 is actually my absolute minimum threshold based on the product's costs and inherent value. I can reduce my asking price to $1050000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of what you'll be receiving. I look forward to your response.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and the discount you've offered. However, I still believe the price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Considering your statement that $800000 is your minimum threshold, I'm willing to meet you halfway between that and your current offer. I'd like to propose a price of $925000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",925000.0,Bob,4,
