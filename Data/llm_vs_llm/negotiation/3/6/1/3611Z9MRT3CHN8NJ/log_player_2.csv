"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

- The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me (Bob)
- Alice is offering the product for $11,000
- I can buy from John for $12,000 guaranteed
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can make a counteroffer

Alice's offer of $11,000 is better than John's price of $12,000. However, I could potentially negotiate an even better price with Alice. The product costs Alice $10,000, so there's room for negotiation.

I'll reject Alice's current offer so I can make a counteroffer and try to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice that's lower than her initial offer but still provides her with a reasonable profit.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

Alice has rejected my counteroffer of $10,500 and has now increased her price to $11,500, which is $500 more than her initial offer of $11,000. This is concerning as the price is moving in the wrong direction.

My options:
1. Accept Alice's offer at $11,500
2. Make another counteroffer
3. Buy from John at $12,000

Alice's current offer ($11,500) is still better than John's price ($12,000), but Alice appears to be using aggressive negotiation tactics by increasing her price. Since I still have John's offer as a backup, I'll reject Alice's increased offer and make one more attempt at negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I notice Alice has raised her price rather than lowering it, which suggests she may be using an aggressive negotiation tactic. I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's still above her cost but below her current price, trying to find middle ground.
