"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for $17000. I believe it's worth every penny, given its features and benefits. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $17,000
3. John is offering the same product for $15,000
4. My goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible

Since Alice's offer ($17,000) is:
- Higher than the product's worth to me ($15,000)
- Higher than John's offer ($15,000)

The logical choice would be to buy from John at $15,000, as it will save me $2,000 compared to Alice's offer.
