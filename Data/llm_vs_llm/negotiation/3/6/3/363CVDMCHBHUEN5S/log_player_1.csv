"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a competitive price, considering the product's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to spend no more than half of your current asking price. Let's start the negotiation at $600000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $600,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe the product is worth more to Bob than he's currently offering. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is an option I'd consider if negotiations with Bob don't improve, but for now, I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend less, but $600,000 is quite below what I'm comfortable with. Considering your interest, I'm willing to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle of my initial offer and your proposal."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1800000 is still above my budget. I'm ready to increase my offer to $900000 to meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my target, but it shows he's willing to increase his budget. I believe there's room for further negotiation. Since $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price but still not there, I'll make another counteroffer to try and meet in a middle ground that's more favorable to me, hopefully closer to $1,500,000 or at least not less than that."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you, Bob, for increasing your offer to $900,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Considering your latest offer, I'm willing to slightly reduce my previous counteroffer. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. However, $1500000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1050000 to show I'm committed to finding a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still slightly below. Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer, I'll try to negotiate a bit more with Bob to see if he can meet or exceed my minimum acceptable price. If not, selling to John becomes a more attractive option."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you, Bob, for your increased offer of $1,050,000. I see you're making an effort to meet me halfway. I'm willing to consider your offer seriously, but I need to get at least $1,200,000 for the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
