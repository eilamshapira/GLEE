"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a competitive price, considering the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000

(Let's start with a lower counteroffer and see how Alice responds. Since the product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, I'll begin with a counteroffer of $600,000.)

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend less, but $600000 is quite below what I'm comfortable with. Considering your interest, I'm willing to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle of my initial offer and your proposal.

# Alice's message: Thank you, Bob, for increasing your offer to $900000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you, Bob, for your increased offer of $1050000. I see you're making an effort to meet me halfway. I'm willing to consider your offer seriously, but I need to get at least $1200000 for the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.
