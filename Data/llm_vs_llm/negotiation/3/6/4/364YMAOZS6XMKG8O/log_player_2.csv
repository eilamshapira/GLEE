"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a great product that you might be interested in. I can offer it to you for $120. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- The product is worth at most $100 to me (Bob)
- Alice is offering the product for $120
- John is willing to sell me the same product for $100

Since Alice's offer ($120) exceeds both the product's value to me ($100) and John's alternative price ($100), the rational choice is to decline Alice's offer and purchase from John instead.
