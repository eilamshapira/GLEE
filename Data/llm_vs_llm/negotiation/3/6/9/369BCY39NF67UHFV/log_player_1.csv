"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $20,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $12000 for the product considering its value to me. Could we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

The reason I choose to sell to John is that Bob has already revealed that $12,000 is his maximum budget, which is exactly the same as John's offer. Since Bob is unlikely to go higher than $12,000 (his stated maximum), and further negotiation rounds would just waste time, it's best to take John's guaranteed offer now. This ensures I get my minimum acceptable price without the risk of losing both buyers or spending more time negotiating."
