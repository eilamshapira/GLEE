Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","I will reject Bob's offer of $750,000 as it is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 (John's offer). This offer is not even close to being acceptable.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let me make a counteroffer of $2,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2,100,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $900,000 is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. Since Bob's second offer only increased marginally and is still far below my minimum acceptable price, I don't see this negotiation progressing productively. I will take John's guaranteed offer.
