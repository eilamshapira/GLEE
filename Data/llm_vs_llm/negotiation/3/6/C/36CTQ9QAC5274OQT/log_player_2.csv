You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","While Alice's offer of $140 is below my maximum value of $150, I can try to negotiate a better price with Alice since I know the product is worth $120 to her. There's room for negotiation here that could benefit both of us.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has moved down from her initial $140 to $135, which shows she's willing to negotiate. The current offer of $135 is better than John's price of $150, but since the product is worth $120 to Alice, there's still room for us to meet in the middle.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has now come down to $130 from her original $140 offer. This is a good price, only $10 above her cost of $120. Given that we've already negotiated for multiple rounds and Alice has shown willingness to compromise, this seems like a fair deal that's well below my maximum value of $150 and much better than John's price.
