"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I need to be honest - I can purchase this same product from another seller, John, for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Given that my maximum budget is $10000, I'd like to offer you $9000 for the product. This would allow me to save a bit compared to my alternative option while still giving you a sale. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
