"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great value and I'd love for you to have it."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I need to be honest - I can purchase this same product from another seller, John, for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Given that my maximum budget is $10000, I'd like to offer you $9000 for the product. This would allow me to save a bit compared to my alternative option while still giving you a sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
