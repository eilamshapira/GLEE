"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you my product for $12000. I believe it's a great value and I'd love for you to have it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's offer of $12,000 is higher than the product's worth to me ($10,000) and is equal to what the product is worth to Alice. I can get the same product from John for $10,000, which is a better deal than Alice's current offer. Since Alice's initial offer doesn't provide any savings compared to my alternative option, I'll reject it and make a counteroffer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I need to be honest - I can purchase this same product from another seller, John, for $10,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Given that my maximum budget is $10,000, I'd like to offer you $9,000 for the product. This would allow me to save a bit compared to my alternative option while still giving you a sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
