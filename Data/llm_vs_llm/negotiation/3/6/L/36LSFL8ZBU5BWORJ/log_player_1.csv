Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me and also lower than what I know Bob is willing to pay ($800,000), and considering I have the option to sell it to John for $1,000,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I will also not sell it to John just yet, as there's a possibility I can negotiate a better price with Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Considering Bob's offer was $600,000 and knowing he values the product at $800,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is still below my initial offer but takes into account Bob's valuation and tries to meet him halfway.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $700,000 is closer to his valuation of $800,000, but it's still below what I'm willing to accept, especially since I have the option to sell it to John for $1,000,000. However, I'm getting closer to a potential deal with Bob, and his latest offer shows he's willing to negotiate upwards.

Given that Bob's offer is now $700,000 and I previously offered $1,000,000, I'll try to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me but still considers Bob's latest move.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Considering Bob's latest offer of $700,000 and my previous offer of $1,000,000, I'll make a counteroffer that slightly reduces my price to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still aims to get as close as possible to my target while being mindful of Bob's valuation.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer has increased to $725,000, which is still below his valuation of $800,000 and significantly below what I can get from John. However, it shows he's continuing to negotiate in good faith and move closer to a potential agreement.

Given that we're halfway through the negotiation rounds and Bob's latest offer, I'll consider making a more significant concession to try and close the deal, but I must weigh this against the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Considering Bob's latest offer of $725,000 and knowing he values the product at $800,000, I'll make a counteroffer that brings my price down further but still aims to maximize my earnings. Since Bob is getting closer to his valuation, I expect him to be more willing to meet me at a higher price.
