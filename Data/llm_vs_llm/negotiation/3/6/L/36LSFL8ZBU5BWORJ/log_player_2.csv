"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice's offer is way above your budget and your maximum price. It makes sense to negotiate down or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

This is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but still gives room to negotiate upwards while staying well below my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While Alice came down to her minimum, it's still above my absolute limit. I need to signal I'm serious but won't go that high.  It's worth negotiating a bit more to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

This offer shows I'm willing to move closer to Alice's minimum, but not without a significant discount. It's a strong signal that I'm serious about buying but need a more reasonable price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice is slowly coming down, but the price is still too high. I'll counteroffer again, staying firm below my $800,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 725000
}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still staying well below her price. This keeps the pressure on Alice while signaling I'm serious about the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

Alice is getting closer, but it's not worth the risk of going over budget. John's guaranteed offer is a safer bet at this point."
