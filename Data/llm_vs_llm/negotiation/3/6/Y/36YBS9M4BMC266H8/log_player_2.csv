"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that has significant value. Based on its features and market demand, I'm offering it to you for $3500000. This product represents a substantial investment opportunity with potential for considerable returns. While I understand this is a significant price point, I believe the value proposition justifies it. I have another interested buyer, John, who is prepared to purchase, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since the offer from Alice is $3,500,000, which is significantly higher than the maximum value of $1,200,000 that the product is worth to me, I will reject Alice's offer. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which aligns with my budget.
