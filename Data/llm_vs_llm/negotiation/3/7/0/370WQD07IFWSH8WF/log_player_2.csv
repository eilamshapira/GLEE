"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Based on the information provided, I need to analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $1,650,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: $1,500,000

The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me. Alice's offer exceeds this value by $150,000. John is willing to sell the same product for exactly $1,500,000.

My goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible. In this case, buying from John for $1,500,000 would save me $150,000 compared to Alice's offer.
