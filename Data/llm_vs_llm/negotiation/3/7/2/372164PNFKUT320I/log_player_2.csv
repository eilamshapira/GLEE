Starting with a low offer tests Alice's willingness to negotiate. It's a common tactic in this kind of negotiation."

Alice is getting closer, but it's still worthwhile to counteroffer.  We're getting into a range where a bit more negotiation could save you a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 9500

This offer splits the difference between her last offer and our last counteroffer. It shows a willingness to compromise but also sets a firm boundary within the budget."

This is getting close to John's price. Let's try one more time to see if we can get a bit closer to our ideal outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 10000

This matches John's price.  It's unlikely Alice will go this low, but it's worth a shot before taking John's offer."
