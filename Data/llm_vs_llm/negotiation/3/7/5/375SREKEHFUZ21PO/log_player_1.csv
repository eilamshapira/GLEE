Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my price to maximize my earnings. 

The product is worth $150 to Bob, so that's his maximum willingness to pay. If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell to John for $80, which represents my minimum acceptable price.

Since Bob knows the product is worth $150 to him, I should offer a price that gives Bob some incentive to accept while still capturing most of the value for myself. If I price too close to $150, Bob might reject it. A price point that allows Bob to feel he's getting some value while maximizing my profit would be reasonable.
