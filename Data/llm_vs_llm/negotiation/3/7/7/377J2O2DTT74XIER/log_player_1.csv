"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm confident you'll love it. I'm offering it to you for the price of..."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can find similar products in the market for much less. I would be willing to offer $8000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a tough spot. Bob's offer is far below my minimum value. However, I can't accept this, I'll lose money. I also don't want to immediately sell to John as I think I can get more money from Bob.

My decision: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position, but $8,000 is too low for this product. Considering its unique features and value, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about..."", ""product_price"": 21000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $21000 is still well above what I can justify spending. Given market conditions and comparable products, I can increase my offer to $10000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while being competitive with other options in the market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Again, Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I need. It's getting frustrating, but I still think I can get more from Bob. Selling to John right now is tempting, but I'll try one more time.

My decision: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, here's my next offer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not able to go that low. However, I want to make this work. How about... "", ""product_price"": 18000}"
