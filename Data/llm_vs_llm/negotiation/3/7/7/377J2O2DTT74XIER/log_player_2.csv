"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm confident you'll love it. I'm offering it to you for the price of... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Given that my maximum value for the product is $12,000 and John is willing to sell it at that price, I would definitely not accept Alice's offer of $25,000, which is more than twice my maximum value. I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I always have the option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can find similar products in the market for much less. I would be willing to offer $8,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 8000}

I'm starting with a low but reasonable offer at $8,000, which gives me room to negotiate upward if needed while still staying well below my maximum of $12,000. This also leaves me the option to buy from John at $12,000 if Alice isn't willing to negotiate to a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position, but $8000 is too low for this product. Considering its unique features and value, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $21,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $21,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $21,000 is still significantly above my maximum value of $12,000. While she did reduce the price, the reduction isn't substantial enough to make it attractive, especially considering I can buy from John for $12,000. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, but if Alice doesn't come down significantly in price, I'll have to consider buying from John instead."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $21,000 is still well above what I can justify spending. Given market conditions and comparable products, I can increase my offer to $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while being competitive with other options in the market."", ""product_price"": 10000}

I'm increasing my offer by $2,000 to show good faith in negotiating, but still keeping it below my maximum value of $12,000. If Alice doesn't come down significantly in the next round, I might need to seriously consider taking John's offer at $12,000 rather than continuing prolonged negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not able to go that low. However, I want to make this work. How about...  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'm choosing to buy from John for $12,000. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer of $18,000 is still $6,000 higher than John's price
2. While Alice is gradually reducing her price, the decrements are small (from $25k → $21k → $18k)
3. Even if negotiations continue, it's unlikely Alice will go below $12,000 given her current pace of price reduction
4. I know the product is only worth $12,000 to me, so there's no reason to pay more
5. We've already spent 5 rounds negotiating, and time is also valuable

It makes the most economic sense to take John's guaranteed offer of $12,000 rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to result in a better deal."
