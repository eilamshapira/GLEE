,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $90 for it.",90.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. However, $90 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $110 for you, as I believe this product is truly valuable. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I really think this product is worth the investment. How about we settle at $105? It's a fair price and a good compromise.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $105 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to get it a bit lower.  Would you be willing to do $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, $95 is still below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle at $102.50. It's a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. How about we settle at $102? It's just a bit lower than my last offer and should be within your budget.",102.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks again for your flexibility.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  Would you do $98?",98.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle. However, $98 is still below what I can accept. Let's try $101. It's very close to your last offer and still within a reasonable range for both of us.",101.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, we're so close to reaching an agreement. How about we settle at $100.50? It's a small step down from my last offer and should be acceptable for both of us.",100.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $100.50 is still a bit too high for me. This is my final offer, take it or leave it: $98.  I think that's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that amount.",98.0,Bob,8,
"Hi Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but $98 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $100, which is a fair price and meets my bottom line. Let me know if you can accept this.",100.0,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I really want to make this work for both of us. My final offer is $100. It's the lowest I can go while still meeting my needs. Let me know if you can accept this.",100.0,Alice,9,
