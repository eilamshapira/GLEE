"Hi Alice, while I appreciate the quality of the product, the price of $25000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $6000 for it. Let me know if this works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest and counteroffer. I understand budget considerations are important, but $6000 is significantly below the product's value. Given the quality and features of this product, I cannot go below $20000. This is already a reduction from my initial offer and represents good value. If your budget is limited, I might be able to negotiate further, but I need to stay much closer to my asking price.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $20000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7000, which is the highest I can go while staying within my financial limits. Please let me know if this is something we can work with.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but $7000 is still well below what this product is worth. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. My lowest possible offer would be $16500. This is significantly reduced from my initial price and represents my absolute minimum considering I have another buyer willing to pay $15000. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16500 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm prepared to offer $7500 as my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. Let me know your thoughts.",7500.0,Bob,6,
