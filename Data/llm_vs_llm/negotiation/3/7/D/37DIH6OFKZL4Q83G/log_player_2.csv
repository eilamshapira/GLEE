Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest and counteroffer. I understand budget considerations are important, but $6000 is significantly below the product's value. Given the quality and features of this product, I cannot go below $20000. This is already a reduction from my initial offer and represents good value. If your budget is limited, I might be able to negotiate further, but I need to stay much closer to my asking price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but $7000 is still well below what this product is worth. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. My lowest possible offer would be $16500. This is significantly reduced from my initial price and represents my absolute minimum considering I have another buyer willing to pay $15000. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.
