"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Given that Alice's offer is $1,500,000 and John is also willing to sell the product for $1,500,000, there is no financial advantage to accepting Alice's offer. Since the goal is to save as much money as possible and there is no benefit to accepting Alice's offer over John's, the decision is to buy from John.
