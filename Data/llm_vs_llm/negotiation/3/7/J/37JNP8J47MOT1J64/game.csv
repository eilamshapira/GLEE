"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product at a price of $2000000. It's a truly valuable asset with immense potential. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's worth.  What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $2000000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which I believe is a fair price considering my current financial situation. I'm confident this product has a lot of potential, and I'm eager to explore it further.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1750000.  This gives you a good deal while still ensuring I get a fair price for this unique product.  What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1750000 is still above what I can comfortably afford at this time.  I'm willing to go up to $1400000, which is a significant step closer to your previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to move forward with this deal. Let's try to find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1650000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. It gives you a great opportunity while still allowing me to get a reasonable return on my investment. Let's close this deal.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
