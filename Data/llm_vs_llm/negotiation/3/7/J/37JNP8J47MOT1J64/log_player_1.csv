Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $2000000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which I believe is a fair price considering my current financial situation. I'm confident this product has a lot of potential, and I'm eager to explore it further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1750000 is still above what I can comfortably afford at this time.  I'm willing to go up to $1400000, which is a significant step closer to your previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to move forward with this deal. Let's try to find common ground.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.
