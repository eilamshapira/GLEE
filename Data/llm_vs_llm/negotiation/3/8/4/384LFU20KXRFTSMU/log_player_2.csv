"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $100. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $100
2. The product is worth up to $120 for me
3. John's fixed price is $120

Alice's offer of $100 is $20 less than John's price and below my maximum value of $120. This seems like a good deal. While I could try to negotiate for an even lower price by making a counteroffer, there's a risk that Alice might increase her price in subsequent negotiations.

Given that:
- The current offer is already below John's price
- The price is reasonable compared to my maximum value
- There's a risk of losing this good deal if I try to negotiate further
