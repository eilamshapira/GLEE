"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be an excellent investment for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1300000. This price reflects the product's true worth while still leaving room for you to generate significant value.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1300000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to offer $1000000. This price is fair and allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $1000000 is lower than what this product commands in the market. Given its value and potential return on investment for you, I can adjust my price to $1175000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true worth.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1175000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
