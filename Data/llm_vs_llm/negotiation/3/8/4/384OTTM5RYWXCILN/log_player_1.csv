Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be an excellent investment for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,300,000. This price reflects the product's true worth while still leaving room for you to generate significant value."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1300000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to offer $1000000. This price is fair and allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $1,000,000 is still significantly below the potential value I can get. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, there's room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round that's more reasonable for both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $1,000,000 is lower than what this product commands in the market. Given its value and potential return on investment for you, I can adjust my price to $1,175,000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 1175000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1175000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,100,000. This is a reasonable compromise that provides good value for both parties. The price is significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and while it's less than my initial target, it represents a fair deal that avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially breaking down. The $1,100,000 offer provides a solid profit margin while ensuring we close the deal."
