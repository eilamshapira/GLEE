"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be an excellent investment for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1300000. This price reflects the product's true worth while still leaving room for you to generate significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above what the product is worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation.
* **Counteroffering is a better strategy.**  By rejecting the initial offer, I can make a counteroffer that aligns more closely with the product's value to Alice. This could lead to a better price for me."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $1000000 is lower than what this product commands in the market. Given its value and potential return on investment for you, I can adjust my price to $1175000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above the product's value to her ($800,000) and significantly higher than my counteroffer.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Alice is willing to negotiate, so I can counter again to find a price that works for both of us."
