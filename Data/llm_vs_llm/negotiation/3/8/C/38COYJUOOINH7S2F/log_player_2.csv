"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly below its worth to you. I understand this might be a large investment, but I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below her valuation, it's still higher than your maximum price and what John offers. You can do better by rejecting this offer."
