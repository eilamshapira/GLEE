"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $70 for the product. What do you think?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $70 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90 for the product. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal. Let me know if you're interested.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down to $90, Alice. I understand it's a good deal for you, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about we settle at $75? This way, you still make a profit, and I can afford the product.",75.0,Bob,4,
