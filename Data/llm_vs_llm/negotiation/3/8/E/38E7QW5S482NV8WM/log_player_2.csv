"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to make a decision that maximizes my outcome based on the information provided.

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me according to the scenario.

Alice is offering to sell it for $850,000, which exceeds what the product is worth to me.

John is offering to sell the same product for $800,000, which is exactly what the product is worth to me.

Since Alice's offer is higher than John's price and higher than what the product is worth to me, the rational choice is to buy from John instead.
