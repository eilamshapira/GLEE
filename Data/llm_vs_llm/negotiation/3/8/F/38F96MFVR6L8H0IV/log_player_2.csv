"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe could be beneficial for you. I'm offering it at $1200000, which is a fair market value based on its worth. I already have another interested buyer, John, who is prepared to purchase it at this price, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me (my maximum valuation)
- Alice is offering to sell it for $1,200,000
- John is willing to sell the same product to me for $1,000,000
- My goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible

Given that Alice's price ($1,200,000) exceeds both my valuation and John's offering price, the rational decision is to buy from John instead.
