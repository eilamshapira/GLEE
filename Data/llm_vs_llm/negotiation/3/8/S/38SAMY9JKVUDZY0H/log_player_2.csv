"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a incredible offer for you. I'm selling a highly valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. The price is $2000000. This is a rare opportunity to own something truly special. If you're interested, please let me know at your earliest convenience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your alternative option of buying from John for $1,500,000. There's no reason to accept an offer this high. You should reject and see if Alice will come down to a more reasonable price."
