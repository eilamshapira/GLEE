,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm genuinely interested in the product, but I'm only comfortable paying $12000 at this point.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $12000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad we can continue negotiating. While $12000 is a step in the right direction, I still believe the product's value lies higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's discuss the product at $16000.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $14000. Let's see if we can bridge that gap.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $14000. I'm glad to see you're still interested in the product and willing to negotiate. Considering your latest offer, I'm willing to make a concession. I'll meet you in the middle between my last offer of $16000 and your offer of $14000. Let's discuss the product at $15000.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility, but $15000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really trying to stick to my budget, so my final offer is $13500.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13500 is your final offer, and I appreciate your transparency. Given that we're close, I'm willing to make a significant concession to try and finalize the deal. I'll lower my price to $14250, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.",14250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant at $14250, but I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14000.  I'm hoping we can agree on this and finalize the deal.",14000.0,Bob,8,
