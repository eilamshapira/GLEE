Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm genuinely interested in the product, but I'm only comfortable paying $12000 at this point.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $12,000 because it's still lower than what I'm aiming for, and I believe the product is worth more. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. In the next round, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $12,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad we can continue negotiating.

Let's discuss the product at $16,000."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $14000. Let's see if we can bridge that gap.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $14,000 because, although it's getting closer to my target, I still believe I can get a better price. Bob has shown willingness to increase his offer, so I think there's room for further negotiation. In the next round, I'll send another counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $14,000. I'm glad to see you're still interested in the product and willing to negotiate.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility, but $15000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really trying to stick to my budget, so my final offer is $13500.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $13,500 because, although it's his final offer, I still believe the product is worth more. Since Bob has stated this is his final offer, I'll consider making a significant concession in the next round to try and close the deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,500 just yet. In the next round, I'll send another counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that $13,500 is your final offer, and I appreciate your transparency. Given that we're close, I'm willing to make a significant concession to try and finalize the deal. I'll lower my price to $14,250, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 14250}"

Round 8
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $14,000. At this point, we've negotiated extensively, and Bob has shown a willingness to meet me at a price that's close to my target. Given that we're running out of rounds and I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, accepting $14,000 seems like the best choice to ensure a sale at a reasonable price. It's a compromise, but it's a better outcome than potentially selling for less or not selling at all."
