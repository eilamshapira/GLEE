"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $500000. I believe this is a fair price for the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest. However, $500000 is significantly below my valuation. I can offer you the product for $1800000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for its value. Let me know your thoughts!",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for reconsidering the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1800000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $750000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer of $750000, I still can't accept it as it's below my minimum valuation. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer you the product for $1500000. I believe this price reflects its true value. Looking forward to your response!",1500000.0,Alice,5,
