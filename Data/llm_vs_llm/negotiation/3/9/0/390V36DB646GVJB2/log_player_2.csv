"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and I can buy it from John for the same price, I'll start by making a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest. However, $500000 is significantly below my valuation. I can offer you the product for $1800000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for its value. Let me know your thoughts!

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to meet Alice halfway between my previous offer and her new offer. However, since I know I can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, I won't go too high.

{""message"": ""Thank you for reconsidering the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer of $750000, I still can't accept it as it's below my minimum valuation. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer you the product for $1500000. I believe this price reflects its true value. Looking forward to your response!
