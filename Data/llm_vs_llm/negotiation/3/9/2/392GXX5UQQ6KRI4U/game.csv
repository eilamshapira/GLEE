"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $75 doesn't meet my minimum required price. Let's try to work something out; I'll send you a counteroffer in the next round.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand the need to work within a budget, but this product has significant value. My next counteroffer is $125. Let me know if youâ€™re comfortable with that price.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $125 is still a bit much for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe the product's value warrants a slightly higher price. Would you consider $110?",,Alice,4,RejectOffer

"Alice, I'm willing to go up slightly, but $110 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Would you consider $105?",105.0,Bob,6,
