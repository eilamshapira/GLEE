"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This initial offer of $3,000,000 is way too high, as it's more than double my maximum value of $1,200,000. It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer when I can buy from John for $1,200,000. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $800,000. This is significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000, which gives me room to negotiate upward if needed. Since Alice started very high at $3,000,000, I'm starting relatively low to hopefully meet somewhere in the middle, but still below my maximum acceptable price of $1,200,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $2,500,000 is still more than twice my maximum value of $1,200,000. While she did reduce the price from her initial offer, the reduction isn't significant enough to make it attractive, especially when I can still buy from John for $1,200,000. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, trying to reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 950000}

I'll increase my offer to $950,000. This is a reasonable step up from my previous offer of $800,000, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeping well below John's price of $1,200,000. This gives me room to continue negotiating while maintaining a potential cost savings compared to buying from John. Alice has shown some willingness to reduce her price, so I'm hoping this increase in my offer will encourage further negotiation toward a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is still significantly above my maximum value of $1,200,000, and it's also well above John's guaranteed price. While Alice continues to lower her price (from $3M to $2.5M to $2M), she's still far from a competitive price. Since we're only in round 5 of 10, I'll reject and make another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to a reasonable price. If we can't make substantial progress in the next few rounds, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'll increase my offer to $1,100,000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer of $950,000, showing I'm willing to make substantial moves toward reaching a deal. This price is still below John's price of $1,200,000, which would give me some savings, but it's also much closer to what might be acceptable to Alice given that she's been steadily lowering her price. This offer signals that I'm serious about making a deal while still maintaining some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($1,750,000) is still significantly above John's price ($1,200,000)
2. While Alice has been lowering her price (from $3M to $2.5M to $2M to $1.75M), the rate of decrease suggests we're unlikely to get below John's price in the remaining rounds
3. Even if Alice were to continue reducing her price at the same rate, we might not reach a price below $1,200,000 before the 10 rounds are up
4. Since my maximum value for the product is $1,200,000, John's price is already at my maximum acceptable level

Therefore, it's most rational to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 rather than risk further negotiations that may not result in a better deal."
