"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a figure closer to $600000. I believe this price point would align better with my budget and the value I can generate with the product. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600000 is significantly below my minimum expectation.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $750000. This still leaves me with a fair profit, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product at this price. ",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $650000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $700000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to compromise.",700000.0,Alice,5,
