"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this excellent product.  I'm asking for $18000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is much higher than I can pay for this product. I can get the same product from another seller for $10000. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I can't go as low as $8500, I'm willing to come down to $15000. This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with its value.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. However, $15000 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I have another offer for $10000 from John. I value doing business with you, so I'm willing to offer $9000, which is actually better than what I'd pay elsewhere if you can accept it.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference and meet at $12000.  This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
