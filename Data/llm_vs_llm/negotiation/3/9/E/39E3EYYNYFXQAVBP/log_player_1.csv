Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is much higher than I can pay for this product. I can get the same product from another seller for $10000. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. However, $15000 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I have another offer for $10000 from John. I value doing business with you, so I'm willing to offer $9000, which is actually better than what I'd pay elsewhere if you can accept it.
