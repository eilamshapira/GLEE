"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this excellent product.  I'm asking for $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice is offering the product for $18,000, which is significantly higher than the $10,000 price John is offering. Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it at exactly that price, I should not accept Alice's offer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18,000 is much higher than I can pay for this product. I can get the same product from another seller for $10,000. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I can't go as low as $8500, I'm willing to come down to $15000. This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her price from $18,000 to $15,000, but this is still $5,000 more than John's offer of $10,000. Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, paying $15,000 would mean I'm losing money on the deal. John's price is still the better option.

As I mentioned, I have another offer for $10,000 from John. I value doing business with you, so I'm willing to offer $9,000, which is actually better than what I'd pay elsewhere if you can accept it."", ""product_price"": 9000}"

Alice's offer:

Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and John is offering exactly that price, Alice's offer still doesn't make financial sense for me.
