Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be candid - your asking price of $1800000 is significantly above what I can justify paying. I have another seller, John, willing to sell me the same product for $1200000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a more reasonable price. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale while allowing me some room below my alternative option. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for coming down in your price, Alice. I appreciate the movement, but $1450000 is still significantly above what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, I have John's offer at $1200000 as a guaranteed option. To make it worth my while to choose you over him, I need a better price. I can offer $1100000, which saves me some money compared to John's offer while still providing you with a solid sale. This is a fair price that works for both of us - you make a sale above my initial offer, and I get some savings compared to my alternative option. Does this work for you?

While I want to find a solution that works for us both, I can't accept such a substantial reduction. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 as my final offer. This price reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your position. If this doesn't work for you, I believe it's best to pursue other opportunities. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate and your reduced offer of $1300000. We're getting closer, but I'm still in a position where John's offer of $1200000 makes more financial sense for me. Since you mentioned this is your final offer, I'd like to be straightforward - I can offer $1150000, which is my best and final offer. This is very close to what I would pay John, but it gives you the sale and me a small savings. If this doesn't work for you, I understand and will need to go with John's offer. I hope we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's clear he's strongly anchored to John's offer of $1,200,000. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap significantly enough to warrant the risk of losing a guaranteed sale."
