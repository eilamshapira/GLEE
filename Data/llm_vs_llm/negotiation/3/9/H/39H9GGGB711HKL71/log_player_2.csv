"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1800000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","The offer from Alice is $1,800,000, which is significantly higher than the maximum value the product is worth to me ($1,200,000) and also higher than John's guaranteed price of $1,200,000.

Since Alice's offer exceeds both the product's value to me and John's alternative price, I should not accept it.

I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be candid - your asking price of $1,800,000 is significantly above what I can justify paying. I have another seller, John, willing to sell me the same product for $1,200,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a more reasonable price. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale while allowing me some room below my alternative option. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to negotiate. I understand your position, however, the product's value is truly significant, and your initial offer is quite a distance from what I can accept.  Would you be willing to consider $1450000? This reflects a considerable compromise on my end while acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for coming down in your price, Alice. I appreciate the movement, but $1,450,000 is still significantly above what makes economic sense for me. As I mentioned, I have John's offer at $1,200,000 as a guaranteed option. To make it worth my while to choose you over him, I need a better price. I can offer $1,100,000, which saves me some money compared to John's offer while still providing you with a solid sale. This is a fair price that works for both of us - you make a sale above my initial offer, and I get some savings compared to my alternative option.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations of this product. While I want to find a solution that works for us both, I can't accept such a substantial reduction. I'm willing to come down to $1300000 as my final offer. This price reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your position. If this doesn't work for you, I believe it's best to pursue other opportunities.

We're getting closer, but I'm still in a position where John's offer of $1,200,000 makes more financial sense for me. Since you mentioned this is your final offer, I'd like to be straightforward - I can offer $1,150,000, which is my best and final offer. This is very close to what I would pay John, but it gives you the sale and me a small savings. If this doesn't work for you, I understand and will need to go with John's offer. I hope we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
