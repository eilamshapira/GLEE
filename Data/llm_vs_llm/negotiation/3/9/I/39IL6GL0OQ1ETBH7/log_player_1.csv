"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I need to make an initial offer to Bob that is higher than my minimum acceptable value of $8,000, while leaving room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer of $9,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While I could try to negotiate for a higher price, this is already a reasonable offer that gives me $1,000 more than my alternative option of selling to John. I'll accept this offer.
