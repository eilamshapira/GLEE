"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an excellent product that I believe will meet your needs. I'm offering it to you at a competitive price before anyone else has the chance to buy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $8,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is significantly above my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $8,000, which matches my maximum value

Since Alice's price ($15,000) is nearly double my maximum value ($8,000), and John offers the product at exactly my maximum value, the logical choice would be to buy from John.
