Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, I will reject his offer.

Also, since selling to John for $150 is a better option than selling to Bob for $100, I will not consider selling to John at this point, but rather try to negotiate a better price with Bob.

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","My counteroffer to Bob is to sell the product for $180.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and also below the alternative option of selling to John for $150, I will reject his offer.

I will also reject the option to sell to John for now, as I still hope to negotiate a better price with Bob.

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and also below the alternative option of selling to John for $150, I will reject his offer.

At this point, I'm not making much progress in the negotiation with Bob, and selling to John for $150 is starting to look like a more attractive option.

However, I'll try one more time to negotiate with Bob. If he's not willing to meet me at a reasonable price, I'll sell to John.

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already made a counteroffer of $155, which is very close to the alternative option of selling to John for $150, I think it's time to stop negotiating with Bob.

Selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed deal, and I don't want to risk going back and forth with Bob anymore.

So, my decision is to sell the product to John.
