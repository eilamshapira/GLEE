"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $180 is way above my maximum value of $80, and significantly higher than John's price. It would be better to reject and make a counteroffer, trying to negotiate a better price with Alice. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I can always buy from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 50}

I'll start with a low counteroffer of $50. Since the product is worth $80 to me, and John is willing to sell it for $80, starting low gives me room to negotiate upward while still potentially getting a better deal than John's price. If Alice rejects this offer, we can try to find a middle ground in subsequent rounds."
