"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $125.  Let me know if you'd like to take it!",125.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $125 is a bit high for me. Given that I can find similar products in the market, I can offer $110 for it. This would still give you a good profit margin. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $115. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",115.0,Alice,3,
