"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $125 is a bit high for me. Given that I can find similar products in the market, I can offer $110 for it. This would still give you a good profit margin. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $115. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
