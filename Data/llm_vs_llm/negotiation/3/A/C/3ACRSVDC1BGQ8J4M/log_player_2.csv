(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both our maximum budget and John's offer.  We should make a counteroffer far lower, aiming to negotiate a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $500,000}

This counter-offer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer but provides us with substantial room for negotiation upwards while staying well below John's backup offer."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer has come down, it's still far above our budget and John's offer. We need to signal that we're serious about a lower price but also show some flexibility. Let's continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $600,000}

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

We're making progress, but $1,300,000 is still too high. We're getting closer to a point where Alice's offer might become more appealing than John's, but we're not there yet.  Let's counteroffer again and see if we can nudge her closer to our range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $700,000}

This counteroffer raises our offer again, showing willingness to negotiate, but also places us just below John's offer as a strategic move.  This puts a degree of pressure on Alice, as accepting a slightly higher offer from us might now be more appealing than risking further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This is getting closer, but it's still a significant amount more than John's offer. We're at a critical point in the negotiation. Let's see if we can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $750,000}

This offer splits the difference between our last offer and Alice's current offer, signaling our willingness to move closer to her price while still aiming for a substantial discount. We're now very close to John's offer, increasing the pressure on Alice to either accept a reasonable price or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice's offer is now lower than John's. While we could try to negotiate further, it's getting risky. Accepting this offer guarantees a purchase below our initial budget and avoids the risk of missing out in the last round."
