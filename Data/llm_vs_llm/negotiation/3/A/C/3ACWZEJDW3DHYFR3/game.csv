"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. Considering my budget and the value I see in the product, I'd be comfortable purchasing it for $90. Let me know if that works for you.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $90. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, that price is lower than what I can accept for this item. The product is of high quality and has substantial market value. I can come down to $125, which still provides you with significant value considering the product is worth $150 to you. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",125.0,Alice,3,
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $125 is still a bit above my ideal range. Would you be willing to settle at $110? That price is closer to what I had in mind and still offers you a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move towards a deal. Since $110 seems a bit low for a swift agreement, how about we meet in the middle at $115? I believe this price respects the product's quality while staying within my budget. Let me know if this works for you.",115.0,Bob,4,
