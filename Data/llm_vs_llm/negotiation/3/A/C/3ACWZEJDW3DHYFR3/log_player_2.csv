Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $90. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, that price is lower than what I can accept for this item. The product is of high quality and has substantial market value. I can come down to $125, which still provides you with significant value considering the product is worth $150 to you. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move towards a deal.
