"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this awesome product! I'm offering it to you for a great price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, I'm not going to accept Bob's offer of $80. That's below my minimum and I still have room to negotiate.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $165 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up a bit, but $120 is my final offer. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, $120 is still not ideal, but it's getting closer. It's a difficult decision... I'm leaning towards rejecting and counter-offering again to see if I can get closer to $150. I can always sell to John in later rounds.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, here's my counteroffer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $155 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $140.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","This is a tough call. $140 is close, but I can still get $150 from John. I've already invested a few rounds in this negotiation...

Considering the remaining rounds, and the potential for further negotiation, I think I'll stick with Bob for one more round. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a final counter offer.
