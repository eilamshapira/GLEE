"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $12000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $15000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle at $13500? This is a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
