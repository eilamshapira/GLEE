"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe you would find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you first at a price of $1500000. I think this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000), it would not be rational to accept her offer. John's offer is already at my maximum valuation, and while it's not ideal, it's much better than Alice's price.
