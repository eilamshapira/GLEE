"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer or go with the alternative of buying from John.

Alice is offering the product for $150, which is exactly the maximum value I'm willing to pay. John is also offering the product for $150.

Since both options cost the same amount ($150), and there's no price advantage in choosing one over the other, I might as well accept Alice's offer since she approached me first.
