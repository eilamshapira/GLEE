"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer is the same as John's price ($1,000,000), there's no advantage in accepting it immediately. By rejecting and making a counteroffer, I can try to negotiate a better price with Alice. If the negotiation doesn't lead to a better price, I can still buy from John for $1,000,000 later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low that it would be considered unreasonable.

{""product_price"": 600000}

This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still represents a substantial amount. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, offering $600,000 allows room for negotiation while potentially leading to a final price that would save me money compared to buying from John."
