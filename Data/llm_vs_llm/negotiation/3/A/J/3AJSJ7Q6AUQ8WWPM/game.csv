"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its exceptional quality and value, I'm starting with a competitive price. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.",250.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, I need to be honest that $250 is far above my budget. The product is actually worth no more than $80 to me, and I can get the same item from another seller at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a reasonable middle ground. Would you consider selling it for $60? This would give me a reason to choose you over the other option.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your honest response. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must admit that $60 is below the product's value to me. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Let's meet in the middle between your proposed price and the product's value to me.",200.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $200 is still well above what I can pay for this product. I should clarify that the product is only worth $80 to me at maximum, and I already have an offer from another seller at exactly that price. If you'd like to make this deal work, I need a price below $80 to justify choosing you over the alternative. My offer is $65. This gives you a sale while giving me some benefit over my other option.",65.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you have an alternative offer at $80, and I appreciate your willingness to give me a chance to make a sale. However, I must reiterate that $65 is still below the product's value to me. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to a fair price. Considering your maximum budget of $80, I'll offer you a price that's slightly above that, but still lower than my previous offers.",180.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I think we may be misunderstanding each other. I cannot and will not pay more than $80 for this product because that's literally the maximum value it has to me. Plus, I already have a guaranteed option to purchase it for exactly $80 from another seller. If I'm going to choose you over them, your price needs to be below $80 to give me any reason to do business with you. My final offer is $70 - this is still a better deal for you than losing the sale entirely, which will happen if we can't agree on a price below $80.",70.0,Bob,6,
