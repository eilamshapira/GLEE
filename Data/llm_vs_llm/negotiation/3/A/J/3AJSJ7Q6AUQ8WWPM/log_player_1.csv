"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its exceptional quality and value, I'm starting with a competitive price. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, I need to be honest that $250 is far above my budget. The product is actually worth no more than $80 to me, and I can get the same item from another seller at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a reasonable middle ground. Would you consider selling it for $60? This would give me a reason to choose you over the other option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

My reasoning is that Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than the minimum value of the product to me, which is $150. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate and try to get a better price. I will make a counteroffer in the next round to try to find a middle ground that is closer to the product's value to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your honest response. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must admit that $60 is below the product's value to me. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Let's meet in the middle between your proposed price and the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $200 is still well above what I can pay for this product. I should clarify that the product is only worth $80 to me at maximum, and I already have an offer from another seller at exactly that price. If you'd like to make this deal work, I need a price below $80 to justify choosing you over the alternative. My offer is $65. This gives you a sale while giving me some benefit over my other option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

My reasoning is that Bob's offer of $65 is still significantly lower than the minimum value of the product to me, which is $150. While Bob has clarified that the product is only worth $80 to him, I am not willing to sell it for such a low price. I will make another counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better price. If the negotiation doesn't improve, I may consider selling the product to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that you have an alternative offer at $80, and I appreciate your willingness to give me a chance to make a sale. However, I must reiterate that $65 is still below the product's value to me. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to a fair price. Considering your maximum budget of $80, I'll offer you a price that's slightly above that, but still lower than my previous offers."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I think we may be misunderstanding each other. I cannot and will not pay more than $80 for this product because that's literally the maximum value it has to me. Plus, I already have a guaranteed option to purchase it for exactly $80 from another seller. If I'm going to choose you over them, your price needs to be below $80 to give me any reason to do business with you. My final offer is $70 - this is still a better deal for you than losing the sale entirely, which will happen if we can't agree on a price below $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

My reasoning is that Bob's offer of $70 is still significantly lower than the minimum value of the product to me, which is $150. Bob has made it clear that he will not pay more than $80, and I have already made several compromises. Given that I have a guaranteed sale option with John for $150, which is much closer to the product's value to me, I decide to end the negotiation with Bob and sell the product to John. This ensures that I get a fair price for the product."
