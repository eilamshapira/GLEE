"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its exceptional quality and value, I'm starting with a competitive price. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given that the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and I can buy it from John for exactly $80, Alice's offer of $250 is way too high.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, I need to be honest that $250 is far above my budget. The product is actually worth no more than $80 to me, and I can get the same item from another seller at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a reasonable middle ground. Would you consider selling it for $60? This would give me a reason to choose you over the other option."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your honest response. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must admit that $60 is below the product's value to me. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Let's meet in the middle between your proposed price and the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $200 is still well above the maximum value of $80 that the product is worth to me, and it's significantly higher than John's fixed price of $80. There's no reason for me to pay $200 when I can get the same product for $80.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $200 is still well above what I can pay for this product. I should clarify that the product is only worth $80 to me at maximum, and I already have an offer from another seller at exactly that price. If you'd like to make this deal work, I need a price below $80 to justify choosing you over the alternative. My offer is $65. This gives you a sale while giving me some benefit over my other option."", ""product_price"": 65}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you have an alternative offer at $80, and I appreciate your willingness to give me a chance to make a sale. However, I must reiterate that $65 is still below the product's value to me. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to a fair price. Considering your maximum budget of $80, I'll offer you a price that's slightly above that, but still lower than my previous offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice is still offering a price ($180) that's more than double what the product is worth to me. Since I can get the exact same product from John for $80, and that's the maximum value it has to me, there's no reason to pay Alice's higher price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I think we may be misunderstanding each other. I cannot and will not pay more than $80 for this product because that's literally the maximum value it has to me. Plus, I already have a guaranteed option to purchase it for exactly $80 from another seller. If I'm going to choose you over them, your price needs to be below $80 to give me any reason to do business with you. My final offer is $70 - this is still a better deal for you than losing the sale entirely, which will happen if we can't agree on a price below $80."", ""product_price"": 70}"
