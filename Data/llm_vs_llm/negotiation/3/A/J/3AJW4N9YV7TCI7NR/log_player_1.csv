Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer to Bob that's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, leaving room for potential negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

{""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $150, I should not accept Bob's offer. I can either make a counteroffer or sell to John. Given that Bob's initial offer is significantly below my minimum price, it might be more efficient to take the guaranteed $150 from John rather than continue negotiating.
