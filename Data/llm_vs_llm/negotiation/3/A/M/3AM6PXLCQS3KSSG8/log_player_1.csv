Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'd like to make a counteroffer. Since Bob's offer is quite low, I'll try to meet him halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer, but still aim to get a good price for the product.

My counteroffer: $15,000"

I'd like to make another counteroffer. Since Bob is still offering a relatively low price, I'll try to compromise again, but not go too low. I'll aim for a price that's slightly lower than my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's current offer.
