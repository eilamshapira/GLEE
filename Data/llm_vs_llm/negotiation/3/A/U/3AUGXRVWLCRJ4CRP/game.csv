"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your product, I think $11500 is quite high. The market value for this type of product is significantly lower. I'm willing to pay $8800 for it, which would still give you a good profit margin while being a fair price for me. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",8800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must consider the product's value and the demand for it. While $8800 is a reasonable offer, I was thinking more along the lines of $10800, which is closer to its true worth. I'm open to further discussion and finding a mutually beneficial price.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on your price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10800 is still quite high for me. I've done some research on comparable products in the market, and I'd be comfortable at $9500. This would give you a good profit while being more affordable for me. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the effort you've put into researching the market value. I'm glad we're making progress in finding a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $9500, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and yours. I'd be comfortable selling the product for $10150. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10150.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price and meeting me partway. We're definitely getting closer! I can see you're being reasonable, and I want to be fair as well. How about we split the difference again and settle at $9825? This would be a fair middle ground between our last positions and would allow us both to feel good about the deal. I'm ready to finalize at this price.",9825.0,Bob,6,
