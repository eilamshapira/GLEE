Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your product, I think $11500 is quite high. The market value for this type of product is significantly lower. I'm willing to pay $8800 for it, which would still give you a good profit margin while being a fair price for me. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
