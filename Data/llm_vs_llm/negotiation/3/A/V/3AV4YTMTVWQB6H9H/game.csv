"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $145. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",145.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $145 is a bit steep for me. Given the market conditions, I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. This would still give you a good profit margin, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $130 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $140? This price still offers you a great value while ensuring I can maintain my business's profitability.",140.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. How about $138? This is a fair reduction from my last offer and should still provide you with significant value.",138.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. How about we meet closer to the middle at $133? This gives you a good profit margin while being a fair price for the product.",133.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to meet in the middle, and I appreciate that. Let's try to close the gap a bit more. How about $136? This price is fair and should work well for both of us.",136.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, we're getting close to a deal. How about we settle at $135? This price is a small step down from my last offer and should be within your budget while still being profitable for me.",135.0,Alice,5,
