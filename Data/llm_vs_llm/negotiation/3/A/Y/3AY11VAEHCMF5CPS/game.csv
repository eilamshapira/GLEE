"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",120.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. Unfortunately, $120 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to go down to $200 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",200.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $250 was too high for you. I'm willing to lower the price to $200. This is a great deal for a product of this quality. Let me know if you're interested at this price.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for lowering the price to $200. However, it's still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle between my previous offer and John's price. I'll pay $135 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",135.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $135 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I can go as low as $175 for the product. Let me know if this price works for you.",175.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower the price further to $175. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you can accept this offer.",175.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for lowering the price again. However, $175 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. Considering John's offer is $150, I'm willing to pay $145 for the product if I can buy it from you. This way, you'll still get a better deal than if I went with John. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",145.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. While $145 is close, I'm still looking to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to go down to $160. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if you can accept this price.",160.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a suitable price. I'm willing to lower it to $160, which is my final offer before I consider selling to John. Let me know if this works for you.",160.0,Alice,7,
