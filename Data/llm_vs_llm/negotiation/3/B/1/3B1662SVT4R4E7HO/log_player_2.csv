# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at $200, which is a fair price considering its features and benefits. If you're interested, this is a great opportunity to acquire it. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. You're better off seeing if Alice will lower her price or going with John."
