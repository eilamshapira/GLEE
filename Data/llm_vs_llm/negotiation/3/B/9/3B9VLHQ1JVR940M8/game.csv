"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product. I believe it holds significant worth, and I'm happy to start the conversation at $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $18000 is well beyond what this product is worth to me. I know I can purchase the same product from another seller for $8000, which is the maximum value I place on this item. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer you $5000 for the product, which would save me money compared to my alternative option while still giving you a sale. Let me know if we can work something out.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget and your willingness to work with me.  While I understand your perspective, the $5000 offer is significantly below the value of this product. I'm confident it can bring you significant benefits, and I wouldn't want to devalue it with such a low price.  Could you consider something closer to $14000? This would be a fair compromise, reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $14000 is still significantly above what makes economic sense for me. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I have a confirmed offer from another seller at exactly that price. However, I'd still prefer to do business with you if we can find common ground. I can increase my offer to $6500, which is a substantial improvement from my previous offer while still giving me some savings compared to my alternative. This is a win-win as you make a sale and I save some money. What do you think?",6500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I understand that $8000 is your ideal price point, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  How about we meet halfway between your offer and my previous price at $10500? This feels like a fair compromise, giving us both some ground but acknowledging the true worth of the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
