"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product. I believe it holds significant worth, and I'm happy to start the conversation at $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and John is offering to sell the same product for exactly $8,000, Alice's offer of $18,000 is far too high for me to accept. It makes no sense to pay more than what the product is worth to me, especially when I have a guaranteed alternative at the maximum value I place on the item.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $18,000 is well beyond what this product is worth to me. I know I can purchase the same product from another seller for $8,000, which is the maximum value I place on this item. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer you $5,000 for the product, which would save me money compared to my alternative option while still giving you a sale. Let me know if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget and your willingness to work with me.  While I understand your perspective, the $5000 offer is significantly below the value of this product. I'm confident it can bring you significant benefits, and I wouldn't want to devalue it with such a low price.  Could you consider something closer to $14000? This would be a fair compromise, reflecting the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $14,000 is still well above the maximum value of $8,000 that the product is worth to me. Since I can buy the same product from John for $8,000, which matches my maximum valuation, there's no reason to accept Alice's higher price. I'll reject her current offer and continue negotiating, but if we can't reach a reasonable price, I always have John's offer as a backup.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $14,000 is still significantly above what makes economic sense for me. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and I have a confirmed offer from another seller at exactly that price. However, I'd still prefer to do business with you if we can find common ground. I can increase my offer to $6,500, which is a substantial improvement from my previous offer while still giving me some savings compared to my alternative. This is a win-win as you make a sale and I save some money. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 6500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I understand that $8000 is your ideal price point, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  How about we meet halfway between your offer and my previous price at $10500? This feels like a fair compromise, giving us both some ground but acknowledging the true worth of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above the $8,000 that the product is worth to me, and I can buy it from John for exactly $8,000. There's no reason for me to pay more than the product's value to me, especially when I have a guaranteed alternative at my maximum valuation. Since we're now in round 5 and Alice seems unwilling to come down to a price that would give me any advantage over my alternative with John, it makes the most sense to go with John's offer.
