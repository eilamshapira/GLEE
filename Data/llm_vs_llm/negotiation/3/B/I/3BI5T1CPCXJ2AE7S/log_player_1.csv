Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, I have to consider my budget constraints. I'd like to offer $900000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price. Let me know if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $900,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. My counteroffer will be $1,800,000. This price still reflects the product's value and gives Bob room to negotiate further. 

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,800,000. Let's discuss further.""}"

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $1,000,000 is still below my desired price, but I see that Bob is willing to increase his offer. My counteroffer will be $1,500,000. This price is a compromise, and I hope it will be more acceptable to Bob.
