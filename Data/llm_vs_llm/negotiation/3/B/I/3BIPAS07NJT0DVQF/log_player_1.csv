Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my initial offer. I know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and it's worth at least $10,000 to me. I also have a guaranteed backup option of selling to John for $10,000.

Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, I should aim for a price close to that, while leaving some room for negotiation if needed. I'll start with a relatively high offer, but not so high that Bob immediately rejects it.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob has countered with $11,000, which is significantly lower than my initial offer of $14,000, but still above my minimum acceptable value of $10,000 and slightly better than John's guaranteed offer.

Since this is just the first round of negotiation, I should continue negotiating to try to get a better price from Bob. His initial counter suggests there's room for further negotiation, and the gap between our positions ($14,000 vs $11,000) is one I can work with.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll adjust my counteroffer to be more reasonable while still maintaining good value. Bob's offer of $11,000 is too low, but my initial $14,000 might have been too high. I'll split the difference somewhat, leaning toward my side since I have the $10,000 backup offer from John.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob has now countered with $12,000, which is $1,000 higher than his previous offer. This indicates he's willing to negotiate and is moving in my direction. The $12,000 offer is $2,000 better than my backup option of selling to John for $10,000.

We seem to be converging toward a middle ground. Bob started at $11,000 and has moved to $12,000, while I've moved from $14,000 to $13,000. Since we're only $1,000 apart now, and his current offer is already significantly better than my backup option, I'll accept this offer.
