"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Okay, the price is $150. My maximum willingness to pay is also $150.

Since the offer is exactly my maximum, I am indifferent. However, I know I can always buy it from John for the same price. There is no advantage to accepting Alice's offer over buying from John in this round. Buying from John guarantees I get the product.

Therefore, the best course of action is to buy from John to avoid further negotiation.
