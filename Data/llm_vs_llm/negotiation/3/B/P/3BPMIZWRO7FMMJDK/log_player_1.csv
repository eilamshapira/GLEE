Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $13,500. This price reflects the product's true value while still leaving room for you to benefit from the purchase. Would you like to proceed with this offer?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Could you consider selling it for $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. While $11,000 is above my minimum threshold, there's still significant room for negotiation given that the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. I'll try to find a middle ground between our positions.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $11,000 is too low considering the product's value. I can reduce my initial asking price to $12,500, which is a fair compromise between our positions. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"

# Bob's message: Thanks for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still trying to keep my costs down. Would you be willing to go down to $11500?

I'll accept Bob's offer of $11,500. While it's lower than my initial target, it's still $1,500 better than John's standing offer of $10,000. Given that Bob has moved up from his initial offer and the negotiation might not progress much further, this is a reasonable outcome that provides a decent profit margin."
