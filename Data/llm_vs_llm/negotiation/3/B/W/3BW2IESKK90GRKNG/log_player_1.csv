"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a relatively high price to maximize my potential earnings. However, I'll also keep in mind that the price should be reasonable enough for Bob to consider making a counteroffer.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I also have the option to sell it to John for the same price, I'll consider my next move carefully.

Given that I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, I'd like to try to get a better price from Bob. Selling to John would be a safe option, but it might mean leaving potential profit on the table.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can meet at a higher price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $10,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, my counteroffer will be slightly lower than my initial offer to show that I'm willing to negotiate.

{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's new offer of $9,000 is actually lower than the minimum price I'm willing to accept, which is $10,000. Since selling to John would get me a higher price, I'll consider that option carefully.

However, I still have 6 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I'd like to try to get a better price from him. Accepting an offer of $9,000 would be a bad deal for me, so I'll reject it.

But instead of making a counteroffer, I think I'll consider selling to John, since his offer is higher than Bob's current offer.
