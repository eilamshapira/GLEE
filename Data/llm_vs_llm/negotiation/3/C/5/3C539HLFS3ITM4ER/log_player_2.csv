"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product that I think you'll really appreciate. It's a high-quality item with unique features and lasting value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $180
3. John is offering the same product for $120

Since Alice's offer ($180) is significantly higher than both:
- The maximum value I place on the product ($120)
- John's alternative offer ($120)

It would not be economically rational to accept Alice's offer. Since John's price matches my maximum valuation and is lower than Alice's offer, I should buy from John.
