"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll gain. Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850000, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. How about we do $775000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $775000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $800000, which is my absolute minimum. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings to you. Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
