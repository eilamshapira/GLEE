Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low amount. I will try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll gain. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
