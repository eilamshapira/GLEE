"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a relatively high price to maximize my potential earnings. However, I'll also keep in mind that the price should be reasonable enough for Bob to consider making a counteroffer.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $14,000 is higher than the minimum value of $10,000 that I'm willing to accept, and we are only in Round 2, I think I can try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $14,000, I'll try to find a middle ground between my initial offer of $20,000 and his offer. I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.

{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's new offer of $13,000 is lower than his previous offer of $14,000, which suggests that he may not be willing to pay as much as I had hoped. However, it's still higher than the minimum value of $10,000 that I'm willing to accept.

At this point, I'm not sure if I can get a better price from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether. Since we are only in Round 4, I'll try to negotiate a bit more, but I'll also keep in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiations don't go well.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's last offer was $13,000, and he previously offered $14,000, I'll try to meet him in the middle. I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous offer of $18,000, but still higher than Bob's last offer.
