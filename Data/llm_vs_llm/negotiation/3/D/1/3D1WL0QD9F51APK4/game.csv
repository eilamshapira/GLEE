"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the quality of your product, but the price is a bit higher than I can justify. How about we settle at $700000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $700000 is significantly below the product's market value. Given the product's quality and worth, I cannot go below $1800000. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer, reflecting my willingness to negotiate. Would you consider this more reasonable price?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
