Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $2,000,000. This is a high-quality product with significant market value. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the quality of your product, but the price is a bit higher than I can justify. How about we settle at $700000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since Bob's offer of $700,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 (John's offer), but I want to continue negotiating with Bob as there might be potential to get a better price than John's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $700,000 is significantly below the product's market value. Given the product's quality and worth, I cannot go below $1,800,000. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer, reflecting my willingness to negotiate. Would you consider this more reasonable price?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
