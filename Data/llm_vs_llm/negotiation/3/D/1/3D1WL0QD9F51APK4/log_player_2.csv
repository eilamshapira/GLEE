"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $700000 is significantly below the product's market value. Given the product's quality and worth, I cannot go below $1800000. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer, reflecting my willingness to negotiate. Would you consider this more reasonable price?
