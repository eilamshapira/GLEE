(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Given that:
1. Bob's offers have only increased incrementally ($75, $85, $90)
2. We're already in round 6 out of 10
3. I have a guaranteed $100 offer from John
4. Bob's current offer is still below my minimum acceptable price

It's time to take the guaranteed offer from John rather than risk further negotiation rounds that might not reach $100.
