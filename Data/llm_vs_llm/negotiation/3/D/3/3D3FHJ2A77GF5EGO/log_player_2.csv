"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $150 against what the product is worth to me (no more than $100) and John's alternative offer of $100.

Alice's offer of $150 is higher than what the product is worth to me, and it's also higher than John's price. There's no reason to accept this offer.

Since John is willing to sell the product for $100 (which is the maximum value to me anyway), and Alice is starting negotiations at $150, I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a better price than John's.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's below John's price.

{""product_price"": $75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has reduced her offer from $150 to $125, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this price is still higher than the $100 John is offering, and still higher than what the product is worth to me.

Since John is offering $100, there's no reason for me to accept an offer of $125. I should reject Alice's offer and try another counteroffer that's still below John's price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I see Alice is starting to come down in price. I'll increase my offer a bit from my previous $75, but still maintain a price that would save me money compared to John's offer.

{""product_price"": $85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has reduced her offer further to $115, showing continued willingness to negotiate. However, this price is still higher than John's offer of $100, so it doesn't make sense for me to accept it.

Since John's alternative offer of $100 is still better than Alice's current offer, I should reject and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer a bit more to show goodwill in the negotiation, while still maintaining a price that's better than John's offer.
