"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my premium product to you for $18000. It's a great value and I think you'll be very satisfied with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given the information provided, I'll analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $18,000
3. I can buy the same product from John for $10,000 at any time

Since Alice's asking price ($18,000) is significantly higher than both the product's value to me and John's alternative offer, it doesn't make sense to accept Alice's current offer.

I also don't need to make a counteroffer to Alice since I already have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $10,000, which is the maximum value the product has to me.
