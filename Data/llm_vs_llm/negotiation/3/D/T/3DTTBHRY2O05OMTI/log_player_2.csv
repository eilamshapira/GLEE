"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,400,000 is closer to my limit, I know Alice is trying to sell for a profit. There's room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This gives us room to negotiate towards a price that works for both of us, hopefully closer to my $1,200,000 limit."
