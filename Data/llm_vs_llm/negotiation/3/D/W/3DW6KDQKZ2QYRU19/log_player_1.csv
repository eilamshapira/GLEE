Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I've got something you might be interested in. How about $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that's a bit high for me. How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, let's analyze this. Bob is offering $85. Selling to John gets me $80. I need to decide if I can get a better price from Bob. Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, and he initially wanted to pay $110, I believe there is still room for negotiation.
