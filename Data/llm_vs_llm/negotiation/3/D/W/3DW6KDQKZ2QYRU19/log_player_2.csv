I'm starting with a reasonably low offer but leaving room to negotiate upward towards a price that's still a good deal for me."

You have three options:

We're in a good bargaining position now.  Splitting the difference again keeps the negotiation moving but sets me up to potentially get the product for a price closer to my ideal range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I really want to make this work! How about we settle on $92? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

This is a fair price and a good compromise. Better to secure the deal now at a good price than risk it going higher."
