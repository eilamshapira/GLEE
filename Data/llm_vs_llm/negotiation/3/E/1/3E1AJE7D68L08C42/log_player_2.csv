"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll analyze this offer:

Alice is offering the product for $1,150,000.
The product is worth at most $1,200,000 to me.
John is willing to sell it for $1,200,000.
Alice's offer is $50,000 less than John's price.
The product costs Alice $1,000,000, so she's looking for a $150,000 profit.

Since Alice's offer is already better than John's price, and we have room to negotiate further, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $1,050,000}"
