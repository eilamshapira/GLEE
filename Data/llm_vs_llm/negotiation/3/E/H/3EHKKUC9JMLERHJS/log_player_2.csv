"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I’m excited to present you with an exclusive offer: I’m willing to sell this exceptional product for $1199999. Given its unique value and the immediate opportunity to acquire it, I believe this is a deal you won’t want to miss. I look forward to your prompt acceptance. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,199,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,199,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,199,999 is less than the $1,200,000 I'm willing to pay, and also less than what I can buy it from John for, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer to save $1.
