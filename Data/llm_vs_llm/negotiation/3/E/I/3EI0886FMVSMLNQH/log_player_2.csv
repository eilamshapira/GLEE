"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product that I think you'll really love. It's a one-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice is offering it for $149
3. John's price is $150
4. Alice's offer saves me $1 compared to John's price

While Alice's offer is technically better than John's price by $1, it's still very close to my maximum value of $150. Given that Alice's product is worth only $80 to her, this seems like an extremely high markup. 

By rejecting this offer, I might:
1. Send a signal that the price is too high
2. Get a better counter-offer from Alice
3. At worst, I can still buy from John at $150
