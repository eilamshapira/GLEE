"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2500000. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm open to negotiations if you have a different valuation in mind.",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, while I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, my budget constraints limit me to a maximum of $1000000. Could you consider selling it to me for $750000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $750000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for $2200000. I'm still open to negotiations, but I need to get closer to the product's true worth.",2200000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but my budget is strictly limited to $1000000. Given that, I'm willing to increase my offer to $800000. This is the best I can do within my constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $800000 is still below my expectations. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $2000000. If this is still out of your budget, I may need to consider other options.",2000000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm really constrained by my budget. I can go up to $850000, which is the absolute maximum I can offer. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,6,
