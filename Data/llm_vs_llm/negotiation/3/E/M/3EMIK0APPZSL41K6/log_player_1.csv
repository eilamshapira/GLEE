Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, my budget constraints limit me to a maximum of $1000000. Could you consider selling it to me for $750000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and even lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have room to negotiate and potentially reach a better price. 

Here's my counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $750,000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for $2,200,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but my budget is strictly limited to $1000000. Given that, I'm willing to increase my offer to $800000. This is the best I can do within my constraints. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Since Bob's offer of $800,000 is still significantly lower than my expectations and lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer. However, I notice that Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which suggests that he may be willing to go higher. I'll make another counteroffer to try to get closer to a mutually acceptable price.

Here's my counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $800,000 is still below my expectations. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $2,000,000. If this is still out of your budget, I may need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"

Bob's offer:

Given that Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly lower than what John is willing to pay, and Bob has indicated that $850,000 is his absolute maximum, I don't see any further room for negotiation. It's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer again, and I'm not willing to sell the product for a price that is $650,000 below what John is offering. Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
