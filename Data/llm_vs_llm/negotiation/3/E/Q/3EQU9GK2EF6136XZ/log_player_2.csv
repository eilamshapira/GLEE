"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $12,000 is equal to Alice's valuation and significantly above my maximum valuation of $8,000. It would not be rational to accept this offer when I can either negotiate for a lower price or buy from John for $8,000. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $7,000, which is below John's price of $8,000. This gives room for negotiation while still being potentially profitable for Alice (as her cost is likely below this price since she's willing to sell). If Alice rejects this, we can negotiate towards a middle ground, but I always have the option to go to John at $8,000 if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $11,500 is still well above my maximum valuation of $8,000 and John's fixed price. While Alice has moved down from her initial offer, the price is still too high. I'll reject and make another counteroffer. There's no reason to accept a price higher than my maximum valuation when I have John's guaranteed offer of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7500}

I'll increase my offer slightly to $7,500 to show willingness to negotiate, but still maintain a price below John's $8,000 offer. This gives Alice a chance to make a profit while keeping my options open. If Alice continues to make high counteroffers, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $8,000. Here's why:
1. Alice's offers are still far above my maximum valuation of $8,000
2. Alice has only made small reductions in price ($12,000 -> $11,500 -> $11,000)
3. The pace of negotiations suggests we're unlikely to reach a price below $8,000
4. We've already used half of our available rounds
5. John's offer of $8,000 is guaranteed and matches my maximum valuation

It's better to secure the deal at my maximum acceptable price than risk more rounds of negotiation that seem unlikely to result in a better outcome."
