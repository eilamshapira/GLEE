"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product you're selling, but I need to be transparent - the maximum value of this product to me is $1000000. In fact, I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for exactly that amount. I'd like to buy from you instead, but your price is significantly higher than what I can justify. I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product, which would give me a reason to choose you over the alternative. Let me know if we can work with this price.",750000.0,Bob,2,
