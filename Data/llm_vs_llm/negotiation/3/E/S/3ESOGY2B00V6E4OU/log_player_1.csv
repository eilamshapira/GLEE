Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,000,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product you're selling, but I need to be transparent - the maximum value of this product to me is $1000000. In fact, I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for exactly that amount. I'd like to buy from you instead, but your price is significantly higher than what I can justify. I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product, which would give me a reason to choose you over the alternative. Let me know if we can work with this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
