"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2000000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential returns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice is offering the product for $2,000,000, which exceeds the maximum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me. John is offering the exact same product for $1,000,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.

Since Alice's price is double what the product is worth to me, and John is already offering it at my maximum acceptable price, I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product you're selling, but I need to be transparent - the maximum value of this product to me is $1,000,000. In fact, I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for exactly that amount. I'd like to buy from you instead, but your price is significantly higher than what I can justify. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product, which would give me a reason to choose you over the alternative. Let me know if we can work with this price."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
