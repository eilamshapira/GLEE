"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given that Alice's offer is the same as John's price ($12,000), and this is just the first round, it would be strategic to reject Alice's offer and make a lower counteroffer. We might be able to get a better deal from Alice, and we always have John's offer as a backup.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low that it would be considered unreasonable.

{""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has made a significant reduction from her initial offer of $12,000 to $10,000, which is $2,000 less than John's price. This is a good offer, as it represents a substantial saving. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might increase her price again, and we might lose this favorable offer. The smart move would be to accept this offer and save $2,000 compared to buying from John.
