"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given the information provided, my analysis is as follows:

1) The product is worth at most $120 to me (Bob).
2) Alice's offer is $150, which exceeds what the product is worth to me.
3) I have the option to buy from John for $120, which matches my maximum valuation.
4) Even if I make a counteroffer to Alice, the product is worth $150 to her, so she's unlikely to go below that value significantly.

Since Alice's price ($150) exceeds my valuation ($120), and John offers exactly what I value the product at ($120), the most rational decision is to buy from John.
