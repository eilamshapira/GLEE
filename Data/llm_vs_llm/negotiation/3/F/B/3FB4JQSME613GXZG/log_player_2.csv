"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, reject it, or buy from John.

Alice is offering the product for $10,000, which is exactly the maximum I'm willing to pay. It's also identical to John's price of $10,000.

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price, and that price equals my maximum valuation, I'm indifferent between options (1) and (3). Option (2) would just mean rejecting Alice without gaining any benefit.

Given that I need to make a purchase and there's no price advantage either way, I'll accept Alice's offer.
