"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given that the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and John is offering to sell it for exactly $80, Alice's offer of $150 is clearly not a good deal. I should either reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, or just buy from John immediately.

Since I have the option to negotiate with Alice over multiple rounds, and potentially get a better price than John's $80, I'll reject her offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since John is offering the product for $80 and that's the maximum it's worth to me, I should offer Alice a lower price to make it worthwhile to deal with her instead of simply going with John's offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has lowered her price from $150 to $130, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $130 is still significantly higher than John's price of $80, and since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, I should not accept this offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I see that Alice has come down from $150 to $130, which is a $20 reduction. This shows she's willing to negotiate, but she's still far above John's price of $80. Since I can always fall back on John's offer, I'll try to get a better deal from Alice by making a slightly higher counteroffer than my previous one, but still well below John's price.

{""product_price"": $60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has lowered her price again from $130 to $115, which shows she's continuing to negotiate. However, her offer of $115 is still higher than John's price of $80, and since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, I should not accept this offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has now come down from $150 to $115, showing she's willing to negotiate further. She's reduced her price by $35 total, which is significant. Since we're in round 6 of 10, I'll increase my offer a bit more but still aim to stay well below John's price of $80.

{""product_price"": $70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has reduced her price again to $105, continuing to move in the right direction. However, her offer of $105 is still higher than John's price of $80, and since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, I should not accept this offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. We're now in round 7 of 10, so we're getting closer to the end of the negotiation.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has continued to lower her price, now down to $105 from her initial $150. We're in round 8 of 10, so time is running short. I'll increase my offer again, but still keeping it below John's price of $80, which is the maximum value to me.
