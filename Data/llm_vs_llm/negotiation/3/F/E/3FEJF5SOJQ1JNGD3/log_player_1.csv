"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($80). This gives me room to negotiate down while still aiming for a good profit.
*   **Information Gathering:** Bob's response will tell me a lot about his perceived value of the product. If he immediately rejects, I know I need to adjust my strategy.
*   **Psychology:** Anchoring with a higher price can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and make him more willing to pay a premium, even after negotiation.
*   **John's Offer in mind:** I always keep John's offer of $80 in mind, and am ready to opt out if I am not making a satisfying value above that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. While selling to John guarantees $80, I have 9 rounds left to potentially get a higher price from Bob. Rejecting now and making a more reasonable counteroffer is worth the risk, as long as I remain prepared to sell to John if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for Round 3:

```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Moving Down, But Not Too Much:** I'm reducing the price from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a significant profit above my minimum.
*   **Showing Flexibility:** This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate and not completely rigid on the price.
*   **Testing Bob's Limits:** This price will give me a better indication of Bob's true budget and how much he values the product. Is $80 his actual limit, or is he just starting low?
*   **Strategic Increment:** The drop isn't so drastic that I look desperate, but it is large enough to hopefully encourage a more serious counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is a small improvement over $80, it's still significantly below what I believe is a reasonable price. I'm confident I can get more from Bob with a few more rounds of negotiation. Selling to John at this point would be leaving money on the table. The fact that Bob increased his offer suggests he does value the product somewhat."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Continuing to Negotiate Down:** I am lowering the price again, but at a smaller increment than before. This signals that I am getting closer to my bottom line.
*   **Aiming for a Realistic Price:** $115 still allows for a healthy profit margin while being more attractive than my previous offer.
*   **Encouraging a Serious Counteroffer:** I hope that this offer will prompt Bob to make a more substantial increase in his offer if he is truly interested in buying.
*   **Considering Remaining Rounds:** With 6 rounds remaining (including this one), I still have time to find a mutually acceptable price or opt-out to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is inching up, but only slowly. $95 is better than $80, but still not good enough. I believe I can still squeeze more out of him. I have 4 rounds left, including the next one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Smaller Increment:** I'm reducing the price by a smaller amount this time. This signals that I am nearing my lowest acceptable offer.
*   **Testing Bob's Commitment:** This offer will test how serious Bob is about buying the product. A small increase from him would indicate genuine interest.
*   **Weighing Options:** With only four rounds left, I'm carefully considering the risk/reward. If Bob's next offer is still too low, I might consider selling to John to avoid wasting more time.
*   **Sticking to a Minimum Profit:** $105 still gives me a decent profit above my $80 minimum, so I'm willing to continue negotiations for now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

$98 is still too low, especially considering the limited time remaining. The increments are getting smaller on Bob's end, and I don't like the trend. I have only 2 rounds left including the next. It is still worth a try to try to squeeze something more, but I will need to consider John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 102}
```

**Explanation:**

Okay, one last try.

*   **Tiny Increment Down:** I'm barely moving on the price. This communicates that this is essentially my final offer.
*   **""Take it or leave it"" Signal:** I am implicitly signalling Bob that this is as good as it's going to get.
*   **John is Looming:** If Bob rejects this offer, I am almost certainly selling to John. I need a compelling reason *not* to take the guaranteed $80.
*   **Worth the Gamble:** The $2 increase is worth the gamble, as I'd prefer to get even a little more than $80 if possible. If I don't get a good offer from Bob in the next and final round, I will sell to John."
