"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: Pay $9,900
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: Pay $10,000

Alice's offer ($9,900) is only slightly lower than John's price ($10,000), with just a $100 difference. While it is technically a better deal than John's offer, there's a possibility that by rejecting Alice's initial offer, she might come back with a better price since the product is worth $8,000 to her and she has room to lower the price.

Therefore, I choose to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
