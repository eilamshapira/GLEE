"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $145. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value.",145.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $145 is a bit high for me. Given the current market conditions, I'd be comfortable purchasing it for $130, which would still provide you with a reasonable profit. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your position, $130 is lower than what I can accept for this product. Given its quality and market value, I can offer it to you for $138. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents a fair deal for both of us.",138.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down in price, Alice. I appreciate that. I'm still finding $138 a bit high for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $134? This would be a fair compromise between your offer and my previous suggestion, and I'd be ready to purchase immediately at this price.",134.0,Bob,4,
