"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $145. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $145, which is less than the $150 I'm willing to pay maximum. However, I want to save as much money as possible.

Since Alice values the product at $120, there's room for negotiation. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as I can potentially get it for less than $145, and I always have the option to buy from John at $150 as a backup.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $145 is a bit high for me.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your position, $130 is lower than what I can accept for this product. Given its quality and market value, I can offer it to you for $138. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has come down from $145 to $138, which is a good sign. Since the product is worth $120 to her, she still has room to negotiate. The current offer of $138 is already better than John's price of $150, but I should try one more counteroffer to save more money.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down in price, Alice. I appreciate that. I'm still finding $138 a bit high for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $134? This would be a fair compromise between your offer and my previous suggestion, and I'd be ready to purchase immediately at this price."", ""product_price"": 134}"
