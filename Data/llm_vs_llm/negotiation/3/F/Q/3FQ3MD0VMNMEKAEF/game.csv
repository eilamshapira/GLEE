"Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $11000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $11000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $12500? That's a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $12500 is still a bit high for me. Could you go down to $11500? I think that would be a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I'm not comfortable going as low as $11500, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12000?  That's my final offer. Let me know what you decide.",12000.0,Alice,5,
