Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, considering Bob's counteroffer of $95, I need to make a decision. My options are:

*   **Accept Bob's offer:** I'd make a profit of $95 (selling price) - $80 (my minimum value) = $15.
*   **Reject and Counteroffer:** This could potentially lead to a higher price from Bob, but it also risks him walking away or offering a lower price.
*   **Sell to John:** I would earn $80, which is my minimum acceptable price and guarantee.

Since I want to earn as much as possible, I will **Reject Bob's offer** and make a counteroffer.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```"
