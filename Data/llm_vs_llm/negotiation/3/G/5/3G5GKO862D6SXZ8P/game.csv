"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. Unfortunately, $100 is too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $220?",220.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down from $250, but $220 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your new offer. How about $160?",160.0,Bob,4,
