"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $15000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an exceptional item, and I believe it will be a valuable addition for you. Please let me know if you're interested or have any questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer ($15,000) is higher than both my maximum valuation ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000), it would not be rational to accept her offer. Also, since I can guarantee getting the product from John at $10,000, there's no need to continue negotiating with Alice when her opening offer is this high. The best decision is to buy from John.
