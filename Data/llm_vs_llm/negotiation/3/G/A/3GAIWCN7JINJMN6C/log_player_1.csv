"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a high offer to Bob to see if there's room for negotiation while maintaining my profit.

{""product_price"": 1,500,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and even below his own valuation ($800,000). Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, and Bob's opening offer is so low, it doesn't make sense to continue negotiations.
