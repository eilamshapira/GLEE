"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to present you with a unique product that I believe could greatly benefit you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $15,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. While I could negotiate with Alice, since I already have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $12,000, which is exactly my maximum value, I'll choose to buy from John to ensure I get the product at an acceptable price.
