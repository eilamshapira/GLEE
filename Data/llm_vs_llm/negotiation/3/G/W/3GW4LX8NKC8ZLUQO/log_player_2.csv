"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given the information:
- The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me
- Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000
- John is also offering the product for $1,200,000

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price of $1,200,000, and this is exactly at my maximum valuation, I am indifferent between accepting Alice's offer or buying from John. However, since rejecting Alice's offer without buying from John would leave me without the product, my decision is:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
