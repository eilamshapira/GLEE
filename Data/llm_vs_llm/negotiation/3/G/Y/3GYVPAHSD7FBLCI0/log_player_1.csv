Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a reasonably high price to leave room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","$60 is far too low and well below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, there's no reason to accept such a low offer. However, I'll reject and try one more counteroffer with Bob before potentially selling to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price significantly from my initial offer but still maintain a price above my minimum to leave some room for negotiation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer of $80 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and he's only increased his offer by $20 from his previous bid. Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $150, and Bob's offers are remaining very low, it's time to end the negotiation and take the guaranteed sale.
