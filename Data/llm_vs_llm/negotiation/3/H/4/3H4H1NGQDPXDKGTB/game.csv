"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the potential in the product, my budget constraints lead me to propose a counteroffer. How about $850000 for the product? Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $850000 is significantly below the product's true value. While I'm willing to be flexible from my initial price, I need to ensure I receive fair value. I can offer you the product for $1000000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer while reflecting the product's worth.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
