Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the potential in the product, my budget constraints lead me to propose a counteroffer. How about $850000 for the product? Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. $850,000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and I know the product is worth significantly more to Bob."
