"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking for a more reasonable price. I would like to make a counteroffer of $8000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8000 matches my minimum threshold, I believe the product offers significantly more value. The quality, durability, and performance features justify a higher price point. I can reduce my initial offer to $12500. This represents a substantial discount from my initial price while still reflecting the product's true value.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $12500 is still quite high for my budget. I would like to counter at $9000 for the product.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see we're making progress in our negotiation. Thank you for increasing your offer to $9000. That's a step in the right direction, but I'm still not able to go that low considering the product's quality and market value. I can come down to $11200. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction - you'll receive excellent value while I receive reasonable compensation for this premium product.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued offers, Alice. While I appreciate your flexibility, $11200 is still above my budget. I would like to counter at $9500 for the product.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your increased offer of $9500. We're getting closer. I can see you're genuinely interested in the product, and I want to make this work for both of us. I can come down to $10300. This represents my best price while still acknowledging the product's true value. At this price point, you're getting exceptional value for your investment, and I hope we can finalize our agreement.",10300.0,Alice,7,
