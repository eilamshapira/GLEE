"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that Alice's offer of $250 is significantly higher than John's price of $100, and the product is only worth up to $100 to me, it doesn't make sense to accept this offer. Since I can always buy from John for $100, I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer.
