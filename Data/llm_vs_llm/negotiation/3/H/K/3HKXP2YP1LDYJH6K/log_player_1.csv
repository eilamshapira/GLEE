"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to my target of $1,500,000, but leaving some room for negotiation. This should encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to settle on a price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,150,000 is a significant amount, I believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations.  The product is worth more to Bob, and I am confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. I'm aiming for a price that's still attractive to Bob, but also closer to my desired price point. Hopefully, this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better price if I continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

I'm offering a middle ground this time, splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's last offer. This shows good faith and demonstrates my willingness to find a solution that works for both of us."
