"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than John's price of $1,500,000, but still seems high considering Alice's product is worth $1,000,000 to her, I should reject and make a counteroffer to try getting a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still gives her a reasonable profit above her $1,000,000 value.

{""product_price"": 1,150,000}

This offer would give Alice a $150,000 profit while saving me $350,000 compared to her initial offer and $450,000 compared to John's price. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it leaves room for potential compromise while still being a fair offer above Alice's valuation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her price by $100,000 from her initial offer, showing she's willing to negotiate. However, there's still room for a better deal since her cost is $1,000,000. I'll reject this offer and try another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still aim for a good deal. Since Alice came down $100,000, I'll move up by a similar amount from my last offer.

{""product_price"": 1,200,000}

This offer splits the difference between my last offer ($1,150,000) and her latest offer ($1,300,000). It would give Alice a $200,000 profit while still being significantly better than both her last offer and John's price. It shows I'm willing to negotiate while maintaining a strong position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has come down to $1,250,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial $1,400,000 offer. She's showing willingness to negotiate and this price is $250,000 less than John's price. Given that:
1. We're already in round 5 (halfway through)
2. The price is now much closer to a fair middle ground between her cost ($1,000,000) and my maximum ($1,500,000)
3. She's giving us a $250,000 savings compared to John's price
4. There's a risk of losing more rounds without much better improvement

I'll accept this offer.
