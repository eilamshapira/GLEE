Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 150}

This offer is above what the product is worth to Bob ($100), but it gives room for negotiation while starting from a strong position. If Bob rejects this, I can expect a counteroffer and adjust accordingly, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","I'll reject Bob's offer of $80 because:
1. It's below my minimum acceptable value of $100
2. I already have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $100
3. Bob's low counteroffer of $80 suggests they're not likely to meet my minimum acceptable price

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

This is the most rational decision as it guarantees me $100, which is both my minimum acceptable price and more than Bob's current offer. Continuing negotiations with Bob might waste time, and given their low counteroffer, they might not be willing to pay what I need."
