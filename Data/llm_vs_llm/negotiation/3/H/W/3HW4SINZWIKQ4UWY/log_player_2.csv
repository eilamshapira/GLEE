"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given that I'm looking for a product that's worth no more than $80 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $80, Alice's offer of $180 is far too high. Alice's product is worth $150 to her, so there's room for negotiation, but her initial offer is unreasonable.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that acknowledges the value of the product to both of us.

{""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has reduced her price from $180 to $160, which shows some willingness to negotiate. However, this is still double the amount the product is worth to me ($80), and it's also double what I can pay John for the same product. Since the product is worth $150 to Alice, there's still room for her to reduce the price further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice is only slightly reducing her price each time, moving from $180 to $160 to $155. Her current offer of $155 is still much higher than the $80 maximum I'm willing to pay, and higher than John's guaranteed price of $80. Since we're already at round 5 of 10, and Alice doesn't seem to be making meaningful concessions, it would be sensible to either:

1) Make one more counteroffer slightly higher than before, or
2) Take John's guaranteed offer

Given that Alice's product is worth $150 to her, and my last offer of $75 was rejected, it seems we may not reach a mutually acceptable price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
