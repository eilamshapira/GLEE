"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:

- Alice is offering the product for $100
- The product is worth no more than $100 to me
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $100
- My goal is to buy the product while saving money

Since Alice's offer ($100) is exactly the same as John's price ($100), and both equal the maximum value I place on the product, I'm indifferent between the options. I won't save any money by choosing one over the other.
