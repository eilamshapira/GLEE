Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this price offer.

I know the product is worth at least $120 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120. Therefore, any offer to Bob should be above $120 to potentially maximize my profit.

Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'll set a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but not so high that it would likely deter most buyers. A 50% markup from my minimum value would be reasonable.
