"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price of $80, the rational decision would be to buy from John.
