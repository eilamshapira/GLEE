"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. After careful consideration, I'm offering it to you at a price of $1200000. This is a competitive price for the quality and value this product will bring to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $600000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must decline your offer of $600000 as it's substantially below the product's value. I should mention that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1000000 for this product. That said, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. My counteroffer is $950000, which represents a significant discount from my initial price and is also below what my alternative buyer is offering. This is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product while giving you a better deal than my other option.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $950000 is still above what I'm willing to spend. Given that I have another option at $800000, I'd like to counter with $700000. This is a fair compromise considering my budget constraints and your need to sell. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
