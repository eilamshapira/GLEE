Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must decline your offer of $600,000 as it's substantially below the product's value. I should mention that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product. That said, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. My counteroffer is $950,000, which represents a significant discount from my initial price and is also below what my alternative buyer is offering. This is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product while giving you a better deal than my other option."", ""product_price"": 950000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $950000 is still above what I'm willing to spend. Given that I have another option at $800000, I'd like to counter with $700000. This is a fair compromise considering my budget constraints and your need to sell. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.
