"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $120. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given that Alice is offering the product for $120, which is more than what it's worth to me ($80), and also more than what John is offering ($80), it doesn't make sense to accept this offer.

I have the option to either reject and make a counteroffer to Alice, or simply buy from John for $80. Since John's price is exactly at my maximum value, and there's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower price than $100 (since that's what it's worth to her), the rational choice is to buy from John.
