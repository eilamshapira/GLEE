"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $10000 is below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $13500? This price reflects a significant discount while still valuing the product appropriately. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in our product. After considering your budget, I'm willing to lower the price further to $13000. This is the best I can do while still maintaining the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. I understand you need to maintain value, but I'm still trying to stay closer to my target. How about $11500? I'm really interested in this product.",11500.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your latest offer. However, $11500 is still below our minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $12500, which is very close to your last offer and still within a reasonable range for us. Let me know if this works for you.",12500.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're close to finding a mutually beneficial price. I can go down to $12250, which is a fair compromise considering both our needs. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",12250.0,Alice,5,
