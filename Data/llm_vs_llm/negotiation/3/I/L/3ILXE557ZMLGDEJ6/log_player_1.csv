Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I understand that you believe the product has great value, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000, considering the product's worth and the price I'm willing to pay.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your continued efforts to negotiate. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think the price can be lower. Considering my budget and the fact that I can buy the product from John for $800000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $775000. This is my final offer before I consider alternative options, and I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

I decide to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. Bob's final offer of $775,000 is still significantly lower than the product's worth to me, and I have a better alternative option with John. Since Bob mentioned he can buy the product from John for $800,000, it's likely that John is willing to pay a premium for the product, which I can take advantage of. Selling to John ensures I get a fair price for the product, and I don't have to continue negotiating with Bob."
