"Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product to offer you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2500000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value. Would you be interested in making this investment?",2500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand that the product is valuable, but $2500000 is beyond my budget. I would like to offer $900000, which I believe is a fair price reflecting both the product's quality and my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $900000 is below the product's actual value. I understand my initial price might have been high, so I'm willing to adjust it. Given the product's quality and market value, I can offer it for $1800000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents excellent value for such a premium product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $1800000 is still slightly above my budget. How about we settle at $1200000? I believe this is a reasonable compromise that reflects the product's value and my budgetary constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
