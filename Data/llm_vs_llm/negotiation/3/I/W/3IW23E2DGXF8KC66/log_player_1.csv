"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product to offer you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,500,000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value. Would you be interested in making this investment?"", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand that the product is valuable, but $2500000 is beyond my budget. I would like to offer $900000, which I believe is a fair price reflecting both the product's quality and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Given that Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 (which I can get from John), I'll reject this offer. I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round, lowering my initial price somewhat but still maintaining a price well above my reservation value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $900,000 is below the product's actual value. I understand my initial price might have been high, so I'm willing to adjust it. Given the product's quality and market value, I can offer it for $1,800,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents excellent value for such a premium product."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $1800000 is still slightly above my budget. How about we settle at $1200000? I believe this is a reasonable compromise that reflects the product's value and my budgetary constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,200,000. This is a reasonable price that's well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 (John's offer), and Bob has shown good faith in negotiating by making a significant increase from his initial offer. While we might potentially negotiate for a higher price, there's always the risk of Bob walking away, and this offer represents a good profit margin above my reservation price."
