Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 150}

Since the product is worth $150 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $150, there's no reason for me to offer Bob a lower price. Even though Bob values the product at $100, any price below $150 would result in me losing money compared to selling to John. Therefore, I'll offer it to Bob at $150, knowing that if he rejects it (which he likely will since it's above his valuation), I can still sell to John for the same amount."
