"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value, $1200000 is a bit higher than I was anticipating. Would you consider $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position. However, given the product's value and features, I believe $900000 is still below its fair market value. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1050000, which I think represents a reasonable middle ground. This price reflects both the product's quality and accounts for your budget concerns. Would this work for you?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
