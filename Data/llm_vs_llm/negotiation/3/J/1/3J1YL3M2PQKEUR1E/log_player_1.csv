"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential return on investment. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value, $1200000 is a bit higher than I was anticipating. Would you consider $900000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a better price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position. However, given the product's value and features, I believe $900,000 is still below its fair market value. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1,050,000, which I think represents a reasonable middle ground. This price reflects both the product's quality and accounts for your budget concerns. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about $975000? I'm willing to move a bit, but need to stay within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $975,000. This is a good price that's significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and Bob has shown good faith in negotiating up from his initial offer. While we could continue negotiating, there's always a risk of losing the deal, and this represents a solid profit margin."
