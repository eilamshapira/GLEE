Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to set a price for my product that maximizes my earnings. Since I know the product is worth at least $100 to me (and I can always sell it to John for exactly $100), I should set a price above $100.

Without knowing Bob's exact valuation, I'll set a reasonable markup that gives me a good profit while still being potentially acceptable to Bob.
