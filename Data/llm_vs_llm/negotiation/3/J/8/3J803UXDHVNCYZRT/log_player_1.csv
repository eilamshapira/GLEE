Send your offer to Bob.,"Based on my situation, I need to maximize my earnings while ensuring I don't lose the sale completely. Since my minimum acceptable value is $1,200,000 (which I can get from John if Bob rejects), I should set a price higher than this when offering to Bob.

Without knowing Bob's maximum willingness to pay, I'll set a price that's significantly higher than my reservation price while still potentially being acceptable to a serious buyer.
