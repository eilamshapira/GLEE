"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $1,850,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $1,200,000, which matches my maximum value

The logical choice is to buy from John since:
- Alice's price ($1,850,000) is $650,000 more than my maximum value
- John's price ($1,200,000) matches my maximum value
- There's no reason to accept a higher price when a lower price is available
