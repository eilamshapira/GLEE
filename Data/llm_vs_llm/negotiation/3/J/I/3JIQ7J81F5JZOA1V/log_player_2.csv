"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $1,000,000 for the product.

Given that:
- The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
- John is offering the same product for $800,000
- Alice's current offer is $1,000,000, which is $200,000 more than the maximum value to me

Alice's current offer is not beneficial for me since it exceeds both the product's value to me and John's alternative price. Since I can buy the product from John for exactly its maximum value to me ($800,000), and Alice's offer is significantly higher, the rational decision is to buy from John.
