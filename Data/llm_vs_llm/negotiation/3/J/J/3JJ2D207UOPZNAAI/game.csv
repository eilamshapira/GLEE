Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it will be a great fit for you. How about I sell it to you for $15000?,15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer! However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I appreciate your response. While I understand your budget, I can't go as low as $10000. How about I meet you halfway at $12500? I believe it's a fair price for such a valuable product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I understand your position, but $12500 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $11000? I think this would be a good compromise for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! Thanks for your continued interest. I appreciate your offer, but I can't go down to $11000. How about we settle at $12000? It's the lowest I can go, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",12000.0,Alice,5,
