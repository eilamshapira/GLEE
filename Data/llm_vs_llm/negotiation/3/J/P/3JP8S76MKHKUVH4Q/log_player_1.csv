Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price to offer to Bob. I know the product is worth at least $150 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I should offer a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $150. If Bob accepts, I'll make more than my guaranteed $150 from John. If Bob rejects, I still have John's offer as my backup.

I'll offer a price that gives me a good chance to make a meaningful profit above my $150 floor, while still being potentially attractive to Bob.
