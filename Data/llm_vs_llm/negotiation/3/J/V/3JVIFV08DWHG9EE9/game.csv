"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth a significant amount of money. I'm confident that it can be incredibly valuable to the right person. While I can't disclose specifics at this time, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a price I've carefully considered, and I believe it reflects the product's true potential. If you're interested, let's discuss it further. However, if this isn't the right fit for you, I understand, and I'll be selling it to another buyer.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
