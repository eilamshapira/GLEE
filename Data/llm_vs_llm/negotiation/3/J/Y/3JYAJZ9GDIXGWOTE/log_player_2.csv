"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer of $2,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,500,000 and also higher than John's offer. It would be unwise to accept this offer. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be insulting.

{""product_price"": 1000000}

This offer is reasonable because:
1. It's well below my maximum value of $1,500,000
2. It gives room for negotiation upward
3. It's significant enough to be taken seriously
4. It provides a good anchor point for further negotiations
5. If Alice rejects, I still have John's offer of $1,500,000 as a backup"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $2,300,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's offer ($1,500,000). While Alice has reduced the price by $200,000, it's still not close enough to be acceptable. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, as there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still stay well below my maximum value.

{""product_price"": 1200000}

This counteroffer is strategic because:
1. It shows willingness to negotiate by increasing from my previous offer of $1,000,000
2. It's still significantly below my maximum value of $1,500,000
3. It maintains room for further negotiation
4. It signals that while I'm flexible, I won't go anywhere near Alice's current asking price
5. I still have John's offer as a backup if negotiations fail
6. The $200,000 increase matches Alice's decrease, showing I'm responding proportionally to her movement"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $2,100,000 is still $600,000 above John's price and my maximum value. While Alice is showing willingness to negotiate by reducing the price further, the current offer is still too high. Since we're at round 5 (halfway through), I'll make another counteroffer, but I need to be mindful that if we can't reach a reasonable agreement soon, I should consider taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm making a more substantial increase in my offer because:
1. We're more than halfway through the negotiation rounds
2. I'm showing serious intent by moving closer to my maximum value
3. The offer is still below both my maximum value and John's price ($1,500,000)
4. Alice has shown consistent willingness to reduce her price
5. This significant jump in my offer (from $1,200,000 to $1,350,000) shows good faith in negotiating
6. If Alice doesn't respond with a reasonable counter, I can still fall back on John's offer

This leaves just enough room for one more potential counteroffer from me if needed, while also sending a strong signal that I won't go much higher."
