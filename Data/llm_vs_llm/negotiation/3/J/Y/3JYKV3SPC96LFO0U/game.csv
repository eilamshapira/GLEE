"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1200000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. Given the unique value and quality of this product, I can’t go as low as $1200000. My counteroffer is $1750000. I believe this reflects both the market value and the exclusivity of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the value you're placing on the product, but $1750000 is still above what I can justify spending. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $1350000. This is my best offer considering my budget constraints. Let me know if this could work for you.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
