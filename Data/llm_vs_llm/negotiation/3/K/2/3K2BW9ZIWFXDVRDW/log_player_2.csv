Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but I can't go below $10000 as that represents my absolute minimum price point.

Given the quality and value of this product, I can offer it to you at $12500, which is already significantly reduced from my initial price. Would this work for you?
