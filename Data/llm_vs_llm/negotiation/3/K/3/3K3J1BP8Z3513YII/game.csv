"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that my initial price may have been higher than you expected. However, I believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Here's a counteroffer that I think better reflects the product's worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations. I'm willing to increase my offer to $200000. I believe this is a fair offer considering we are still early in negotiations.",200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and the effort to close the gap between our valuations. However, I still believe the product's worth is substantially higher than your current offer. I'm willing to continue negotiating and have lowered my price to $1500000, which I think is a more reasonable compromise considering the product's value and our ongoing discussion.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see we're making some progress, but your current offer remains outside my budget. To meet you halfway, I'm proposing $350000. This offer reflects a significant increase on my part, and I hope it demonstrates my serious interest in the product.",350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate the significant increase in your offer, demonstrating your serious interest in the product. After careful consideration, I've decided to make a final adjustment to my price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. This offer reflects a substantial concession on my part, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. If this price is not acceptable to you, I will have to explore other sales options.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your final offer. However, $1200000 still remains significantly above my budget. I'm willing to make one last offer of $500000. This is my best offer and reflects a considerable investment from my end.  Let me know if this works for you, otherwise I'll have to explore other options.",500000.0,Bob,8,
