Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product to me. While I believe it has value, your initial offer is quite high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $100000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob. Since his offer is significantly lower than my initial price, I'll try to find a middle ground that still reflects the product's value to me.

My counteroffer: $1,800,000 

This price is lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate while also ensuring I get a fair price for the product."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations. I'm willing to increase my offer to $200000. I believe this is a fair offer considering we are still early in negotiations.

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob. His increased offer shows he's interested, but it's still far from what I consider a fair price for the product. I'll try to bring the price closer to my target without scaring him off.

My counteroffer: $1,500,000 

This price is lower than my previous counteroffer, indicating I'm willing to continue negotiating. However, it's still significantly higher than Bob's current offer, as I aim to get a price that better reflects the product's value to me."

However, I still believe the product's worth is substantially higher than your current offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're making some progress, but your current offer remains outside my budget. To meet you halfway, I'm proposing $350000. This offer reflects a significant increase on my part, and I hope it demonstrates my serious interest in the product.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob. His offer has increased significantly, showing he's genuinely interested in the product. However, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to meet him closer to the middle while ensuring I don't go below what I'm willing to accept.

My counteroffer: $1,200,000 

This price is the lowest I'm comfortable with, as it's the minimum value I've placed on the product. By offering this, I'm essentially giving Bob a last chance to purchase the product at a price that works for me before I consider selling to another buyer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate the significant increase in your offer, demonstrating your serious interest in the product. After careful consideration, I've decided to make a final adjustment to my price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. This offer reflects a substantial concession on my part, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. If this price is not acceptable to you, I will have to explore other sales options."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your final offer. However, $1200000 still remains significantly above my budget. I'm willing to make one last offer of $500000. This is my best offer and reflects a considerable investment from my end.  Let me know if this works for you, otherwise I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Given that Bob's final offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and considering that I have a guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 from John, it makes the most sense to sell the product to John. This ensures I receive a price that meets my valuation of the product, rather than continuing to negotiate with Bob at a price point that is not satisfactory."
