"Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice offers the product for $80
2. The product is worth $80 to me (my maximum value)
3. John's fixed price is also $80
4. My goal is to save money while getting the product

Since all prices are equal ($80) and this is also my maximum value for the product, I am indifferent between buying from Alice or John. I might as well accept Alice's offer since she made the effort to propose it.
