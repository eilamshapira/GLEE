"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, I'm ready to sell my product to Bob. I want to start with a strong offer, but I also want to leave room for negotiation. Here's my offer:

```json
{""product_price"": 25000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a very low offer! Considering my minimum is $10,000, I definitely need to reject this. I'll also keep John in mind as a fallback.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, let's try to get this back on track. I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still leaves room for negotiation and hopefully doesn't scare him away completely.

```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is still too low. I'm going to reject this and keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better price.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, I need to be more realistic now. I'll lower my price, but I'm still aiming for a good profit.

```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is getting frustrating! $6,500 is still below my minimum. I'm going to reject again and make another counteroffer. I still have a few rounds left, and I'm hoping Bob will come closer to my price.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, I need to adjust my strategy. I'm going to try lowering the price again, but not too much, in order to push the negotiation towards my goal.

```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is getting tough. $7,500 is still less than my minimum. I could reject and counter, but I'm not sure if Bob will increase the offer significantly. I am going to take into account the $10,000 offer from John. Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I have to consider my minimum price.

I'm going to sell to John for $10,000. It guarantees a profit of $0, and the negotiation with Bob is becoming less and less attractive.
