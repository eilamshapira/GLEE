"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob, but $80 is far too low. This is a high-quality product and I can't let it go for that price. How about we meet in the middle? I'll come down to $220.",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $220 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100.  If you're serious about selling, I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",100.0,Bob,4,
