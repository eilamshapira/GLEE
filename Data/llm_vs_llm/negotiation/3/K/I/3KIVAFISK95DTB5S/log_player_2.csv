Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product which I understand would be valuable for your needs. Given the quality and market value of this product, I'm offering it to you for $950000. This represents a fair price considering the $1000000 value you'll receive from it. I'm open to discussing this offer, but I do have another interested buyer ready to purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I value the product at $1,000,000 and Alice is offering it for $950,000. This is a reasonable price.
