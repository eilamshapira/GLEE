"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Looking at the options, Alice is offering the product for $100, which is $50 less than John's price of $150. Since the product is worth up to $150 to me, and Alice's offer is below that threshold, it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer and save $50.
