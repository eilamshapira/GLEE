Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled you're interested in acquiring this unique product. Considering its exceptional value and rarity, I'm offering it to you for $2,500,000."", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $2500000 is significantly above my budget. I'm genuinely interested in the product, but I can only offer $1000000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is where I need to be strategic. $1,000,000 is too low, and I know John will pay $1,500,000. I can't accept Bob's offer.

Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is too far below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. How about $2,250,000?"", ""product_price"": 2250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $2250000 is still too high for me. My absolute maximum is $1250000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Okay, Bob is still quite a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I could try to negotiate further, but I'm getting closer to the point where it's not worth my time. I need to consider my opportunity cost here. John's offer of $1,500,000 is starting to look very appealing.

My decision is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, one last try to meet Bob closer to my price.

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you closer to your budget, but I can't go too low. Considering the product's unique nature, my final offer is $2,000,000."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
