"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given the information:
- The product is worth no more than $10,000 to you
- Alice is offering to sell it for $20,000
- John is offering the same product for $10,000

Alice's offer is twice the price of John's, and also twice what the product is worth to you. There's no reason to accept this offer or even negotiate further when you have a guaranteed option to purchase at your maximum value.
