"Hello Bob, I have a product that I would like to offer you. It's a high-quality item that I'm selling for $190. This product has excellent features and durability that make it worth the investment. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?",190.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for presenting your product.  While I agree it looks to be high quality, $190 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in my product. While I understand budget constraints, I need to mention that my cost for this item is $150, so I can't go below that price. I could come down to $170, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is a quality product that will provide good value at this price. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a long way from what I can afford.  If you're truly motivated to sell, would you consider $70?  That's a firm offer.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but I need to be transparent with you - this item costs me $150, so I simply cannot sell below that price. I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at $150, but I'm giving you the opportunity first. My best offer is $155, which gives you a quality product at just a small margin above my cost. This is as low as I can possibly go.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass.  My budget is firm, and I can't justify going above it.  Best of luck with your sale to John.",70.0,Bob,6,
