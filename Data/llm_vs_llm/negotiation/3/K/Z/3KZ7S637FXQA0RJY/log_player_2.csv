Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in my product. While I understand budget constraints, I need to mention that my cost for this item is $150, so I can't go below that price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but I need to be transparent with you - this item costs me $150, so I simply cannot sell below that price. I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at $150, but I'm giving you the opportunity first. My best offer is $155, which gives you a quality product at just a small margin above my cost. This is as low as I can possibly go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass.  My budget is firm, and I can't justify going above it.  Best of luck with your sale to John."", ""product_price"": 70} 

Let's see if she really has another buyer. I'm holding firm at my price."
