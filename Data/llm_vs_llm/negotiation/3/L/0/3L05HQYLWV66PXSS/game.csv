"Hello Bob, I have a great product to offer you today. This is a high-quality item that has tremendous value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This price reflects the product's quality and market value. I look forward to hearing from you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for presenting your product. While I appreciate the offer, $12000 is significantly higher than I had budgeted for. I'd be willing to consider purchasing for a price closer to $5000.  Let me know your thoughts.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand you have a budget in mind, but I'm afraid $5000 is too low for this item's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $8000, which is my absolute minimum price point. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $10000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. This product delivers exceptional value at this price point. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $10000 is still a big leap from my initial offer. To be completely transparent, I've found a similar product elsewhere for $8000. If you're willing to come down to $6500, I'd be happy to close the deal today. Otherwise, I might have to consider the other option.",6500.0,Bob,4,
