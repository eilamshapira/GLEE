"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12000. I believe it will provide great value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's fixed price ($8,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. While I could make a counteroffer, I already know that John is willing to sell at $8,000, which is exactly my maximum value. Since Alice's initial offer is so high ($12,000) and the product is worth $15,000 to her, it's unlikely we'll reach a price below $8,000. Therefore, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
