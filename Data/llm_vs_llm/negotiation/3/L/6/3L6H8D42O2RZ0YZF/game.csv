"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to lower the price. However, $11000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to come up from my previous offer, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we settle at $8500?",8500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid $10000 is still a bit too high for me. Since this is the last round, I'll make one final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options. I'm willing to pay $8000, which is the highest I can go.",8000.0,Bob,10,
