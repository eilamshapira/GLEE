"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $10000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The offer from Alice is $10,000, which is higher than both the $8,000 that the product is worth to me and the $8,000 that John is offering. Since Alice's price exceeds the maximum I'm willing to pay, it doesn't make sense to accept her offer.

I could reject and make a counteroffer, but John is already offering the product at exactly my maximum valuation of $8,000. There's no guarantee Alice would accept a counteroffer below $8,000, and continuing negotiations takes time and effort.

The rational decision is to go with the guaranteed fair price.
