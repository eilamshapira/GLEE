"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, the value of the product is significant, and I cannot go as low as $850000. How about we meet in the middle with a price of $1000000? I believe this reflects the value of the product well. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I understand the value of the product, $1000000 is still a bit much for my budget. How about we settle at $925000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",925000.0,Bob,4,
