"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $9500. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product that meets your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","It looks like Alice is offering the product for $9,500, which is more than the $8,000 it's worth to you and more than John's price of $8,000.

Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to you
2. Alice is offering it for $9,500
3. John is willing to sell it for $8,000

The rational decision would be to not accept Alice's offer and instead buy from John at the lower price.
