"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below my maximum budget of $1,500,000, I am inclined to save more money. However, the offer is already quite low, and I risk Alice not being willing to go lower if I reject this offer. Considering the potential for further negotiation, I'll choose to reject the offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can get an even better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, to try to save even more money. Since Alice's offer was $1,200,000, I'll offer $1,000,000 to see how she responds.
