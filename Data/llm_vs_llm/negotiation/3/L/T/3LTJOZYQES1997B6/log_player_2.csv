"Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll analyze this situation:

The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me (Bob).
Alice is offering to sell it for $3,000,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum value.
John is offering the same product for $1,200,000, which matches my maximum value.

Since Alice's offer ($3,000,000) far exceeds both my maximum value and John's alternative price, it doesn't make sense to accept it. I could make a counteroffer to Alice, but since John is already offering the product at my maximum acceptable price, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice unless I believe I can get it for less than $1,200,000.
