"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this strategically:

1. My maximum value for the product is $120
2. Alice's offer is $100, which is $20 less than John's price
3. The product is worth $80 to Alice, so there might be room for negotiation
4. If I reject and make a counteroffer, I might get an even better deal
5. I have John's offer as a backup, so there's no risk in negotiating

Given these factors, I should reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price with Alice. Even if the negotiation fails, I can still buy from John at $120.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $80 to Alice and she offered $100, I'll try to meet closer to the middle. I'll offer $90, which gives Alice a $10 profit while saving me $30 compared to John's price. This is a reasonable counteroffer that leaves room for further negotiation if needed.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has moved down from $100 to $95, showing willingness to negotiate
2. The new price is $25 less than John's price
3. We've now arrived at a price that's a reasonable middle ground:
   - Alice makes $15 profit (from her $80 cost)
   - I save $25 (compared to John's $120)
4. Further negotiation might only yield minimal improvements
5. There's a risk that prolonged negotiation could make Alice less cooperative

Given that we've reached a fair compromise and the savings are already substantial, I'll accept this offer.
