"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $20000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Reasoning: Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000. Since John is offering the exact same product for $8,000, which matches my maximum acceptable price, it's most logical to buy from John. Even if I tried to negotiate with Alice, starting from $20,000 is too far from my target price, and there's no guarantee we would reach an acceptable price. Taking John's offer is the most efficient and guaranteed way to get the product within my budget."
