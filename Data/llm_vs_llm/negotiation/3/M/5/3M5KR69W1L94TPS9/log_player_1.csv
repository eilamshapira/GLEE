Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to choose a price that maximizes my profit while ensuring Bob is likely to accept.

The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, so he would be willing to pay up to that amount. However, if I price it too high, he might reject the offer, and I would have to sell to John for $10,000.

If Bob rejects my offer, I get $10,000. Therefore, I should offer Bob a price that makes it worthwhile for him to accept while giving me more than $10,000.

Since Bob values the product at $12,000, I could offer him a price slightly below that, giving him some incentive to accept while maximizing my profit.
