"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $2500000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations.",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is significantly above my budget and the market value for similar products. I've done my research, and I believe a more reasonable price would be $900000. This is a fair offer that reflects the current market conditions. I'm willing to discuss this further.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the time you've taken to research the market value of the product. However, I must say that $900000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. Considering the product's unique features and its value to me, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you a price of $2200000, which is lower than my initial offer but still reflects the product's worth. I'm open to further discussions and finding a mutually agreeable price.",2200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice, but $2200000 is still well above what I can justify spending. While I can increase my previous offer, I need to stay within a reasonable range. Based on my budget and market research, I can offer $1100000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my serious interest in making this deal work.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price and find a mutually agreeable deal. However, $1100000 is still lower than I'm willing to accept. Considering the product's value and the fact that you've shown serious interest in making this deal work, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you a price of $2000000, which is lower than my previous offers but still reflects the product's worth. I'm open to further discussions and finding a price that works for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,5,
