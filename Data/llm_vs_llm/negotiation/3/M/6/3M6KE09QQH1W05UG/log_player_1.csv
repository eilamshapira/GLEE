"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $2,500,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is significantly above my budget and the market value for similar products. I've done my research, and I believe a more reasonable price would be $900000. This is a fair offer that reflects the current market conditions. I'm willing to discuss this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and even lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to send a counteroffer. I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I can try to get a better price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the time you've taken to research the market value of the product. However, I must say that $900,000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. Considering the product's unique features and its value to me, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you a price of $2,200,000, which is lower than my initial offer but still reflects the product's worth. I'm open to further discussions and finding a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 2200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice, but $2200000 is still well above what I can justify spending. While I can increase my previous offer, I need to stay within a reasonable range. Based on my budget and market research, I can offer $1100000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my serious interest in making this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Although Bob has increased his offer to $1,100,000, it's still lower than what John is willing to pay. I believe I can try to get a better price from Bob, so I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to send a counteroffer. Since Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, I'm hopeful that we can continue to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price that is closer to the product's value to me."

I can offer you a price of $2,000,000, which is lower than my previous offers but still reflects the product's worth.
