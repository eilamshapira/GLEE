"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2000000. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm open to negotiations if you're interested.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000, considering the product's value and my own financial constraints.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000, considering its exceptional value and the fact that I have another buyer willing to pay a substantial amount. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe this price is more in line with the product's worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you have another buyer interested, but I'm still not comfortable with a price as high as $1800000. I'd like to make a revised counteroffer of $750000, which is closer to my budget and takes into account the product's value. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price as low as $750000. Considering the product's value and the fact that I have another buyer willing to pay $1000000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate the reduction in price, but $1500000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I'd like to make a revised counteroffer of $900000. This is the highest price I'm comfortable paying, considering I have another option to buy the product from John for $800000.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your revised counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price as low as $900000, considering John is willing to pay $1000000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're not comfortable with this price, I will have to sell the product to John.",950000.0,Alice,7,
