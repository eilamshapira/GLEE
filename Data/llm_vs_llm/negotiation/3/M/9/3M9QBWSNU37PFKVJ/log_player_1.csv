Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000, considering the product's value and my own financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and also lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you have another buyer interested, but I'm still not comfortable with a price as high as $1800000. I'd like to make a revised counteroffer of $750000, which is closer to my budget and takes into account the product's value. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.

Since Bob's revised offer of $750,000 is still lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to accept an offer that's lower than John's."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate the reduction in price, but $1500000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I'd like to make a revised counteroffer of $900000. This is the highest price I'm comfortable paying, considering I have another option to buy the product from John for $800000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Although Bob's revised offer of $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still lower than what John is willing to pay. Since I have a guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 from John, I will reject Bob's offer and not make another counteroffer. Instead, I will sell the product to John for the higher price. 

However, I made a mistake I will correct that now 

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","No, I chose to sell the product to John, but I made a mistake earlier and said I would make a counteroffer to Bob instead. To correct that, I will reiterate that I want to sell the product to John, not make a counteroffer to Bob.

However, if I were to make a counteroffer to Bob, it would be:

{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price as low as $900,000, considering John is willing to pay $1,000,000.

If you're not comfortable with this price, I will have to sell the product to John."", ""product_price"": 950000}

But again, I want to emphasize that my original intention was to sell the product to John, not make another counteroffer to Bob."
