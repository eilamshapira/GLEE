"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be a great fit for your needs. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2300000. This price reflects the product's superior features and potential value. Would you be interested in proceeding with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The price Alice is offering ($2,300,000) is significantly higher than both:
1. My maximum value for the product ($800,000)
2. John's guaranteed offer ($800,000)

Since Alice's initial offer is nearly three times higher than my maximum value, and exactly $1.5 million more than John's offer, it makes the most economic sense to buy from John immediately rather than enter into a negotiation with Alice. Even if Alice were to reduce her price significantly in subsequent rounds, it's unlikely she would match or beat John's price given her high initial offer."
