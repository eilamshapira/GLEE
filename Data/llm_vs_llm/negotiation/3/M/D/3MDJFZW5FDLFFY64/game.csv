"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is way over my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $6000 for it. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that budgets can be tight, but I truly believe the value this product offers exceeds $6000. How about we settle at $12000? I think this is a fair middle ground considering the product's capabilities and benefits.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $12000 is still too high for me. My maximum budget for this product is $7000. I'm willing to increase my offer to that amount. What do you say?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I really can't go below $10000 as that's the minimum price I'd consider. If you can meet me at $10000, I believe you'll find that the product's value justifies the cost.",10000.0,Alice,5,
