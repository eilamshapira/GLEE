"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm ready to discuss the sale. I'm offering the product for $2000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer ($2,000,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), the best decision is to buy from John. There's no reason to negotiate further when Alice's initial offer is double what I can get elsewhere.
