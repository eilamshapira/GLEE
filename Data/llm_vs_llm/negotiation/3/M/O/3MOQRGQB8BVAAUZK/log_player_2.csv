"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice is offering the product at $1,200,000, which is $300,000 less than John's price of $1,500,000. This is a good offer since it's well below my maximum valuation, but I might be able to negotiate an even better price with Alice.

If I reject and make a counteroffer, there's potential to save even more money. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, she has room to go lower than her current offer.

There's no reason to buy from John at this point since Alice's offer is already better.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that gives Alice some profit while still trying to save more money for myself.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her price from $1,200,000 to $1,150,000, which is a $50,000 improvement. This is moving in the right direction. At $1,150,000, Alice would make a $150,000 profit over her valuation of $1,000,000.

I could accept this offer, which would save me $350,000 compared to John's price. However, there might still be room to negotiate further since Alice has shown willingness to reduce her price.

I'll reject this offer and make one more counteroffer to see if we can meet closer to the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer to show that I'm willing to compromise, but still try to get a better price than Alice's current offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,140,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,140,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has now lowered her price from $1,150,000 to $1,140,000, which is another $10,000 reduction. We're making progress in the negotiation, but the increments are getting smaller. 

At $1,140,000, I would save $360,000 compared to John's price, which is a substantial savings. Alice would still make a $140,000 profit over her valuation.

While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might grow frustrated and stop moving her price lower. The current offer is quite reasonable, saving me 24% compared to my alternative option.

I'll accept this offer as it represents a good balance between saving money and concluding the negotiation successfully.
