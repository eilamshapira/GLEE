"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20000 is far beyond my budget. I value the product at $5000. Would you be willing to sell it for that price?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5000 is significantly below the product's value and less than what I paid for it. Given the quality and features of this product, I couldn't go below $17500. This is still a competitive price considering what similar products sell for in the market. Would you be able to meet me at this price?",17500.0,Alice,3,
