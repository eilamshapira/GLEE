Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on its exceptional features and market value, I'm pricing it at $20,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20000 is far beyond my budget. I value the product at $5000. Would you be willing to sell it for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is significantly below the product's value and less than what I paid for it.
