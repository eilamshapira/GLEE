Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on its exceptional features and market value, I'm pricing it at $20000. This product has proven to be very valuable for its owners. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is far beyond my budget. I value the product at $5,000. Would you be willing to sell it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5000 is significantly below the product's value and less than what I paid for it. Given the quality and features of this product, I couldn't go below $17500. This is still a competitive price considering what similar products sell for in the market. Would you be able to meet me at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's offer of $17,500 is still too high. My maximum value is $10,000, and John is offering the product for that price.
