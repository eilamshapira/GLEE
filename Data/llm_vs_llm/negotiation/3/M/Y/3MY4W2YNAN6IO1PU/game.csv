,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12500? It's still a great deal considering the value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but the gap between our prices is still pretty wide. To be honest, I'm considering other options closer to $10000.  Would $10500 be agreeable to you?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $11500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've invested in this negotiation.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation. I'm getting closer to my limit, but $11500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you consider $10800? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making a deal.",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your willingness to compromise.  I'm also committed to making a deal. How about $11200?  It's a reasonable middle ground and a fair price for both of us.",11200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting so close! I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  How about we split the difference - $11000 and we have a deal? ",11000.0,Bob,8,
