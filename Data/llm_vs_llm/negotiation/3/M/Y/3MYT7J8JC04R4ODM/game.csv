"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $10000 at this time. Let me know if you're open to discussing that price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $10000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. How about we meet in the middle at $15000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $15000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $12000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $12000 is a more reasonable price, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. It's still a discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Would you be willing to meet me at $14000?",14000.0,Alice,5,
