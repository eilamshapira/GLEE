Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $10000 at this time. Let me know if you're open to discussing that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the minimum value the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for the same price, I don't see a benefit in accepting Bob's offer over selling to John. However, I also don't want to give up on the potential of getting a higher price from Bob. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $15000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $12000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's new offer of $12,000 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and it's also closer to my initial offer. Considering that I don't know Bob's maximum budget and he's willing to negotiate, I'll reject his offer again and try to get a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $12,000 is a more reasonable price, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. It's still a discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Would you be willing to meet me at $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
