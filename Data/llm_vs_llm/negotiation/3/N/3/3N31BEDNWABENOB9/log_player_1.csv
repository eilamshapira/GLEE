Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze this situation strategically. Since I know I have a guaranteed $10,000 from John if Bob rejects my offer, I should offer Bob a higher price. Given that I don't know Bob's maximum valuation, I should set a price that gives me a good chance of capturing higher value while still having my $10,000 fallback.
