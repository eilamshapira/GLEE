"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to carefully consider my options:

Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is exactly my maximum valuation.

John is also willing to sell the product for $15,000.

Since both offers are identical at $15,000, I'm indifferent between them from a purely financial perspective. There's no monetary advantage to choosing one over the other.
