"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to consider if accepting Alice's offer makes sense given my constraints.

Alice is offering the product for $130, but the product is only worth up to $100 to me. John is willing to sell me the same product for $100, which matches exactly what I value it at.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and John's price is $30 less than Alice's offer, the logical choice is to buy from John.
