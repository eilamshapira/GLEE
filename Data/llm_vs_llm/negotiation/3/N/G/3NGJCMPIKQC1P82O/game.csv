"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair price for such a great product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I understand where you're coming from, but $125 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
