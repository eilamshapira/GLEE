"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I know the market value of similar products, and I can actually get it from another seller for $8000. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. Would you consider selling it for $6000?",6000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,12000.0
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $6000 is too low for me. Based on the product's unique qualities, I can't go below $12000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering its value.",12000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $12000 is still more than I can justify spending. I have a firm budget constraint, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $7000, which is more than my initial offer and would save you the trouble of finding another buyer.",7000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,11000.0
"Bob, I understand your budget. However, considering the product's uniqueness and the fact that it's worth at least $10000 to me, I can't go as low as $7000. To meet you in the middle, I'm willing to offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit.",11000.0,Alice,5,,
