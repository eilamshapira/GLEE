Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15,000."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I know the market value of similar products, and I can actually get it from another seller for $8000. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. Would you consider selling it for $6000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough one. Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum and lower than selling to John. However, rejecting it means potentially missing out on a higher price later. Here's my thinking:

*   Bob is trying to lowball me significantly.
*   I know the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, so $6,000 is a loss.
*   Selling to John nets me $10,000 immediately.

Given the initial lowball offer, I'm going to try and push for more, but I'll also set a mental floor.

Therefore:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer_price"": 12000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $6,000 is too low for me. Based on the product's unique qualities, I can't go below $12,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $12000 is still more than I can justify spending. I have a firm budget constraint, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer $7000, which is more than my initial offer and would save you the trouble of finding another buyer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Okay, Bob is still lowballing, but he's moving closer to my minimum. He's also emphasizing his budget constraint.

Here's my thinking:

*   $7,000 is still a loss for me, even though I'm saving time.
*   I know my minimum value is $10,000.
*   Bob said he can get it elsewhere for $8,000, but he prefers to work with me.
*   I have a good chance that I can still get more than $10,000, and I think Bob will be willing to pay it.

Therefore:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget. However, considering the product's uniqueness and the fact that it's worth at least $10,000 to me, I can't go as low as $7,000. To meet you in the middle, I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
