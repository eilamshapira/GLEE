"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $2000000. If this offer doesn’t work for you, no worries—I have another buyer ready at $1500000. Let me know your decision at your earliest convenience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $2,000,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. Additionally, Alice mentioned that she has another buyer ready at $1,500,000, but that doesn't change my decision because I already have the option to buy from John at that price.
