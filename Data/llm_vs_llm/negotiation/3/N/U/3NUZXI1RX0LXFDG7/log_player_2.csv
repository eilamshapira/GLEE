{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but we can try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

This is a strong counteroffer that still leaves room for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her own valuation of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  Let's see if we can get closer to our target price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 880000} 
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between our previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It demonstrates our commitment to reaching an agreement, while still keeping the price below our $900,000 target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to our target price. While it's still slightly higher than we'd ideally like, it's a good deal considering John's price. We've also used a few rounds of negotiation to establish a pattern, so it's likely Alice won't be willing to go much lower."
