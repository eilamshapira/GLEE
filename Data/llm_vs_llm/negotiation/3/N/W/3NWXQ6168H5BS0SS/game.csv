"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is above my budget for this product. I know the market value, and I can actually get it from another seller for $150. However, I'd like to work with you. I can offer $130, which would still give you a reasonable return. Would you consider this price?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $130 is below my minimum acceptable price. I understand you mentioned you can get it for $150 elsewhere. Given that, I'm willing to match that price at $150, which is fair for both of us. Would you accept this offer?",150.0,Alice,3,
