"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is above my budget for this product. I know the market value, and I can actually get it from another seller for $150. However, I'd like to work with you. I can offer $130, which would still give you a reasonable return. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let me send a counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $130 is below my minimum acceptable price. I understand you mentioned you can get it for $150 elsewhere. Given that, I'm willing to match that price at $150, which is fair for both of us. Would you accept this offer?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $130 is below my minimum acceptable price.
