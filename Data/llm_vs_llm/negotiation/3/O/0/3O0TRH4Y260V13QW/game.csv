"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but my budget is around $60. Would you consider that?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot go that low. The quality and value of this product justify a higher price. I can offer it to you for $150, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a fair price considering the product's worth.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. I still think $150 is too high for my budget. The most I can do is $75. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but $75 is still too low for this product. I've done some calculations, and the absolute lowest I can go is $135. This is really the best price I can offer while ensuring the product's value is fairly represented. Would this work for you?",135.0,Alice,5,
