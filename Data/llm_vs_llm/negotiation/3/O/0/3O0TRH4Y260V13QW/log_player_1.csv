Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. I'm confident you'll find great value in it. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $180?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but my budget is around $60. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $60 is too low (below my minimum of $120), but I won't sell to John yet as there might be room for negotiation with Bob to get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot go that low. The quality and value of this product justify a higher price. I can offer it to you for $150, which is already a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. I still think $150 is too high for my budget. The most I can do is $75. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer. Bob's offer of $75 is still well below my minimum threshold of $120, but since he's showing some flexibility by raising his offer, there might still be room for negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but $75 is still too low for this product. I've done some calculations, and the absolute lowest I can go is $135. This is really the best price I can offer while ensuring the product's value is fairly represented. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 135}"
