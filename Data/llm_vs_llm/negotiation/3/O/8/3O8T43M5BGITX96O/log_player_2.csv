"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $15000 for it. It's a fair price, considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice is offering the product for $15,000, but I know the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me. John is willing to sell the same product for $12,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

While I could try negotiating with Alice by making a counteroffer, there's no guarantee she'll accept a price below $12,000. Since I already have a guaranteed option to buy from John at my maximum value, it makes the most sense to take that option.
