"Hi Bob, I'm offering my premium product to you for $1200000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value and quality it brings. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the premium quality of your product, $1200000 is beyond my budget. I have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $1000000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better deal. I'm willing to offer $800000 for your product. This gives you a quick sale and saves me from having to negotiate with John. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, given your budget constraints and my minimum price consideration, let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. This way, we both make a compromise, and you still get the product from your preferred seller. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
