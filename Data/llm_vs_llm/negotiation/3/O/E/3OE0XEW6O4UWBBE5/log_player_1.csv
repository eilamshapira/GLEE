"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the premium quality of your product, $1200000 is beyond my budget. I have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $1000000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better deal. I'm willing to offer $800000 for your product. This gives you a quick sale and saves me from having to negotiate with John. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
