"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my premium product to you for $1200000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value and quality it brings. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Based on the offer from Alice, I can see that she is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is more than the $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me. John is offering to sell the product for exactly $1,000,000.

Since Alice's offer exceeds the maximum value I'm willing to pay and is also higher than John's alternative offer, it makes the most sense to reject Alice's offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the premium quality of your product, $1,200,000 is beyond my budget. I have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $1,000,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better deal. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for your product. This gives you a quick sale and saves me from having to negotiate with John. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, given your budget constraints and my minimum price consideration, let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. This way, we both make a compromise, and you still get the product from your preferred seller. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll analyze this offer carefully. Alice is now offering the product for $900,000, which is:
- $100,000 less than John's price of $1,000,000
- Well below my maximum value of $1,000,000

This is a good deal that allows me to save $100,000 compared to buying from John. Since the offer is below my maximum valuation and represents significant savings, I should accept this offer.
