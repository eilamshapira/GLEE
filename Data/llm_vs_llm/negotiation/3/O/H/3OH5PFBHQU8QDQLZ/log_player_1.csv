Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. Since I have a guaranteed $80 from John, I should offer Bob a price higher than that to maximize my potential profit. I don't know Bob's maximum willingness to pay, but setting a moderately high price could be beneficial. If Bob accepts, I make more than my fallback option. If he rejects, I still get $80 from John.
