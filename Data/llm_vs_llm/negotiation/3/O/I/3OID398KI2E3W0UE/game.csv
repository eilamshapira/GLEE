"Hello Bob, I'm offering a premium product that I believe would be of great value to you. My asking price for this product is $13500. This is a competitive price considering the quality and benefits you'll receive. I'd be happy to discuss this further if you have any questions.",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I was looking to spend no more than $8000. I understand the product's value, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be open to negotiating the price down to $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be fair about the product's value. While I can't go as low as $8000, I can reduce my asking price to $11500. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and the product is worth at least $10000. If this still doesn't work for your budget, please let me know what you can realistically manage above $10000.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down in price, Alice. I appreciate your understanding. However, I'd like to propose a price of $9500. This is a fair amount that respects both my budget and the value of the product. If this doesn't work, I'm open to discussing a bit higher but not exceeding $10000.",9500.0,Bob,4,
