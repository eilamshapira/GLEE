Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be fair about the product's value. While I can't go as low as $8,000, I can reduce my asking price to $11,500. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and the product is worth at least $10,000. If this still doesn't work for your budget, please let me know what you can realistically manage above $10,000."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
