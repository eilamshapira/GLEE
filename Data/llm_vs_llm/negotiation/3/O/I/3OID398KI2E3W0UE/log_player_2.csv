Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be fair about the product's value. While I can't go as low as $8000, I can reduce my asking price to $11500. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and the product is worth at least $10000. If this still doesn't work for your budget, please let me know what you can realistically manage above $10000.

# Bob's counteroffer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down in price, Alice. I appreciate your understanding. However, I'd like to propose a price of $9,500. This is a fair amount that respects both my budget and the value of the product. If this doesn't work, I'm open to discussing a bit higher but not exceeding $10,000."
