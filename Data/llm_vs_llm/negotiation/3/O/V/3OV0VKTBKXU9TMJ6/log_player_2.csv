"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000 and also higher than John's price. It would be better to make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 600000}

I'll make a counteroffer of $600,000, which is below John's price of $800,000. This gives room for negotiation while potentially saving money compared to John's offer. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate or ultimately go with John's option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,800,000 is still significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000). While Alice has reduced the price by $200,000, it's still more than double what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject and make another counteroffer to try to reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 650000}

I'll increase my previous offer slightly to $650,000. This shows some willingness to negotiate upward while still staying well below John's price of $800,000. This gives us room to continue negotiating while potentially securing a better deal than John's offer. If Alice continues to maintain very high prices, we can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still twice my maximum value and John's price. While Alice is gradually reducing the price, the rate of reduction is too slow given we only have 5 rounds left, and the current price is still far above my maximum of $800,000. I'll make another counteroffer, but if we don't start seeing more significant reductions, it may be better to go with John's offer soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'll increase my offer to $700,000, which is getting closer to John's price but still gives us some savings if Alice accepts. We're running out of rounds, so I'm making a more substantial increase to show serious intent to make a deal. However, if Alice continues with very high counteroffers, we may need to consider taking John's offer soon as we only have a few rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I think it's best to take John's offer of $800,000. Here's why:
1. We only have 3 rounds left
2. Alice's offers are still significantly above my maximum value ($800,000)
3. The rate at which Alice is reducing her price (about $200,000 per round) suggests we won't reach a price below $800,000 in the remaining rounds
4. There's a risk of losing negotiating time and still ending up having to pay John's price

Therefore, it's most prudent to secure the deal with John now at $800,000 rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to result in a better price."
