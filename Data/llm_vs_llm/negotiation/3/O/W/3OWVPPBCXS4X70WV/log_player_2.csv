"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll analyze this situation. The product is worth up to $150 to me, and Alice's offer is $140. John is willing to sell for $150.

Alice's offer ($140) is already $10 less than John's price ($150), so it's better than my outside option. However, since the product is only worth $100 to Alice, there's potential to negotiate a better deal. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that leaves room for negotiation but is still reasonable given the product's value to Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I can see that Alice has moved down from her initial offer of $140 to $130, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is already $20 better than John's price of $150. However, since the product is worth $100 to Alice, there's still room for negotiation to reach a price that's better for me while still profitable for her.
