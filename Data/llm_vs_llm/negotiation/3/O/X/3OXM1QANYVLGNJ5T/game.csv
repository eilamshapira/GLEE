"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and the benefits it brings, I'm initially asking $14000. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the product, but $14000 is a bit steep for me. Looking at similar products on the market and considering the features, I'd be comfortable paying $9500 for it. This represents a fair profit margin for you while still being reasonable for my budget. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $9500 is lower than I'm comfortable with, given the product's unique value and the investment I've made. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $12500.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for working with me, Alice. I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still finding $12500 a bit high for my budget. Since we're trying to meet in the middle, I can offer $10800. This gives you a solid profit while still fitting within my constraints. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?",10800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to my floor here. Given the unique aspects of this product, I'm comfortable going down to $11900. This is really as low as I can go. What do you think?",11900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. Your offer of $11900 is getting closer to what I had in mind. I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm trying to be reasonable as well. Let's settle at $11200, which I think represents a fair deal for both of us. This is very close to your asking price and gives me the budget room I need. Do we have a deal?",11200.0,Bob,6,
