"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and the benefits it brings, I'm initially asking $14000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given Alice's offer of $14,000, I should evaluate my options:

1. The product is worth up to $15,000 to me
2. Alice values it at $8,000
3. John is selling it for $15,000

Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than my maximum valuation ($15,000) and less than John's price, but there's likely room to negotiate since Alice values it much lower at $8,000.

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This will allow me to potentially get a better price than $14,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $9500 is lower than I'm comfortable with, given the product's unique value and the investment I've made. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $12500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down from $14,000 to $12,500, which is a good sign that she's willing to negotiate. Her counteroffer is still well below my maximum valuation of $15,000 and below John's price of $15,000. However, since Alice values the product at $8,000, there's still room for further negotiation to get a better price.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer to try to bring the price down further.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for working with me, Alice. I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still finding $12,500 a bit high for my budget. Since we're trying to meet in the middle, I can offer $10,800. This gives you a solid profit while still fitting within my constraints. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to my floor here. Given the unique aspects of this product, I'm comfortable going down to $11900. This is really as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $11,900 from $12,500, claiming this is ""really as low as I can go."" However, this is still significantly above her valuation of $8,000, so she has room to go lower. 

At $11,900, this is still $3,100 below my maximum valuation and $3,100 below John's price, which makes it a decent offer. However, I think there's still room for one more round of negotiation to try to get a slightly better price.

I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm trying to be reasonable as well. Let's settle at $11,200, which I think represents a fair deal for both of us. This is very close to your asking price and gives me the budget room I need. Do we have a deal?"", ""product_price"": 11200}"
