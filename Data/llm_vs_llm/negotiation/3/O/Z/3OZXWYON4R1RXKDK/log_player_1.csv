"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer for Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Considering the situation, my options are:

*   **Option 1: Accept Bob's offer** - This is clearly unacceptable, as the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and this offer is far below that.
*   **Option 2: Reject Bob's offer and counteroffer** - This is the most likely route I'll take.
*   **Option 3: Sell to John** - This is tempting, but I can try to get a better deal with Bob.

Therefore, I choose to:

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","I am still holding firm.

*   **Option 1: Accept Bob's offer** - This is a bad deal.
*   **Option 2: Reject Bob's offer and counteroffer** - Still a good option to try.
*   **Option 3: Sell to John** - A safer option, but still not my ideal.

Therefore, I choose to:

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is getting closer to the point where I need to make a decision.

*   **Option 1: Accept Bob's offer** - Still below my minimum.
*   **Option 2: Reject Bob's offer and counteroffer** - Risky, but there's still a chance.
*   **Option 3: Sell to John** - This is looking better now.

Given the offers and the remaining rounds, it's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed profit.
