"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its exceptional quality and value, I'm starting with a competitive price. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks great, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $50 for it. Let me know what you think.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $50 is significantly lower than I'm willing to sell for. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll lower my initial price, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the compromise.  However, $160 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're making progress, but $70 is still quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to continue compromising, but I need to get closer to a price that reflects the product's value. Let's try to meet in the middle.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $140 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I can go up to $75, but that's my final offer. If that doesn't work, I might need to consider other options.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $75 is still below what I'm willing to accept. Considering you mentioned it's your final offer, I'll make one more compromise. However, I need to prioritize getting a fair price for the product. I'll come down a bit more, but this is as low as I'm willing to go.",130.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the effort you're making to reach a deal. However, I'm afraid we're at an impasse.  I can't justify going higher than my last offer of $75.  I understand this might not be ideal for you, and I wish you all the best in finding another buyer.",75.0,Bob,8,
