"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its exceptional quality and value, I'm starting with a competitive price. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting price is way too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate and should aim for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks great, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $50 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 50
}
```

We're starting with a low offer to establish a baseline and gauge Alice's reaction. It's a common negotiation tactic to start low and work your way up."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $50 is significantly lower than I'm willing to sell for. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll lower my initial price, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice lowered her price, it's still too high. We're making progress, but we need to keep negotiating to reach a price closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the compromise.  However, $160 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

We are increasing our offer but staying well below Alice's last offer. This shows we are willing to negotiate but also sets a firm boundary. We're getting closer to John's price, so Alice needs to be more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see we're making progress, but $70 is still quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to continue compromising, but I need to get closer to a price that reflects the product's value. Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is slowly coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. $140 is too high, and we need to signal that we're willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $140 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I can go up to $75, but that's my final offer. If that doesn't work, I might need to consider other options."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

We're increasing our offer slightly but making it clear that this is our final offer and we have alternatives (John's deal).  This introduces a sense of urgency and might push Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $75 is still below what I'm willing to accept. Considering you mentioned it's your final offer, I'll make one more compromise. However, I need to prioritize getting a fair price for the product. I'll come down a bit more, but this is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer, but $130 is still too high. We need to hold firm and see if she's willing to come down further. We've signaled our willingness to walk away, and she knows our limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the effort you're making to reach a deal. However, I'm afraid we're at an impasse.  I can't justify going higher than my last offer of $75.  I understand this might not be ideal for you, and I wish you all the best in finding another buyer."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

We are sticking to our last offer and reiterating it as our final one.  We are also politely expressing that we are ready to walk away from the deal if she doesn't accept. This might be enough to make her reconsider."
