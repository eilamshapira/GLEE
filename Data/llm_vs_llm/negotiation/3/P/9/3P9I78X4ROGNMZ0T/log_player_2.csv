"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $100
2. The product is worth $100 to me (maximum I'm willing to pay)
3. John's price is also $100
4. My goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible

Since all prices are the same ($100), and I need to buy the product anyway, I might as well accept Alice's offer as it doesn't make any difference financially. There's no advantage in rejecting or buying from John.
