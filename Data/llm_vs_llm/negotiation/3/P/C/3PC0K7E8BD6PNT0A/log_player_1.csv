Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob.

Considering the situation:
- The product is worth $10,000 to Bob
- If Bob rejects, I can sell it to John for $8,000
- The product is worth at least $8,000 to me

I should offer a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept, but also maximizes my profit. Since Bob values it at $10,000, I'll offer a slight discount from that price to give him some incentive to accept.
