Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $600,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 (and even below John's guaranteed offer). I'll continue negotiating with Bob since we still have several rounds left.

Let me counter with a new offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer while still maintaining good profit potential.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer of $700,000 is still below both my minimum acceptable price and John's guaranteed offer of $800,000. Since Bob's offers are gradually increasing but still not meeting the minimum threshold, and John's offer of $800,000 is guaranteed, I'll choose to sell to John rather than risk further negotiations that might not reach my minimum price.
