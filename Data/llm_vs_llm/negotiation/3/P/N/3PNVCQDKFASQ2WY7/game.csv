,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8000, considering the market value and my budget. Looking forward to your response.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $8000 is lower than what I'm willing to accept. This product has unique qualities that justify a higher price. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $13500.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I need to stay within a reasonable range. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9500. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your seriousness. I'm willing to come down further. How about $12000? That's a significant reduction and a very fair price for the value you're receiving.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate the reduction to $12000, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. Considering the market and my budget, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10500. This is a competitive offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. $10500 is tempting, but I still believe the product is worth more. Let's try $11500. This is the lowest I am willing to go at this time.",11500.0,Alice,7,
