"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since the offered price of $2,000,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,200,000, it would be unreasonable to accept this offer. Additionally, buying from John for $1,200,000 is an option, but I would like to try to negotiate with Alice first to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. Therefore, the best course of action is to reject Alice's offer and proceed with making a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that my maximum budget is $1,200,000 and Alice's initial offer was $2,000,000, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still reasonable, considering I'm trying to save as much money as possible. A good starting point could be around half of Alice's offer, which would be $1,000,000. This gives room for negotiation while also being closer to my target budget.
