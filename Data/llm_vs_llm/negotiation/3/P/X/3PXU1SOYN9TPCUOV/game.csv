"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product that I believe would be valuable to you. Based on my understanding, this product is worth $150 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140, which would give you a $10 profit while allowing me to make more than my minimum. This is a fair deal that benefits both of us. If you accept, you'll get a product you value at $150 for less than that amount.",140.0,Alice,1,
