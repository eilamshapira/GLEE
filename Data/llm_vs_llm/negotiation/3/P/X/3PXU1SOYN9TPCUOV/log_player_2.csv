"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product that I believe would be valuable to you. Based on my understanding, this product is worth $150 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140, which would give you a $10 profit while allowing me to make more than my minimum. This is a fair deal that benefits both of us. If you accept, you'll get a product you value at $150 for less than that amount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
