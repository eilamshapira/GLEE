Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that the product is worth $100 to me and only $80 to Bob, I should probably make a reasonable first offer that's still above my minimum threshold.

{""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $60 is well below my minimum value of $100, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $100, there's no reason to accept Bob's low offer or continue negotiating. The best decision is to sell to John.
