"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm asking $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to analyze this offer carefully.

The product is worth no more than $80 to me. Alice is offering it for $110, which exceeds its value to me. 

If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy the same product from John for $80, which matches exactly the maximum value I place on the item.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and John's price ($80) is $30 less than Alice's price ($110), the rational decision is clear.
