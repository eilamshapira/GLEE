"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I'm looking to sell. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $12000. I believe this is a fair price for what you're getting.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but I think $12000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $6000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I can't go that low. The product is worth at least $10000 to me, and I already have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $10500, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price and represents good value for this product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I still find the price a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $7000.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but I need to be transparent with you. I have John ready to purchase this product for $10000, which is my absolute minimum acceptable price given what the product is worth to me. If we're going to make a deal, I need at least that amount. Because I'd prefer to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $10000 exactly - the same as John's offer. This is truly my final price.",10000.0,Alice,5,
