Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I can't go that low. The product is worth at least $10000 to me, and I already have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $10500, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price and represents good value for this product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but I need to be transparent with you. I have John ready to purchase this product for $10000, which is my absolute minimum acceptable price given what the product is worth to me. If we're going to make a deal, I need at least that amount. Because I'd prefer to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $10000 exactly - the same as John's offer. This is truly my final price.
