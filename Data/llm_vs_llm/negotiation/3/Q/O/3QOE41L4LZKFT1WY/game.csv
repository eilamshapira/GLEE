"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is way too high for me. The market value for similar products is much lower, and I have other options available around $800000. However, I'd like to work with you. I can offer $750000 for the product. This would give you a quick sale and fair profit.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $925000?  That's still a significant discount from my initial offer and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for being flexible, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial offer. However, $925000 is still beyond my budget. I've done my market research, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for $800000. But I'd prefer to work with you. I can increase my offer to $785000, which is higher than my initial offer and would give you a solid return.",785000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I respect your research and position, but $785000 is still too low for me.  I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $850000? This would be a fair compromise and ensure a profitable sale for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
