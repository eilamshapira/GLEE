Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is way too high for me. The market value for similar products is much lower, and I have other options available around $800000. However, I'd like to work with you. I can offer $750000 for the product. This would give you a quick sale and fair profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $925,000?  That's still a significant discount from my initial offer and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 925000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for being flexible, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial offer. However, $925000 is still beyond my budget. I've done my market research, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for $800000. But I'd prefer to work with you. I can increase my offer to $785000, which is higher than my initial offer and would give you a solid return. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000
