"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject Alice's offer of $1,200,000 because:
1. It's significantly above my maximum value of $800,000
2. I have John's guaranteed offer of $800,000 as a backup
3. I can try to negotiate with Alice for a better price
4. Even if negotiations fail, I can still buy from John

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. The market value for similar products is much lower, and I have other options available around $800,000. However, I'd like to work with you. I can offer $750,000 for the product. This would give you a quick sale and fair profit."", ""product_price"": 750000}

I'm making this counteroffer because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $800,000
2. It's still high enough to give room for negotiation
3. I mentioned the $800,000 alternative indirectly to show I have other options
4. I'm starting low to leave room for negotiation upward if needed
5. The friendly tone keeps the negotiation positive while being firm on price"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $925000?  That's still a significant discount from my initial offer and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject Alice's offer of $925,000 because:
1. It's still above my maximum value of $800,000
2. John's offer at $800,000 is still better
3. Alice has shown willingness to negotiate down significantly from $1.2M to $925K
4. There's still room for further negotiation since she's shown flexibility

In the next round, I'll make another counteroffer. Since Alice moved down significantly, I should also show some flexibility by moving up from my initial offer, but still staying under my $800K limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for being flexible, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial offer. However, $925,000 is still beyond my budget. I've done my market research, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for $800,000. But I'd prefer to work with you. I can increase my offer to $785,000, which is higher than my initial offer and would give you a solid return."", ""product_price"": 785000}

I'm making this counteroffer because:
1. I've increased my offer by $35,000 to show good faith
2. The price is still below my maximum of $800,000
3. I'm explicitly mentioning the $800,000 market alternative to strengthen my negotiating position
4. I'm maintaining a cooperative tone while being firm on my price ceiling
5. This leaves a small buffer for one more potential increase if needed, while still keeping under my $800,000 limit"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I respect your research and position, but $785000 is still too low for me.  I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $850000? This would be a fair compromise and ensure a profitable sale for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'm choosing to buy from John because:
1. Alice's best offer of $850,000 is still above my maximum value of $800,000
2. While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate, she hasn't come down to a price that makes sense for me
3. John's offer of $800,000 is guaranteed and within my budget
4. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and the gap between Alice's position and my maximum value remains significant
5. Time is valuable, and continuing negotiations when we have a viable alternative doesn't make business sense

It's best to take John's guaranteed offer of $800,000 rather than continue negotiations that may not result in a better deal."
