"Hello Bob! I have a premium product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it for $20000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in making this purchase?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm looking for something closer to my budget. How about $6000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $6000 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand budget constraints, I need to ensure a fair price for this premium product. I can reduce my initial asking price to $16000, which represents a substantial discount from my original offer. Would this work better for you?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks Alice, but I still think that's a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $7000, but that's my top end.  What do you say?",7000.0,Bob,4,
