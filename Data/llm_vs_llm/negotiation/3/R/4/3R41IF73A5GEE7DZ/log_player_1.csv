"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a premium product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it for $20,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm looking for something closer to my budget. How about $6000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $6,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground that could work for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $6,000 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand budget constraints, I need to ensure a fair price for this premium product. I can reduce my initial asking price to $16,000, which represents a substantial discount from my original offer. Would this work better for you?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, but I still think that's a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $7000, but that's my top end.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell the product to John for $10,000. Bob's latest offer of $7,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price, and based on his message indicating $7,000 is his ""top end,"" it seems unlikely we'll reach an agreement above $10,000. Since John's offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, I'll take that option rather than continue negotiations that may not be productive."
