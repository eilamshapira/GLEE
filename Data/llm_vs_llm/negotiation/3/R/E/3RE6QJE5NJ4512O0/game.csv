,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering my needs.",60.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $60 is too low for me to sell the product. I'm willing to come down to $110. Let me know if this works for you.",110.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see that we're still a bit apart on the price. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer the product for $105. This is the best I can do while still valuing the product appropriately.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $105 is still above my budget. I'm willing to compromise and meet you closer to the middle. I can offer $75 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering our previous discussions.",75.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to lower my price further to $102. This is my final offer before considering other options.",102.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. I can drop the price to $101, which is the lowest I can go while still valuing the product appropriately. Let me know if this works for you.",101.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to lower the price. However, $101 is still above what I'm willing to pay. Considering my previous offer of $75, I'm willing to increase it slightly to $78. I think this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",78.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $78 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you at $100, which is the lowest I can go. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",100.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're close but not quite there yet. I can offer the product for $100, which is my absolute bottom line. If this works for you, let's close the deal. If not, I'll need to consider other buyers.",100.0,Alice,7,
