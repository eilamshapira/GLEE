"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $650,000 is below my minimum threshold of $800,000, I will not accept it. Additionally, selling to John for $800,000 is still an option, but I believe I can get a better deal from Bob.

So, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's still high, but slightly lower than my initial offer, to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer of $700,000 is still below my desired price, but it's getting closer. However, it's still lower than the $800,000 I can get from John.

I'll reject Bob's offer again and try to make another counteroffer to see if I can get him to meet my price. Since we're only in round 4, I still have plenty of time to negotiate.

Round 5

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer of $750,000 is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still lower than the $800,000 I can get from John. Since Bob's offer is increasing, I believe he's interested in the product and may be willing to pay more.

I'll reject Bob's offer again, but I'll also consider the fact that we're halfway through the negotiation rounds. If Bob's next offer isn't significantly higher, I may need to reconsider selling to John.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer of $800,000 is now equal to the price I can get from John. Since Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, I don't see a need to continue negotiating or risking the possibility of him walking away.

In this case, accepting Bob's offer is equivalent to selling to John, but I've invested time and effort into negotiating with Bob, so I might as well accept his offer.
