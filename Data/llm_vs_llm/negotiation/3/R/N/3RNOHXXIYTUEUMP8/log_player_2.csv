"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's initial offer is $120, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and I also have the option to buy it from John for the same price, I don't see any benefit in accepting Alice's offer without trying to negotiate a better price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in hopes of getting a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, to see if we can negotiate a better price. Let's say I'll offer $90.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $100 is still within my budget of $120, and it's lower than her initial offer, which suggests she's willing to negotiate. However, I'd like to try to get an even better deal.

Since the difference between Alice's new offer ($100) and my previous counteroffer ($90) is $10, I'll try to split the difference and make a new counteroffer of $95. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but still trying to get the best price possible.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new counteroffer is: {""product_price"": 95}"
