"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking $120 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $120, reject it, or buy from John for $150.

Since Alice is offering the product for $120, which is:
1) Below my maximum valuation of $150
2) $30 less than John's price of $150

It makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer and save $30.
