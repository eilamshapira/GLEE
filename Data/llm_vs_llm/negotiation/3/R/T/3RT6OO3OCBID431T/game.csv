"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire a truly exceptional and valuable asset. I believe it could be a game-changer for you. I'm initially pricing it at $2500000. Let me know your thoughts.",2500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the asset you're offering, but $2500000 is beyond my budget. How about $1000000? I believe this figure is reasonable and Iâ€™m very interested in closing this deal with you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1000000 is too low. While I'm eager to work with you, I can't go that far below my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $2000000? I am confident that you will get great value out of this deal.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you, Alice, for your willingness to work with me. However, $2000000 is still quite above my budget. I can stretch a bit to $1200000, which is the maximum I could consider for this deal. I really hope we can find a way to make this work.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand budget constraints. I'm willing to come down further, but $1200000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's try $1800000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe represents a very fair price for the value you'll receive.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
