Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. Since I know:
1. The product is worth at least $10,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer of $10,000 from John
3. Bob's valuation is unknown, but he might value it higher

I should offer a price significantly above $10,000 to maximize my potential profit, while knowing I won't lose anything if Bob rejects since I have John's offer as a safety net.
