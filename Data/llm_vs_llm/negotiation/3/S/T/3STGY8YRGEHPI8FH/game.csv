"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $80. Let me know if that's something you'd be open to.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'd be willing to sell it to you for $165. Let me know if that's something you'd be open to.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate the discount, but I'm still a bit short of being comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'd like to propose $90 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be open to.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'd be willing to sell it to you for $155. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. Let me know if that's something you'd be open to.",155.0,Alice,5,
