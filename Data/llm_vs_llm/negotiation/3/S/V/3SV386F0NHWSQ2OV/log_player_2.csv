"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice's offer is significantly higher than John's price. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": $500,000}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial price, but it gives us a lot of room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below John's offer."
