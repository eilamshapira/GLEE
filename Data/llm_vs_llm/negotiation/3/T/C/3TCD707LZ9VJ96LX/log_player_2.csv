"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9500. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it can bring to you. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and Alice's initial offer of $9,500 is close to my maximum budget, I'll consider rejecting the offer to see if I can get a better deal. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since Alice's offer was $9,500, I'll offer $8,200, which is closer to the midpoint between my maximum budget and the price that Alice is willing to sell for.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 8200}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down from my initial price, but $8200 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $8800. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $8,800 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with. Since I know that Alice is willing to sell the product for $8,000, I'll try to make another counteroffer to see if I can get an even better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous offer, but still lower than Alice's current offer. I'll offer $8,500, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's current offer.
