"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is quite a bit higher than what I was looking to spend. Given current market conditions and similar products I've seen, I would be willing to offer $12500 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you see its value. However, I must say that $12500 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's rarity and demand. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your proposal. I can offer the product to you for $16000, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
