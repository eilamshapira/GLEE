"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be a great fit for you. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm pricing it at $18,000. I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is quite a bit higher than what I was looking to spend. Given current market conditions and similar products I've seen, I would be willing to offer $12500 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you see its value. However, I must say that $12,500 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's rarity and demand. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your proposal. I can offer the product to you for $16,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
