"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be a great fit for you. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm pricing it at $18000. I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $18,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($15,000) and John's price ($15,000), there's no reason to accept this offer. While I could make a counteroffer, I already know that John is willing to sell at $15,000, which is the maximum I value the product at. However, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to see if Alice might be willing to go lower than John's price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but leaves room for negotiation, starting significantly lower than John's price of $15,000.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18,000 is quite a bit higher than what I was looking to spend. Given current market conditions and similar products I've seen, I would be willing to offer $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you see its value. However, I must say that $12500 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's rarity and demand. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your proposal. I can offer the product to you for $16000, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $16,000 is still higher than both my maximum value ($15,000) and John's price ($15,000). Since John is offering the product for $15,000, and Alice's current offer is still above that, it doesn't make sense to continue negotiating at this point. I'll choose to buy from John as this is the best guaranteed price available and matches my maximum value.
