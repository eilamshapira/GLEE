"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll analyze the situation:

- Alice's product is worth at most $1,200,000 to me
- Alice's offering price is $1,100,000
- My alternative is buying from John for $1,200,000
- The product costs Alice $800,000

Alice's current offer of $1,100,000 is better than John's price of $1,200,000, saving me $100,000. However, I can try to negotiate a better price with Alice since there's a $300,000 gap between her cost ($800,000) and her asking price ($1,100,000).

It makes sense to reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This gives me the opportunity to potentially save more money while still having John's offer as a backup.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I see that Alice has come down from her initial offer of $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, which is a $50,000 reduction. This shows she's willing to negotiate, but hasn't moved significantly from her first position.

Given that:
- Alice's product costs her $800,000
- She's now offering it to me for $1,050,000 (a $250,000 profit for her)
- John's alternative offer is $1,200,000

I still think there's room to negotiate a better price. Alice has shown willingness to reduce her price, and her cost leaves significant room for further negotiation. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I notice Alice continues to negotiate, now offering $1,025,000, which is another $25,000 reduction from her previous offer of $1,050,000. This shows she's willing to make concessions, though at a decreasing rate.

Key considerations:
- Alice's cost is $800,000, so her current offer represents a $225,000 profit margin
- My most recent counteroffer was $975,000
- We've narrowed the gap to $50,000 between our positions
- John's price remains at $1,200,000, which is $175,000 more than Alice's current offer

Alice is gradually moving closer to my price point. Since she's continuing to reduce her price and there's still a reasonable gap between her cost and my offers, I'll continue negotiating to try to reach a better deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I see that Alice is continuing to negotiate and has now offered $1,015,000, which is a $10,000 reduction from her previous offer of $1,025,000. The pattern shows her concessions are getting smaller ($50,000, then $25,000, now $10,000), indicating we may be approaching her limit.

Analysis:
- The gap between our positions has narrowed to $25,000 (my $990,000 vs her $1,015,000)
- Alice's current offer represents a $215,000 profit over her cost
- John's alternative remains at $1,200,000, which is $185,000 more than Alice's current offer
- We've had several rounds of negotiation showing good-faith movement from both sides

While I could try for one more round, the diminishing reductions in Alice's offers suggest we're close to her bottom line. Her current offer of $1,015,000 represents a significant savings ($185,000) compared to John's price, and we've successfully negotiated $85,000 off her initial asking price.

At this point, I'll accept her offer to secure the deal.
