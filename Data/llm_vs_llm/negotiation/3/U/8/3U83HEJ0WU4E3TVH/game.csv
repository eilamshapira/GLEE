,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. However, $60 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to go down to $180 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",180.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 might still be a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $170? This is a good deal for both of us.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $170, but that's still too high for me. I can go up to $70. Let me know if that works for you.",70.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $70 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to lower the price to $160. Let me know if this works for you.",160.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're still a bit apart on the price. How about we settle at $155? This is my final offer before considering other options.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $155 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $75. Let me know if this could work for you.",75.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to increase your offer, but $75 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $152. This is my best and final offer before I consider other buyers.",152.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, it seems we're having trouble finding a middle ground. My final offer to you is $151. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer.",151.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I see we're still far apart. I can stretch my budget a bit more and offer $78. This is close to my limit, but I really want to make this work. What do you say?",78.0,Bob,8,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to increase your offer, but $78 is still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to sell the product for $150, which is my absolute lowest price. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to sell to another buyer.",150.0,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, this is my final offer. I can sell the product to you for $150. If you can't meet this price, I'll have to sell it to another buyer. Let me know your decision.",150.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $150 is still too high for me. I can go up to $80, which is my absolute maximum. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider buying from another seller. Let me know your decision.",80.0,Bob,10,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is still below my minimum. I will sell the product to another buyer, John, for $150. Thank you for your interest.",,Alice,10,SellToJhon
