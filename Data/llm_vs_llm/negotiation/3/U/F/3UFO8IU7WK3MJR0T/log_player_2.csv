"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $15000. This is a unique opportunityâ€”should you pass on this offer, I will have to sell it to another buyer at that same price. I'd be delighted to see you secure it, so please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $15,000
2. The product is worth exactly $15,000 to me
3. John is also selling it for $15,000
4. I need to buy the product either way

Since all prices are exactly $15,000, and I'm indifferent between the sellers (as no additional information about product quality or other factors is provided), I can choose any option. However, since Alice made the initial offer and has already engaged in communication, it would be reasonable to accept her offer.
