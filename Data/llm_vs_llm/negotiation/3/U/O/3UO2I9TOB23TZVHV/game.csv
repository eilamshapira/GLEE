"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $250.",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $50 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $200? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $200 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. This is the highest I'm comfortable going, considering I can get it from John for $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. Given your latest offer, I'm willing to lower the price further to $175. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to reach an agreement with you. Let me know if this works for you.",175.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the further reduction to $175, but I'm still not comfortable paying that much. Considering I can get the product from John for $100, I'm willing to meet you in the middle of your latest offer and John's price. I'll offer $137.50. If you're willing to sell it to me for that price, I'm ready to make the purchase.",137.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go a bit lower than my last offer to $160. This is the lowest I can go while still valuing the product appropriately. Let me know if this works for you.",160.0,Alice,7,
