"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I want to start with a reasonably high price to test Bob's willingness to pay, while leaving room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","I notice that Bob is starting at exactly $120, which is my minimum acceptable price (and equal to John's standing offer). Since this is just round 2 and we have 8 more potential rounds of negotiation, I believe I can get a better price than this.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob started at $120, which is my minimum acceptable price, I'll come down somewhat from my initial offer but still aim for a price significantly above my minimum.
