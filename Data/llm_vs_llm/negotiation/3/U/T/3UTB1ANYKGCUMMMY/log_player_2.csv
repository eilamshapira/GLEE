"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $190. It's a valuable item and I believe it's a fair price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $190. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $190
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to consider the options carefully. Alice is offering the product for $190, which is significantly higher than my maximum acceptable price of $120. John is already offering the product for $120, which is exactly my maximum price point.

Given that:
1. Alice's offer ($190) is well above my limit of $120
2. I have an immediate alternative to buy from John at $120
3. Even if I reject and make a counteroffer to Alice, there's no guarantee she'll go below $120
