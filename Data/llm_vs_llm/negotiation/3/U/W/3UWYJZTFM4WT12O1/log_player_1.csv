"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll offer Bob a price close to the product's value to him while ensuring I get a good profit.

{""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer of $110 is a reasonable counteroffer. While it's less than my initial offer of $115, it's still $10 above my minimum acceptable value of $100, and only $10 below Bob's maximum value of $120. Given we're only in round 2 of 10, I could try to negotiate further, but there's a risk of losing Bob as a buyer. The guaranteed option with John is at my minimum acceptable value, so Bob's offer is better.
