(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","That's quite a low offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, I can't accept that. I know John is offering $1,500,000, so I need to see a better offer to justify not selling to him.

This tells me you recognize *some* of the product's worth. However, I can't accept that offer. I know I can get $1,500,000 from John.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
