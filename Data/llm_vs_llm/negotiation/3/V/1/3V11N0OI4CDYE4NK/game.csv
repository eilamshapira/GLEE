"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",50.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $50 is quite a bit lower than I'm looking for.  While I'm willing to negotiate, this product is worth considerably more to me. How about $200?",200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $50 was a bit low, but $200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
