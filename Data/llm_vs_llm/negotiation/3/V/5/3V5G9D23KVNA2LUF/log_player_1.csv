Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $115. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value."", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm hoping to find a better deal. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. While $105 is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation since the product is worth $120 to Bob. I'll try to find a middle ground between our positions.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $110? This is a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $110? This is a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, Alice, I understand. How about $107? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $107. This is a reasonable compromise as it's better than my alternative of selling to John for $100, and pushing further might risk losing the deal altogether. While it's less than my initial target, it's still a profitable sale."
