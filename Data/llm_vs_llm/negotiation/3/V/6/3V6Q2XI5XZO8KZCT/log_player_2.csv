"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $95.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $80
2. Alice is offering the product for $95
3. John is offering the product for $80

Since Alice's offer ($95) is higher than both:
- My maximum value for the product ($80)
- John's alternative offer ($80)

It would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. Since John's offer matches my maximum value and is lower than Alice's offer, the best decision would be to buy from John.
