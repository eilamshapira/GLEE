"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get the product for a lower price by negotiating with Alice.  While $10,000 is a better deal than $12,000, there's room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fair Offer:**  $8,500 is a fair price, considering the product is worth $8,000 to Alice and $12,000 to you. 
* **Negotiation Space:** It leaves room for Alice to counter if she's not comfortable with $8,500, but it's still a significant discount from her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $9,500 is a good price for you, considering it's lower than John's price and closer to your target.
* **Limited Upside:**  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk Alice will walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
