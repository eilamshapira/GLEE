You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. I will not buy from John yet, as I want to try to negotiate a better price with Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and closer to my target price. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a price that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still shows that I'm interested in buying the product.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,000,000 is still above my budget of $800,000. While it's a better offer than her initial one, I'm not willing to pay that much for the product.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and consider making another counteroffer. However, I'll also keep in mind that I have the option to buy from John for $800,000, which is my maximum budget.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer is still above my budget, I'll make another counteroffer that is closer to my target price. I'll try to meet Alice halfway between her latest offer and my previous counteroffer.

My previous counteroffer was $900,000, and Alice's latest offer is $1,000,000. I'll offer a price that is slightly lower than the midpoint of these two prices.
