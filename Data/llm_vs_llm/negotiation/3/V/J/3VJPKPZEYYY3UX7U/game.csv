"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000.  This is a significant discount and demonstrates my confidence in the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to offer a discount, but I believe we can find a price point that works better for both of us. While I understand the product is valuable, I would be willing to pay $800000 for it. This would still give you a substantial return while providing me with more value. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, though.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $900000? This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits us both.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Your movement on the price shows good faith, and I'd like to respond in kind. I can move up from my initial offer to $850000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and would still give you a good return while allowing me some cost savings. Would you consider this fair middle ground?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $850000 still leaves me a bit short of my goal.  I'm confident the product's value will justify a higher price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer it to you for $875000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to gain something from this deal. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
