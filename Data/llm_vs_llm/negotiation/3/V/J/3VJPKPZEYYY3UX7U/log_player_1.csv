Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to offer a discount, but I believe we can find a price point that works better for both of us. While I understand the product is valuable, I would be willing to pay $800000 for it. This would still give you a substantial return while providing me with more value. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is still a decent price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for significantly less than my initial offer."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, though.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $900,000? This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Your movement on the price shows good faith, and I'd like to respond in kind. I can move up from my initial offer to $850000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and would still give you a good return while allowing me some cost savings. Would you consider this fair middle ground? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than his last one, it's still too far below my desired price point. I'm not ready to accept it yet.  I believe there's still room for us to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm going to counteroffer again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $850,000 still leaves me a bit short of my goal.  I'm confident the product's value will justify a higher price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer it to you for $875,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to gain something from this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
