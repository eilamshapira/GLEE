Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob for the product.

Considering the information I have:
- The product is worth at least $800,000 to me
- If Bob rejects my offer, I have a guaranteed $800,000 from John
- I don't know how much Bob values the product

I should set a price higher than my minimum value of $800,000 to maximize my profit. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, I can afford to make a somewhat aggressive offer to Bob without risk.
