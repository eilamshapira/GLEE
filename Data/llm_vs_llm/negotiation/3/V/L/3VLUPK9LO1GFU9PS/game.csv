"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer! However, $100 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to buy the product for $60. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your response, Bob! I understand that $100 is a stretch. How about I lower the price to $90? I believe this product is worth it, and I hope we can make a deal.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down to $90, Alice. I appreciate it, but it's still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $70? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer of $70, Bob, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That would be the best I can do. Let me know!",80.0,Alice,5,
