"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll find valuable. Based on the quality and features of this product, I'm offering it to you for $120. This is a fair price considering the value it provides, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I do think the product is valuable, but $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90, considering the product's value and my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $90, but that's too close to my minimum value for the product. I know this product is worth significantly more in the market. I can come down to $110, which is still a great value for a product of this quality. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $110. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $100, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need a better deal than $110.",100.0,Bob,4,
