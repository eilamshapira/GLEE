"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,500,000) and also lower than what I initially offered ($2,000,000), and considering we have multiple rounds to negotiate, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer that is closer to my initial offer but slightly reduced to show willingness to negotiate.

Since we are only in Round 4 and have 6 more rounds to negotiate, I will reject Bob's offer again and try to meet him halfway between my last offer and his last offer, or at least make a significant move towards his direction to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.
