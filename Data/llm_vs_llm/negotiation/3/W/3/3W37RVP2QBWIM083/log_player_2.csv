"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer is $120, which is the same price as John's offer, and it's the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, there's no advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately. I should try to negotiate for a better price with Alice first, knowing I can always fall back to buying from John at $120 if needed.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low that it would be considered unreasonable.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has reduced her price to $110, which is better than both her initial offer and John's price ($120). However, since we still have several rounds left for negotiation and Alice has already shown willingness to reduce the price, I'll try one more round of negotiation to potentially get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $120 to $110, showing some flexibility, I'll increase my previous offer but still try to get a better deal than $110.
