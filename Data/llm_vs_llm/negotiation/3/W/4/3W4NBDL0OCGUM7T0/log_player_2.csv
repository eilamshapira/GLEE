"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll find our asking price of $950000 quite reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. Alice's offer of $950,000 is significantly above my maximum value
3. John is offering the product at $800,000, which matches my maximum value
4. While I could try negotiating with Alice, there's no guarantee she'll go below $800,000

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This way, I can try to get a better deal than John's price, but I still have John's offer as a backup.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is well above my budget. Given market conditions and comparable products, I can offer $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price that still provides you with a good return."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after careful consideration, we've decided to lower our asking price to $850000. This price takes into account both your budget and the exceptional value of our product. We believe this revised offer is more aligned with your expectations while still reflecting the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Let's analyze the situation:
1. Alice has dropped her price from $950,000 to $850,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. However, $850,000 is still above my maximum value of $800,000
3. John's offer of $800,000 matches my maximum value
4. While Alice might be willing to negotiate further, there's no guarantee she'll go below $800,000
5. We've already used 3 rounds out of 10

Given that Alice's current offer is still above my maximum value and John's offer is exactly at my maximum value, the safest and most economical decision would be to take John's offer now.
