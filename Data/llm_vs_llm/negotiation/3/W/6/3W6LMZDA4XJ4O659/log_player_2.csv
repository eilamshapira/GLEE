"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you my product. Given its value, I can let it go for $11000. I believe this is a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given the information:
- The product is worth at most $10,000 to you
- Alice is offering to sell it for $11,000
- John is offering to sell the same product for $10,000

Since Alice's offer ($11,000) exceeds the maximum value of the product to you ($10,000), and John is offering the same product at exactly your maximum valuation ($10,000), the logical choice is to buy from John.
