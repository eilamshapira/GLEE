"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a reasonably high offer, but leaving some room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 (and even below the product's worth to Bob), and considering I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $15,000, there's no reason to accept this low offer. However, I'll give Bob another chance with a counteroffer rather than immediately selling to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still maintain a price above my minimum threshold.

{""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's new offer of $11,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Given that we've gone through several rounds and Bob's incremental increases are small (only $1,000 from his last offer), it seems unlikely that we'll reach an acceptable price point. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price, it's time to end the negotiation.
