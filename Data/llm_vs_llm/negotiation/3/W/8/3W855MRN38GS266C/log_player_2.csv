Alice's offer is much higher than both my upper limit and John's price. I should try to negotiate a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

This is a starting point. It's a significant jump down from Alice's opening offer and leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly below my $12,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice is coming down, but it's still too high. I'll counteroffer to keep the negotiation moving."

I'm getting closer to my limit, but I still want to leave room for negotiation in case Alice is willing to come down further."
