"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it could be a great fit for you. How about we start at a price of $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me think about this:
1. Alice's offer is $95
2. The product is worth $80 to me
3. John is willing to sell it for $80
4. Alice's offer is significantly higher than both my valuation and John's price

Since Alice's initial offer of $95 is well above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80), it would not be rational to accept it. While I could reject and make a counteroffer, I already know that John's price matches my maximum valuation, so there's no reason to engage in a potentially lengthy negotiation when I can get the exact same product at my maximum acceptable price right now.
