"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is below my maximum budget, I should try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I don't know Alice's reservation price (the minimum price she's willing to accept), I'll start with a counteroffer that is slightly above her potential reservation price, which is $800,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $950,000 is still below my maximum budget of $1,200,000, but it's getting closer. Since Alice rejected my previous counteroffer of $900,000, it's likely that her reservation price is higher than that. I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a new counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one, but still lower than Alice's current offer. This will give Alice an opportunity to consider a compromise.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $930,000 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $920,000. It seems like we're getting close to a mutually acceptable price. Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'll think carefully about my next move.

Accepting Alice's offer of $930,000 would save me $270,000 compared to buying from John. Rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer risks Alice not accepting it and me having to buy from John for $1,200,000.

Considering the potential savings, I think it's worth accepting Alice's offer.
