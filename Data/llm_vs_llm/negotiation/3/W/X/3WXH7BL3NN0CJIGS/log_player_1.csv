Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider the best price to offer Bob. 

The product is worth $80 to Bob, so he won't pay more than that.
The product is worth at least $120 to me, and I have John willing to buy it for $120.

Since Bob values the product at less than what I can get from John, the rational decision is to not make a deal with Bob. Any price I offer below $120 would give me less than what I can get from John, and any price at or above $120 would be rejected by Bob since it exceeds his valuation.

Therefore, I'll offer Bob a price that I know he won't accept, so I can then sell to John for $120.
