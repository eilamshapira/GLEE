"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I can offer you a better price, but I still need to ensure I get a fair value for the product.",180.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm still a bit above your offer, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.
