Bob's offer:

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since he's willing to pay $100, I'll try to meet him halfway between my previous offer and his new offer. My next offer will be $140.

Since Bob's offer of $120 is still below my target price and John is willing to buy the product for $150, I think it's best to sell the product to John. This ensures I get a better price for the product."
