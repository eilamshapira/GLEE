"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $99. I think it's a great deal and would be very useful for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'll analyze this situation based on my goals:

1. The product is worth no more than $80 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $99
3. John will sell it to me for $80
4. My goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible

Since Alice's offer ($99) exceeds the $80 value the product has to me, and John is offering exactly $80, the most economical choice is to buy from John.
