"Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional quality and the market demand, I'm confident that it's worth $14000. I'm open to discussions, but I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is well above my budget. While I understand you value the product highly, similar products in the market are available for much less. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $7000 at this time. This is a fair price considering current market conditions.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"After considering your position, I'm willing to lower my initial offer. I believe $12000 is a more reasonable price that reflects both the product's value and your budget constraints. I'm confident that this offer represents a fair compromise for both parties.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $12000 is still substantially above what I can justify spending. I've done extensive market research, and I can get a similar product elsewhere for $8000. However, I value doing business with you and would be willing to offer $7500. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents the upper range of what I can spend.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"After careful consideration, I'm willing to lower my previous offer. I believe $10000 is a fair price that takes into account both your budget and the product's value. This offer demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,
