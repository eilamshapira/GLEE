Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is well above my budget. While I understand you value the product highly, similar products in the market are available for much less.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $12000 is still substantially above what I can justify spending. I've done extensive market research, and I can get a similar product elsewhere for $8000. However, I value doing business with you and would be willing to offer $7500. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents the upper range of what I can spend.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

I'm willing to continue negotiating, so please consider a higher price."""
