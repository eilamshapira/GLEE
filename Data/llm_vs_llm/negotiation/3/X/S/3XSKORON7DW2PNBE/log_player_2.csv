"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that Alice's offer is $15,000, which is significantly higher than the maximum value of $8,000 that the product is worth to me, and also higher than John's alternative offer of $8,000, this is not a good deal.

I have the guaranteed option to buy from John at $8,000, which matches my maximum valuation. There's no reason to accept Alice's much higher price.
