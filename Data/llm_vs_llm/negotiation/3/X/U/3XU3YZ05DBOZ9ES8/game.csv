"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to go down to $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand $110 might still be a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $105? Let me know if that works for you!",105.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $105 is still a bit too high. My maximum budget for this is $70. Would you be willing to sell it for that price?",70.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I really want to make this work for you, but $70 is still below my minimum. I can do $102 as my final offer. What do you say?",102.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. My absolute lowest price is $101. This is my final offer. Let me know if you can accept this!",101.0,Alice,5,
