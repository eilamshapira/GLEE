"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, the initial price is beyond my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I need a price that aligns more closely with my financial constraints. How about we start at $600000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $600,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe the product is worth more. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is an option, but I'd like to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that the initial price was beyond your budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must emphasize that this product is truly unique and holds significant value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure that the price reflects its worth. I can offer a slight reduction from my initial offer, but I still need to prioritize the product's value."", ""product_price"": 4500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to show my commitment to acquiring it. Could we settle at $650000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. While Bob is increasing his offer, it's still significantly below my initial price and what I believe the product is worth. Since $650,000 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, I'll try to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can meet at a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. It shows that you're serious about acquiring the product, and I value that. However, the gap between your offer and my valuation is still quite significant. I'm trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to reduce my price further, but I need you to meet me closer to the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 3800000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. To show my commitment and in an attempt to narrow the gap, I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000. I hope this brings us closer to a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While he's incrementally increasing his offer, the difference between his bid and my valuation remains substantial. I'll continue to negotiate, hoping to find a price that better reflects the product's value. Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer, I'll make another counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer of $700,000. I see that you're making an effort to increase your bid, and I appreciate that. However, as we've discussed, the product's value is significantly higher than your current offer. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to see a more substantial move towards my valuation. Considering your last offer, I'm reducing my price again, but I hope you can understand that I need a serious commitment to the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, and I'm trying to meet you halfway. Considering your latest offer, I'm willing to increase my bid to $750000. This is a significant step up from my previous offers, and I hope it demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $750,000, although increased, still falls short of my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Given that I have the option to sell the product to John for $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer, I'll make another counteroffer. However, I'll also consider the fact that we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds, and I might need to make a more decisive move to either close the deal with Bob or opt for the sale to John. My next counteroffer will reflect a more serious consideration of Bob's bids while keeping my options open. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your latest increase to $750,000. It shows you're committed to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. However, as we've discussed, the product's value to me is higher. Given our negotiation is progressing, I'm willing to make a more substantial reduction to meet you closer. I'll offer $1,200,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial price. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 10
Bob's offer:

Given that Bob's final offer of $800,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and considering that this is the last round of negotiation, I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. This option ensures that I meet my minimum price requirement and avoids the risk of accepting a lower offer from Bob. Throughout the negotiation, I've tried to find a mutually beneficial price with Bob, but ultimately, selling to John provides a better financial outcome for me."
