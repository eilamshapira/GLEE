"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $200 is way above my maximum value of $80 for the product. Since I can always buy from John for $80, there's no reason to accept such a high price. I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 50}

I'll offer $50, which is significantly below John's price of $80. This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to get a better deal than John's offer. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate up to a price below $80, or I can ultimately go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $180 is still well above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). While Alice has reduced the price from $200 to $180, it's still not competitive. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, as there's still potential to negotiate a better price. If we can't reach an agreement below $80, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 60}

I'll increase my previous offer slightly to $60, showing some willingness to negotiate while still staying well below my maximum value of $80. This leaves room for further negotiation while maintaining a good margin below John's price. If Alice doesn't accept or come back with a reasonable counteroffer, I can still take John's offer of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offers are consistently remaining well above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80), and she hasn't shown significant movement toward a reasonable price range despite my counteroffers, it makes more sense to take John's guaranteed offer of $80. Alice has only dropped from $200 to $160, suggesting she's unlikely to match or beat John's price in any reasonable number of negotiations. I'll end the negotiation and buy from John."
