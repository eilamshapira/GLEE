"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice's offer is $12,000
3. John's price is also $12,000
4. Both prices are equal and at my maximum valuation

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($12,000), and this price is at my maximum valuation, I would reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate for a better price. There's no advantage in accepting this offer immediately since I can always buy from John at the same price later.
