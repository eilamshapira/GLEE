"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1800000 is too high for me. I value the product, but my budget is limited. I'd like to offer $600000. Please let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $600000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. I understand budget constraints, but I need to consider the product's true worth. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1500000, which represents a $300000 reduction. This is a premium product with substantial market value. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for lowering the price. However, $1500000 is still beyond my budget. I can offer $700000. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $700000 is still substantially below what I can accept for this product. I understand you have budget constraints, but I also need to ensure I receive fair value. Given that I have another buyer willing to pay $1200000, I cannot go below that price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1300000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents only a slight premium over my alternative option. Would you be able to meet me at this price?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, $1300000 is still too high for me. My final offer is $800000. This is the maximum I am willing to pay. Please let me know if you accept, otherwise I will have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
