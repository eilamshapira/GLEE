Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $600000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. I understand budget constraints, but I need to consider the product's true worth. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1500000, which represents a $300000 reduction. This is a premium product with substantial market value. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice is still way off my budget. I will increase my offer slightly but remain far below her asking price to see if she's willing to negotiate in good faith.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $700000 is still substantially below what I can accept for this product. I understand you have budget constraints, but I also need to ensure I receive fair value. Given that I have another buyer willing to pay $1200000, I cannot go below that price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1300000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents only a slight premium over my alternative option. Would you be able to meet me at this price?
