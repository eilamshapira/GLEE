"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to get a bit more for the product. How about we split the difference between your $100 offer and my previous price of $140? That would put us at $120.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but $120 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up a bit more, but I need to stay within my limit. How about we try $90? It's a reasonable price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm starting to think that we might not be able to come to an agreement. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $110, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",110.0,Alice,7,
