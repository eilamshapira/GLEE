Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target price. $60 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

$100 is still lower than my target price, and I believe I can get closer to $150. I'll make another counteroffer to try to bridge the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to get a bit more for the product. How about we split the difference between your $100 offer and my previous price of $140? That would put us at $120."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but $120 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up a bit more, but I need to stay within my limit. How about we try $90? It's a reasonable price, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

$90 is still too low, and I'm not willing to sell the product for a price that's significantly below my target. I'll try to make another counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to meet me at a higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm starting to think that we might not be able to come to an agreement. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $110, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 110}"
