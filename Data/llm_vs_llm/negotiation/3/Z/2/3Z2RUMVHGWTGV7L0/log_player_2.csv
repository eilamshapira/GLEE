"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1400000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1500000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $1,400,000
2. I can buy from John for $1,500,000
3. The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me
4. Alice's cost is $1,200,000

Alice's offer at $1,400,000 is better than John's price of $1,500,000, saving me $100,000. However, since this is a negotiation and Alice's cost is $1,200,000, there might be room for a better price if I reject this first offer. Alice has a $200,000 margin between her cost and current offer, so she might be willing to lower the price to ensure a sale rather than lose the deal completely.

Given that I can reject the offer and try to negotiate for a better price, I'll choose to:
