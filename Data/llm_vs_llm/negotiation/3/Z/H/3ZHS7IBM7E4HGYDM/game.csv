"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its market value and potential returns, I'm offering it at $950000. This price reflects the product's high quality and value proposition.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe $950000 is quite high for this product. Based on my market research and valuation, I would like to make a counteroffer of $850000. This represents a fair price that would be profitable for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I need to be transparent - $850000 is too close to my bottom line. This product has proven market value and significant potential for returns. I can come down from my initial offer to $920000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to your business.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, $920000 is still higher than what I believe is fair market value for this product. I can increase my offer to $880000, which represents a significant investment and should provide a healthy profit margin. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in reaching an agreement.",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your increased offer. While we're moving in the right direction, I need to emphasize the significant value this product brings. Given its proven market value and your company's potential ROI, I can reduce my price to $900000. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true worth.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility in this negotiation. We're getting closer to finding common ground, and I recognize the value of the product. Given that we've both shown willingness to be reasonable, I propose we meet in the middle at $890000. This represents another increase from my side and would be a fair price point that benefits both parties.",890000.0,Bob,6,
