"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe $950000 is quite high for this product. Based on my market research and valuation, I would like to make a counteroffer of $850000. This represents a fair price that would be profitable for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll counter in the next round. $850,000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. There's still room for negotiation to reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I need to be transparent - $850,000 is too close to my bottom line. This product has proven market value and significant potential for returns. I can come down from my initial offer to $920,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to your business."", ""product_price"": 920000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, $920000 is still higher than what I believe is fair market value for this product. I can increase my offer to $880000, which represents a significant investment and should provide a healthy profit margin. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll continue negotiating. Bob has shown willingness to increase his offer, moving up by $30,000 from his initial offer. This suggests there's still room for negotiation, and since we're only in round 4 of 10, we have time to reach a better price. The fact that he's making incremental increases suggests he has flexibility in his budget."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your increased offer. While we're moving in the right direction, I need to emphasize the significant value this product brings. Given its proven market value and your company's potential ROI, I can reduce my price to $900,000. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility in this negotiation. We're getting closer to finding common ground, and I recognize the value of the product. Given that we've both shown willingness to be reasonable, I propose we meet in the middle at $890000. This represents another increase from my side and would be a fair price point that benefits both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $890,000. This is a good deal for several reasons:
1. It's significantly above my minimum price of $800,000
2. Bob has shown consistent willingness to negotiate but his incremental increases are getting smaller, suggesting we're reaching his limit
3. We're already in round 6, and continuing to push might risk Bob walking away
4. The $890,000 price represents a fair compromise between our positions and ensures a good profit margin for both parties"
