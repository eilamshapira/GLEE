Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth at least $15,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed fallback option of $15,000 from John
3. Since I don't know Bob's maximum willingness to pay, I should set a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price
4. If Bob rejects, I lose nothing as I can still sell to John
5. Therefore, I can be aggressive in my pricing
