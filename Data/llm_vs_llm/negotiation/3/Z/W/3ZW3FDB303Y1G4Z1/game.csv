"Thank you for your offer, Alice, but $200 is outside my budget. How about we start the negotiation at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $200 might be outside your budget, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can work something out.",190.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $190 is still above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $100 is a step in the right direction, I still need to get a bit more for the product. How about we try $175? It's a significant compromise on my part, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",175.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand that youâ€™re trying to meet me halfway, but $175 is still quite high for my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $110?",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued negotiation, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to get at least $160 for the product. If you're unable to meet me at this price, I may need to consider other options.",160.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $160 is still out of my budget. How about we find a middle ground at $130?",130.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. Considering your offer of $130, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'll meet you in the middle between my previous offer of $160 and your offer of $130, which would be $145. If you're unable to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to another buyer.",145.0,Alice,9,
