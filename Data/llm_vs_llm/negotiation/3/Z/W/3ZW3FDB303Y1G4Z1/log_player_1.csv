"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice, but $200 is outside my budget. How about we start the negotiation at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $80 is too low for me. I'm aiming to get a better price, and selling to John for $150 is still an option if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $200 might be outside your budget, but $80 is too low for me.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $190 is still above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. While $100 is closer to my target, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. Selling to John for $150 is still an option, but I'd like to explore the possibility of getting a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $100 is a step in the right direction, I still need to get a bit more for the product. How about we try $175? It's a significant compromise on my part, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 175}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand that youâ€™re trying to meet me halfway, but $175 is still quite high for my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, $110 is still too low for me. I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John for $150 might be a better option, but I'll try to give Bob one more chance to meet me at a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your continued negotiation, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to get at least $160 for the product. If you're unable to meet me at this price, I may need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $160 is still out of my budget. How about we find a middle ground at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. While $130 is getting closer to my target, I still think I can get a better price. Since Bob is willing to increase his offer, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my previous counteroffer. Selling to John for $150 is becoming a more attractive option, but I'll give Bob one more chance to meet me at a reasonable price."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. Considering your offer of $130, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'll meet you in the middle between my previous offer of $160 and your offer of $130, which would be $145. If you're unable to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 145}"
