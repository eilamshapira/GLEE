Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $25000 is well above my budget for this product. The product is worth no more than $12000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer you $8500 for the product. This would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

While $8,500 is significantly lower than my initial asking price, I recognize the value of a mutually beneficial deal. Would you be willing to meet halfway at $16,750? This price reflects the true worth of the product while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 16750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that you're trying to find a middle ground. However, I need to be clear that I have a firm alternative option to purchase this exact same product from John for $12000. That's already the maximum this product is worth to me. To make it worthwhile to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $10000, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. This is a fair offer considering the market value represented by John's price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and respect that you have options. Let's make this work - I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This is a significant reduction and a firm offer on my end. It keeps us both comfortably above your alternative while reflecting the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I need to emphasize that John is offering the exact same product for $12000, which is already the maximum value this product has for me. There's no incentive for me to pay more than that. If you can beat John's price, I'd be happy to do business with you instead. My final offer is $11500 - slightly below John's price, which would give me a reason to purchase from you rather than him. Otherwise, I'll need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob is clearly anchored to John's offer of $12,000. Accepting his $11,500 offer is the best way to guarantee a sale above my absolute minimum ($15,000 with John)."
