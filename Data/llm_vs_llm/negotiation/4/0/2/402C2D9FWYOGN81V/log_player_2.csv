"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $25000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's initial price of $25,000 is significantly above what the product is worth to me (no more than $12,000). Since I can definitely buy the same product from John for $12,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's much higher offer.

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer you $8,500 for the product. This would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget and interest in the product. While $8500 is significantly lower than my initial asking price, I recognize the value of a mutually beneficial deal. Would you be willing to meet halfway at $16750? This price reflects the true worth of the product while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's counteroffer of $16,750 is still higher than what I can get from John ($12,000) and exceeds what the product is worth to me. Since I have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $12,000 from John, there's no reason to accept a higher price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that you're trying to find a middle ground. However, I need to be clear that I have a firm alternative option to purchase this exact same product from John for $12,000. That's already the maximum this product is worth to me. To make it worthwhile to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $10,000, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. This is a fair offer considering the market value represented by John's price."", ""product_price"": 10000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and respect that you have options. Let's make this work - I'm willing to come down to $14000.  This is a significant reduction and a firm offer on my end. It keeps us both comfortably above your alternative while reflecting the value of this product.

However, I need to emphasize that John is offering the exact same product for $12,000, which is already the maximum value this product has for me. There's no incentive for me to pay more than that. If you can beat John's price, I'd be happy to do business with you instead. My final offer is $11,500 - slightly below John's price, which would give me a reason to purchase from you rather than him.
