"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000), it would not be rational to accept her offer. The best option is to buy from John at $1,200,000, which matches my maximum value and saves me $800,000 compared to Alice's offer.
