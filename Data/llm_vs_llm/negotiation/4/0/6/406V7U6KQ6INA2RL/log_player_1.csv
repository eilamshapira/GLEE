Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. Since I know I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John if Bob rejects, I should price the product significantly higher than $15,000 to maximize my potential profit. However, I don't want to price it so high that it's automatically rejected. I'll set a price that gives Bob room to consider while still being very profitable for me if accepted.
