"Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than the maximum value of $12,000 that the product is worth to me, and John is offering the same product for $12,000, the logical choice would be to buy from John.
