Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. 

Bob values the product at $15,000, and I have a guaranteed fallback option of $10,000 from John. To maximize my profit while ensuring a reasonable chance of acceptance, I should price it below Bob's valuation but well above my minimum acceptable price.

A price of $13,500 would give Bob a $1,500 surplus while giving me a significant premium over my fallback option. This seems like a fair split of the excess value, making it attractive enough for Bob to accept while maximizing my potential profit.
