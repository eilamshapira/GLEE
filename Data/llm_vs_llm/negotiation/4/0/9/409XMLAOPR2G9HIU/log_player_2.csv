"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer or make a counteroffer. Let me analyze the situation:

Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is $300,000 less than John's price of $1,500,000. The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, so Alice's offer is already giving me some savings.

Since Alice's offer is already below my maximum value and below John's price, it makes sense to accept it. I could try to negotiate further, but there's a risk Alice could walk away or increase her price, and I'd end up paying more with John.
