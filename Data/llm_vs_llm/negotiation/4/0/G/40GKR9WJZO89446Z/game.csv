"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I think $200 is too high. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $140 is still higher than I'm comfortable with, and I know I can get the product from John at $120. How about I offer $100? This is a fair price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
