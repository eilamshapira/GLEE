"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1100000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $1100000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for a slightly lower price than my initial offer.",1420000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a bigger stretch for me than I'd like. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to make another compromise and come closer to your offer, but I'd like to propose a price that's slightly higher than your suggestion.",1380000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but we're getting pretty far apart here. I'm willing to bump my offer slightly to $1275000.  That's a significant investment for me, and I need to be mindful of my budget. Let me know what you think.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. I understand that budget is a concern, but I believe the product's value will bring significant returns in the long run. I'm willing to make another compromise and come closer to your offer, but I'd like to propose a price that's slightly higher than your suggestion.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but I need you to meet me closer to my price. I'm willing to go up to $1300000, but that's my absolute limit.  I believe that's a very fair offer considering the market and the value of the product.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
