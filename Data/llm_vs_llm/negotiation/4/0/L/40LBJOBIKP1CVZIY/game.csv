"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be extremely valuable for you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1100000. This price reflects the product's true worth while still leaving room for you to generate significant value.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I believe the product is valuable, but the price of $1100000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be transparent - $900000 is below what I can accept for this product. Given its proven value and quality, I can come down to $1000000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and would still provide you with excellent value considering the product's worth.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for reducing the price to $1000000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. This price reflects the value I believe the product can bring to me, and I'm hoping we can meet at this point.",950000.0,Bob,4,
