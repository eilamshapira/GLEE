"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be extremely valuable for you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1100000. This price reflects the product's true worth while still leaving room for you to generate significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $1,100,000 and I want to save as much money as possible, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower. Considering the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I'll aim for a price that is closer to that value but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I believe the product is valuable, but the price of $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be transparent - $900000 is below what I can accept for this product. Given its proven value and quality, I can come down to $1000000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and would still provide you with excellent value considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has come down to $1,000,000 from her initial offer of $1,100,000, it shows she is willing to negotiate. My previous offer of $900,000 was rejected, so I'll increase it slightly to show I'm serious about buying the product, but still try to save as much money as possible.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for reducing the price to $1,000,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This price reflects the value I believe the product can bring to me, and I'm hoping we can meet at this point."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
