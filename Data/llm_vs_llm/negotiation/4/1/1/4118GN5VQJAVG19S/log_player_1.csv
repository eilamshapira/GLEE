Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is considerably above my budget. Given market conditions and my valuation of the product, I can offer $800000. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
