"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am offering the product to you at a price of $1200000. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me
2. Alice's offer ($1,200,000) is higher than both my maximum value and John's price
3. John is offering the product at $1,000,000

The rational decision is to reject Alice's offer since it's significantly above both my maximum value and John's alternative price. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price, leaving room for negotiation while still being reasonable.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,200,000 is considerably above my budget. Given market conditions and my valuation of the product, I can offer $800,000. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your valuation, but I believe this product holds considerable additional value. I can lower my offer to $1100000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given that:
1. Alice's new offer ($1,100,000) is still higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000)
2. We've already gone through two rounds, and Alice's reduction was relatively small ($100,000)
3. John's offer ($1,000,000) is guaranteed and matches my maximum value

At this point, since Alice's price is still above both my maximum value and John's price, and she seems unlikely to drop the price significantly below $1,000,000 based on her negotiation pattern, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
