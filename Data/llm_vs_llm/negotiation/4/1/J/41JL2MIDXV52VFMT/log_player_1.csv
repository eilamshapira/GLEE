"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","That offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's not even close to being reasonable, so I'll reject and make a counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was very low at $50, but my initial offer of $250 was rejected, I'll lower my price but still maintain a strong position.

{""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's new offer of $75 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and he's only increasing his offers by small amounts. Given that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, and Bob seems unwilling to make reasonable offers, I'll take the sure deal with John.
