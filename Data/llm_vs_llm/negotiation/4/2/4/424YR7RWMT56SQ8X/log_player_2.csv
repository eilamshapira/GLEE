"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for a price of $250. If you're interested, please let me know and we can finalize the sale. If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to evaluate Alice's offer against my own constraints and alternatives.

The key facts:
- The product is worth no more than $150 to me
- Alice is offering it for $250
- John will sell me the same product for $150

Since Alice's offer ($250) exceeds both the value I place on the product ($150) and John's price ($150), accepting Alice's offer wouldn't be rational.
