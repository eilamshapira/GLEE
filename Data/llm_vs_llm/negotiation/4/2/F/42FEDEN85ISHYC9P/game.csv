"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product but $200 is too high for me. How about we settle at $100? That seems like a fair starting point.",100.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $100 is below my minimum price. I can go as low as $180 for the product. Let me know if that works for you!",180.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 might still be a bit high for you. How about we meet in the middle at $160? This is a good deal for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
