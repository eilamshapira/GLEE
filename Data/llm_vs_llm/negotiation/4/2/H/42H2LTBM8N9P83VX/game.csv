"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I believe $1100000 is too high. Given market conditions, I would be willing to purchase it for $900000, which I believe is a fair price that could work for both of us. How does that sound?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter.  I understand your perspective on the market, but $900000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1025000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground, Alice. Your product is indeed valuable, but I believe we can find a price that's even more mutually beneficial. I can offer $965000, which represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and would be fair value for both parties. Would you consider this?",965000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $965000 is closer to my bottom line, it's still a significant gap from what I had in mind. My final offer is $995000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",995000.0,Alice,5,
