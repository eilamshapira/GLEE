"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I know you've been looking at this product for a while, and I truly believe it could be a game-changer for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. It's an investment that will pay dividends. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

The reason for this decision is that the offered price of $1,100,000 exceeds the maximum amount I am willing to pay, which is $800,000. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $800,000, rejecting Alice's offer allows me to explore this more affordable alternative."
