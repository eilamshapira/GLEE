Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $2000000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, though. I'd like to propose a price that I think is more reasonable.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original offer. However, $1800000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I think this is a fair compromise.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to adjust the price. However, $1650000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to make a small concession to meet you closer to your offer, but I need to stay within my budget.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Hmm, this is a tough one. I'm starting to think Bob might not be willing to go much higher. I need to consider the risk of losing the deal entirely and ending up with only $1,000,000 from John. I have 4 more rounds to negotiate.

Given the incremental increase in Bob's offers, I'm going to make a calculated decision:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my next counteroffer. I'm being slightly more aggressive this time.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I'm getting close to my limit. I hope we can meet in the middle.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Okay, the offers are not increasing significantly. With only two rounds remaining, I must make a decisive move. I could make another counteroffer and potentially end up with nothing if Bob rejects. Alternatively, I could try to sell the product to John, where I am sure to get $1,000,000.

I'm going to take a gamble and attempt to get a better deal.

Given the risk of ending with zero, I'll accept Bob's offer.
