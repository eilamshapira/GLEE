"Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a special introductory price of $170. It's a fantastic deal, what do you think?",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $170 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to consider that?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand that my initial offer is higher than you expected, but $60 is simply too low for me. This product is truly worth the value, how about we meet in the middle at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and yours, so how about $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While $90 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't let it go for less than $105.  This is my final offer.",105.0,Alice,5,
