Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $170 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60

Round 4
Bob's offer:
