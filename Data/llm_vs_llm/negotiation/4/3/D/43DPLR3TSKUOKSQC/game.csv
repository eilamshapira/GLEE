"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $180 is quite a bit higher than I can pay. The product is worth about $120 to me, which happens to be the same price another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you consider $100 for the product?",100.0,Bob,2,
