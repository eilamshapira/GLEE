"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product. I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $180 is quite a bit higher than I can pay. The product is worth about $120 to me, which happens to be the same price another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you consider $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, considering Bob's offer of $100 and John's offer of $120, I have a clear choice.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
