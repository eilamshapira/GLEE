"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product. I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to analyze this offer. Alice is asking for $180, but the product is only worth $120 to me. 

Since I can always buy from John for $120, there's no reason to accept a price higher than that. Alice's current offer of $180 is significantly above my maximum value.

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as I can potentially get a better price from Alice than the $120 John is offering.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $180 is quite a bit higher than I can pay. The product is worth about $120 to me, which happens to be the same price another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to buy from you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you consider $100 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
