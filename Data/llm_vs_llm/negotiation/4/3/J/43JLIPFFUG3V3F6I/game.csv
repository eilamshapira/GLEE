"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While it is a nice product, I'm afraid $160 is still more than I'm willing to spend. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is still below my minimum price. I can go as low as $155, which is my final offer. Let me know if you can meet this price.",155.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're close, but I need to stick to my minimum. My final offer is $155. If this works for you, let's close the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other offers.",155.0,Alice,5,
