"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my premium product. Due to its quality and features, I'm setting the price at $150. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $80 and John's price of $80, it wouldn't be rational to accept this offer. While I could make a counteroffer, I already know I can get the product from John for $80, which is my maximum value. However, I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if I can get an even better deal from Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably lower but still gives room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is significantly above my budget. Given market prices and my research, I would be willing to pay $60 for the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget concerns, but considering the quality and uniqueness of this product, I can offer it to you for $100. Let me know if you can work with this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $100 is still above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing the price significantly from $150 to $100, it's still not better than my alternative option with John. Since I can get the product from John for $80, there's no reason to accept a higher price from Alice. I'll reject and make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my target price but still below John's price to try to get a better deal.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price. However, I have another seller offering the same product for $80. I would be willing to pay $70 for your product if you can match or beat that competing offer. This would save me some money while still giving you a fair price."", ""product_price"": 70}"
