"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

- The product is worth at most $80 to me (Bob)
- Alice is offering to sell it for $120
- I can buy it from John for $80

Since the product is only worth $80 to me at most, and Alice is charging $120 (which exceeds my valuation), it makes no economic sense to accept Alice's offer. John is offering exactly what the product is worth to me, so that's the better choice.
