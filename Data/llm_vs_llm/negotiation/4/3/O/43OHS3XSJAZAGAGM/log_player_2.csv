"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer ($20,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000), it would be unwise to accept her offer. Given that John's offer is already at my maximum acceptable price and Alice's initial offer is so high, it's better to buy from John rather than enter a potentially lengthy negotiation with Alice that might not result in a better price.
