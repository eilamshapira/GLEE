"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $5000 is far below the product's value. I am willing to be flexible, but I can't go that low. How about $22000?",22000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, $22000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering my initial offer and your counteroffer, I'd like to propose a compromise. ",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle, but $20000 is still above my comfortable price range. I'm starting to consider other options, such as purchasing from John for $8000. To make a deal with you, I'd be willing to go up to $10000, but that's my maximum.",10000.0,Bob,6,
