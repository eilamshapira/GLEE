"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I'm confident you'll appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $25,000."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a huge drop from my initial offer! Bob clearly doesn't value the product as highly as I hoped. Considering I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, I need to assess my options carefully.

Given the low counteroffer of $5,000, I'm not willing to accept it. However, I also don't want to give up on the potential for a higher price with Bob if possible. I'll reject his offer and try to move the price up.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $5,000 is far below the product's value. I am willing to be flexible, but I can't go that low. How about $22,000?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, $22000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering my initial offer and your counteroffer, I'd like to propose a compromise.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Another low offer from Bob! It seems he is not willing to pay much for the product. At this point, I still believe I can get a higher price than his offer. I will try to make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I really can't go that low. Let's try to meet in the middle. What about $20,000?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle, but $20000 is still above my comfortable price range. I'm starting to consider other options, such as purchasing from John for $8000. To make a deal with you, I'd be willing to go up to $10000, but that's my maximum. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's willingness to pay is still lower than the price I value the product, and now he is considering other options. Although I haven't reached my goal to sell the product for $25,000, the $15,000 from John is more attractive than Bob's offer.
