Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a reasonably high price to leave room for negotiation while still maintaining good profit potential.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","$50 is far too low - it's even below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Since I can guarantee $150 from John, there's no reason to accept such a low offer. However, I'll try one more counteroffer with Bob before considering selling to John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still maintain a price well above my minimum value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob has only increased his offer by $10, from $50 to $60, which is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Given that Bob's incremental increases are very small and he's still offering less than half of John's guaranteed price, it's time to end this negotiation and take the sure deal with John.
