{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Alice's offer. While $120 is my limit, I'm going to try and see if I can get a better price.  I'm going to try and negotiate with Alice first, and then I'll consider buying from John if I can't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to start by offering $90 for the product.  This is a significant discount from Alice's original price, but I believe it's still a fair price given my limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Alice's offer. While I was hoping for a lower price, $110 is still a good deal for me and within my budget. I'm happy to save $10 compared to buying from John."
