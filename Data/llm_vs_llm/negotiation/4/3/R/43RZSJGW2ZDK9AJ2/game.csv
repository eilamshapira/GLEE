"Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I believe $1000000 is too high for this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $600000. This is a fair price that provides good value for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $600000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer you the product for $850000. This price reflects the true value of this product and leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's make this deal happen!",850000.0,Alice,3,
