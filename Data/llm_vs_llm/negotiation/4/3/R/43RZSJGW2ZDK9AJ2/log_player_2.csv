"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1000000. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000, and it's also higher than John's guaranteed price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, starting lower to leave room for negotiation while keeping John's price as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I believe $1,000,000 is too high for this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $600,000. This is a fair price that provides good value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 600000}

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer at $600,000 for a few strategic reasons:
1. It gives room for negotiation while staying well below my maximum of $800,000
2. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, showing that I'm not willing to pay the premium she's asking
3. If Alice rejects this, we can potentially meet somewhere in the middle while still staying below John's price of $800,000"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $600000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer you the product for $850000. This price reflects the true value of this product and leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's new offer of $850,000 is still above John's price of $800,000, and above my maximum value, it makes the most sense to buy from John. Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate by dropping her price, but she's still asking for more than John's price. Given that John's offer is guaranteed and below Alice's current price, it's the most logical choice to end the negotiation and buy from John now."
