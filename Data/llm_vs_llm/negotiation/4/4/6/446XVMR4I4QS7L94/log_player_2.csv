"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you might be interested in.  I'm asking for $200 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given the information, Alice is offering the product for $200, but I know that the product is worth no more than $100 to me. John is willing to sell me the same product for $100, which matches my maximum valuation.

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both my valuation and John's alternative price. There's no reason to accept this offer. I could try to negotiate with Alice by rejecting and making a counteroffer, but since I already have a guaranteed option to buy from John at my maximum valuation ($100), the most logical decision is to simply buy from John.
