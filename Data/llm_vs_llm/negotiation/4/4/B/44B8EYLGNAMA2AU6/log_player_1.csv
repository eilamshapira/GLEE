"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","$60 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and it's significantly lower than my initial offer. Since I have John's guaranteed offer of $100, I won't accept anything lower than that. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, so I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still maintain a good margin above my minimum price of $100.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob has only increased his offer by $10 (from $60 to $70), which is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $100. Since he's not showing significant movement towards a reasonable price and we've already gone through 4 rounds, I'll take the guaranteed offer from John rather than risk more rounds of unproductive negotiation.
