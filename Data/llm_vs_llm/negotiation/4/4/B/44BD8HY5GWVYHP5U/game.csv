"Thanks for the offer Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit high for me right now.  How about we start at $5000?  Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $5000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $7000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $7000 is close, but I need a bit more to make this work. How about we split the difference at $7500?  It's a fair price for both of us.",7500.0,Alice,5,
