"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,499,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,499,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to evaluate this offer logically. 

Alice is offering the product for $1,499,999, which is actually $499,999 more than the product is worth to me (as the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me).

John is offering the same product for $1,000,000, which is exactly what the product is worth to me.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, I should choose the option that costs me less.
