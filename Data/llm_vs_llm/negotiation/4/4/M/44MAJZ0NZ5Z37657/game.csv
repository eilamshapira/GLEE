"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While the product looks great, $250 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand that $250 might be a bit steep, but I'm afraid $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my original price and your offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the willingness to compromise. How about we settle at $130? That feels like a fair deal to me.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me closer to the middle. However, I'm still a bit short of what I'm comfortable with. I can do $145, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If this doesn't work for you, I have another buyer lined up.",145.0,Alice,5,
