"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's initial offer is too high. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While the product looks great, $250 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes my budget constraints early."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand that $250 might be a bit steep, but I'm afraid $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my original price and your offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving in the right direction, $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'll try countering again, but stay closer to John's price as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the willingness to compromise. How about we settle at $130? That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

This counter-offer splits the difference between her latest offer and my previous one. It shows willingness to negotiate while still leaving some wiggle room before hitting my max budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me closer to the middle. However, I'm still a bit short of what I'm comfortable with. I can do $145, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If this doesn't work for you, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling this is her final offer. At $145, it's within my budget and saves me a bit of money compared to John.  It's a reasonable deal!"
