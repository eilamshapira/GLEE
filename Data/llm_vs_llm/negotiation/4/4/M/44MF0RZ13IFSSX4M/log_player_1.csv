Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has tremendous value, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects its worth. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 5000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, but I'm afraid $5000000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, considering the product's worth. I'd like to propose a price that I believe is more reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $900,000 is lower than my initial offer, and I believe the product is worth more. I'll try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 

My counteroffer: $4,500,000"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $900,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product's value is significantly higher. I'm willing to compromise and make a counteroffer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the reduction in price, but $4500000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to find a mutually agreeable price. I believe this new offer is more reasonable, considering the product's value and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Bob's new offer of $1,050,000 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and it's also higher than what John is willing to pay. Since the difference between Bob's offer and John's offer is relatively small, and I've already invested time in negotiating with Bob, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
