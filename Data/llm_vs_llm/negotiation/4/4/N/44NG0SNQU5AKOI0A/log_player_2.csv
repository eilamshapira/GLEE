"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $12,000 is already below my maximum budget of $15,000, it's a good starting point. However, I'd like to try to negotiate a better price to save as much money as possible.

My decision is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Alice a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, to see how she responds.

My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": $9,000}

This is a reasonable starting point for the negotiation, and it gives Alice room to consider a lower price while still being within my budget. Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice rejected my counteroffer and came back with a new offer of $10,500. This is still below my maximum budget of $15,000, but I'd like to try to negotiate a better price.

Since Alice's new offer is $2,500 higher than my previous counteroffer, I'll try to meet her halfway. I'll make a new counteroffer that is higher than my previous one, but still lower than Alice's new offer.

However, for now, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer and think about my next counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a new counteroffer that is higher than my previous one, but still lower than Alice's new offer of $10,500.

My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": $9,750}

This offer is $750 higher than my previous counteroffer of $9,000, which shows that I'm willing to negotiate and meet Alice halfway. At the same time, it's still $1,750 lower than Alice's current offer, so I'm hoping she'll consider it a reasonable compromise. Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice rejected my counteroffer again and came back with a new offer of $10,000. This is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but I still think I can do better.

Since Alice's new offer is only $250 lower than her previous offer of $10,500, and $250 higher than my previous counteroffer of $9,750, I'll try to split the difference again.

I'll choose to reject Alice's offer and make a new counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a new counteroffer that is higher than my previous one, but still lower than Alice's new offer of $10,000.

My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": $9,875}

This offer is $125 higher than my previous counteroffer of $9,750, which shows that I'm willing to continue negotiating and meeting Alice halfway. At the same time, it's still $125 lower than Alice's current offer, so I'm hoping she'll consider it a reasonable compromise. Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice rejected my counteroffer again and came back with a new offer of $9,950. This is getting very close to a price I'm comfortable with.

At this point, I've negotiated the price down from $12,000 to $9,950, which is a significant reduction. Considering that my next counteroffer would likely need to be very close to Alice's current offer, I think it's time to consider accepting her offer.

Accepting Alice's offer of $9,950 would save me $5,050 compared to buying from John for $15,000, which is a substantial savings.
