Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 
I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm offering $1,750,000. This is still significantly above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum value.  Since I can sell to John for $1,500,000, it's more advantageous to end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John."
