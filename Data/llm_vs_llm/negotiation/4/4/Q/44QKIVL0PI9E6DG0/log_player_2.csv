"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,500,000, it would be unwise to accept it. Additionally, buying from John for $1,500,000 is an option, but I'd like to try and negotiate a better price with Alice first. Therefore, the best course of action is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of reaching a mutually agreeable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range, considering my maximum budget is $1,500,000. A good starting point could be around $1,000,000, which gives room for negotiation while also being serious about purchasing the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,750,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. While it's a better offer than the initial $2,000,000, it's still not within my desired price range. Buying from John for $1,500,000 is becoming a more attractive option since it's within my budget, but I'd like to try and negotiate with Alice a bit more to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

Given that Alice has already come down from $2,000,000 to $1,750,000, it shows she is willing to negotiate. Therefore, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, hoping to bring the price down further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing the price from $2,000,000 to $1,750,000, my next counteroffer should be reasonable and slightly higher than my previous offer of $1,000,000, to demonstrate my seriousness about purchasing the product and to meet Alice halfway. Considering my maximum budget is $1,500,000 and Alice's last offer was $1,750,000, a logical counteroffer would be to split the difference or come close to my budget limit.
