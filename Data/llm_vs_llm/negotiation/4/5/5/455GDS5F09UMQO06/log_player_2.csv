"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer is at $150 (which is the same as John's price) and the product is worth $120 to her, I'll make a significantly lower counteroffer to start the negotiation.

{""product_price"": 125}

This offer gives Alice a small profit margin while being substantially better than her initial offer and John's price. It leaves room for negotiation if she counters."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down from $150 to $145, showing some flexibility, I'll increase my previous offer but still aim for a good deal.

{""product_price"": 130}

This offer gives Alice a reasonable $10 profit margin while still being significantly better than both her last offer ($145) and John's price ($150). It's a fair middle ground that could lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has gradually reduced her price from $150 to $145 to $140, showing she's willing to negotiate. I'll increase my offer to meet her partway.

{""product_price"": 135}

This offer splits the difference between our last positions ($130 and $140). It gives Alice a $15 profit margin, which is reasonable, while still saving me $15 compared to John's price. We're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."
