Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While the product sounds interesting, $150 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider selling it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
