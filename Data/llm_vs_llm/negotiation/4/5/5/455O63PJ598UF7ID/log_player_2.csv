"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $150. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and Alice is offering it for $150, I'm indifferent between buying from Alice and buying from John. To potentially save money, I will reject the offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While the product sounds interesting, $150 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider selling it for $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand $150 might be high for you, $120 is a bit low considering the product's value. I can offer it to you for $135, which I believe is a fair middle ground. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has lowered the price to $135. This is still within my acceptable range of $150, and it's lower than John's price. Therefore, I will accept this offer.
