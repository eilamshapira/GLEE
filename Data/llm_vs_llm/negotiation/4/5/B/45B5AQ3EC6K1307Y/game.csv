"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's quality and potential benefits it can bring to you.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget limitations.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $8000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's value and your interest, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $18000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still outside my budget. I'm committed to purchasing this product, but I can only offer $12000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the potential savings you'll get from a quick sale.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your commitment to purchasing the product, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still slightly above $12000. Considering the product's value and the progress we've made in our negotiations, I'd like to offer it to you for $16000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I understand you need a fair price, but I'm still stuck at $12000.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $14000.  This would allow both of us to walk away feeling like we got a good deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,
