"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's quality and potential benefits it can bring to you."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget limitations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and even lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I can potentially get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $8,000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's value and your interest, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $18,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still outside my budget. I'm committed to purchasing this product, but I can only offer $12000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the potential savings you'll get from a quick sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Although Bob's offer of $12,000 matches what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. Since Bob has shown a strong interest in the product and has increased his offer significantly, I believe there is still a possibility that he may be willing to pay a bit more. I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your commitment to purchasing the product, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still slightly above $12,000. Considering the product's value and the progress we've made in our negotiations, I'd like to offer it to you for $16,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I understand you need a fair price, but I'm still stuck at $12000.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $14000.  This would allow both of us to walk away feeling like we got a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $14,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offers, and it's above what John is willing to pay. Splitting the difference is a reasonable approach, and I believe $14,000 is a fair price considering the negotiations we've had. I'm willing to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
