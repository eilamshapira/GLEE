"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I think might be of interest to you. This product is worth $12000 in market value. I'm offering it to you at this price because it represents the fair market value. If you're interested in purchasing, please let me know. If not, I understand and have another buyer ready. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since the product is worth $12,000 to me and Alice is offering it at the same price, I don't see any room for negotiation. However, buying from Alice at this price or buying from John at the same price yields the same result for me - I pay $12,000. Given that I want to save as much money as possible and there's no discount offered by Alice, I might as well consider other options. But since the price is the same with John, and I don't have any other information about potential discounts or benefits from either seller, my decision would be based on the assumption that there are no additional costs or benefits from choosing one seller over the other.
