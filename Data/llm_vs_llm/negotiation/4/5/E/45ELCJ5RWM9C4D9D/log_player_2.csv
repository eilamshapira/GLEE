"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price offered by Alice ($1,200,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's alternative price ($800,000). It would be reasonable to reject this offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price. If Alice doesn't agree to a lower price, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 600000}

I'll offer $600,000, which is below John's price of $800,000. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to John's offer. If Alice counters with a price above $800,000, I can always go with John's offer, but this initial lower offer gives us room to negotiate upward while potentially getting a better deal than $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000). While Alice has reduced her price by $100,000, it's still not competitive with John's offer. I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer. If Alice doesn't come down to a more reasonable price, I can always take John's offer of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'll increase my offer to $700,000, which is a significant move up from my previous offer of $600,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate in good faith while still staying below John's price of $800,000. This gives Alice room to either accept or make one more reasonable counter while keeping my options open. If Alice still insists on a price above $800,000, I can always go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price that's competitive with John's offer. While Alice has reduced her price to $950,000, it's still significantly higher than John's fixed price of $800,000. Given that my maximum value for the product is $800,000, and Alice seems unlikely to match or beat John's price in future negotiations, the most rational decision is to end the negotiation with Alice and purchase from John at $800,000."
