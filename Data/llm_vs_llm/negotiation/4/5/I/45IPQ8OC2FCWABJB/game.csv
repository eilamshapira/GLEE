"Alice, your offer of $20000 is quite high. I'm very interested in the product but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. This is my final offer, but I'm happy to discuss it further.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product and for making an offer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to slightly negotiate, so I'll make a counteroffer of $18000. I'm open to further discussion but need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $8000. It's my final offer and reflects the value I'm willing to pay. If you're not comfortable with this, I'll have to move on to other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand that you have a budget in mind. However, I must reiterate that $8000 is below the product's value. I'm willing to make a significant concession from my previous offer, and I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and your offer. I'll make a counteroffer of $15000. If this is still not feasible for you, I may need to consider other options.",15000.0,Alice,5,
