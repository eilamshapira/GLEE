Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer of $20000 is quite high. I'm very interested in the product but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. This is my final offer, but I'm happy to discuss it further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. My counteroffer will be $18,000. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product and for making an offer. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to slightly negotiate, so I'll make a counteroffer of $18,000. I'm open to further discussion but need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.""}"
