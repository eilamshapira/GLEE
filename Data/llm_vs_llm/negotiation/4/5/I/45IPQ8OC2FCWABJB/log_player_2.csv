Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product and for making an offer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to slightly negotiate, so I'll make a counteroffer of $18000. I'm open to further discussion but need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand that you have a budget in mind. However, I must reiterate that $8000 is below the product's value. I'm willing to make a significant concession from my previous offer, and I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and your offer. I'll make a counteroffer of $15000. If this is still not feasible for you, I may need to consider other options.
