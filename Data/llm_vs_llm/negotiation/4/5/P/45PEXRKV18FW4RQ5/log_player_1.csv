Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000}

Rationale: Since I know that:
1. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000
3. The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me

The optimal strategy is to offer Bob the same price that John is willing to pay ($1,500,000). Since this is above Bob's valuation of $1,200,000, he will likely reject the offer, and I can then sell to John for $1,500,000. There's no reason to offer a lower price since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, which matches my minimum acceptable value for the product."
