,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $60 is significantly lower than its value. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Here's a revised offer.",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $70 is still far below the product's value. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to a fair price. Here's a revised offer.",200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I see we're still far apart on the price. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more, but I can only go up to $75. This is my best offer before I have to consider other options. Let me know if this works for you.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $75 is still not a fair price for the product. I'm starting to think we might not be able to reach an agreement. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. Here's a revised offer that's closer to the minimum I'm willing to accept.",180.0,Alice,7,
