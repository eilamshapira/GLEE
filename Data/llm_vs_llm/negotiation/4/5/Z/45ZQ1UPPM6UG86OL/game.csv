"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Considering the market and potential returns, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this price is more reasonable and still reflects the product's quality and value proposition.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your position. However, $1200000 is still below what I believe is fair given the product's value. I'm willing to come down from my initial price, but I believe $1350000 is a more reasonable figure. This price point still provides you with significant potential for returns while better reflecting the product's true market value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down from the initial price. However, I still believe $1350000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1275000. I believe this price is more reasonable and takes into account the product's value and potential returns.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
