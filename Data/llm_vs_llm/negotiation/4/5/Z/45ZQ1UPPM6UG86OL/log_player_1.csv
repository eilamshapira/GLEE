"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be extremely beneficial for you. Given its market value and potential returns, I'm offering it at $1,400,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Considering the market and potential returns, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this price is more reasonable and still reflects the product's quality and value proposition. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $1,200,000 is still too low considering the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000). There's room for negotiation between our positions, and I still have several rounds to reach a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your position. However, $1,200,000 is still below what I believe is fair given the product's value. I'm willing to come down from my initial price, but I believe $1,350,000 is a more reasonable figure. This price point still provides you with significant potential for returns while better reflecting the product's true market value."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down from the initial price. However, I still believe $1350000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1275000. I believe this price is more reasonable and takes into account the product's value and potential returns. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,275,000. This is a reasonable compromise that provides good value for both parties. The price is significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and while it's below my initial target, it represents a fair deal considering the negotiation progress and the risk of potentially losing the deal if we continue haggling. The price point allows Bob to still make a profit while giving me a substantial return above my alternative option with John."
