"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great asset for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential value to you."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $14000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $12,000 is too low considering the product's value to Bob ($15,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($10,000). There's still room for negotiation to find a price point that works better for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot go that low. The product's quality and market value justify a higher price. I can reduce my initial asking price to $13,200, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value this product will bring to you."", ""product_price"": 13200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $12,500. While it's lower than my initial target, it's still a good margin above my minimum price of $10,000, and we're at round 4 already. Continuing the negotiation might risk losing the deal, and $12,500 represents a reasonable compromise that's better than my fallback option with John."
