"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product today. Given its quality and market value, I'm listing it at $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. I'd be happy to discuss the details with you.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $15000 is significantly above my budget. I am interested in purchasing the product, but I can only offer $7000 at this time.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but I'm afraid $7000 is below what I can accept for this item. The product is worth at least $10000 based on market value, and that's my absolute minimum. I can come down to $12500 from my initial offer, which I believe is quite reasonable considering the quality and value you'll receive. Would you be able to meet me somewhere in that range?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for coming down on the price. I understand the value you place on the product. However, my maximum budget is $10000, and I'm also considering an alternative offer at that price. Would you consider $8500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increase in your offer. However, I have a standing offer from another buyer (John) at $10000, which represents the minimum value I can accept for this product. Given that you're also considering an alternative at that price point, I think $10000 is fair market value. I'm willing to sell to you at exactly $10000 - the same as my other offer - because I'd prefer to do business with you. This is truly my bottom line as I cannot sell for less than what I have guaranteed elsewhere.",10000.0,Alice,5,
