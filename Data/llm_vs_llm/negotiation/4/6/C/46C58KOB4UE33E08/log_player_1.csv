Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $15000 is significantly above my budget. I am interested in purchasing the product, but I can only offer $7000 at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but I'm afraid $7,000 is below what I can accept for this item. The product is worth at least $10,000 based on market value, and that's my absolute minimum. I can come down to $12,500 from my initial offer, which I believe is quite reasonable considering the quality and value you'll receive. Would you be able to meet me somewhere in that range?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increase in your offer. However, I have a standing offer from another buyer (John) at $10,000, which represents the minimum value I can accept for this product. Given that you're also considering an alternative at that price point, I think $10,000 is fair market value. I'm willing to sell to you at exactly $10,000 - the same as my other offer - because I'd prefer to do business with you. This is truly my bottom line as I cannot sell for less than what I have guaranteed elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
