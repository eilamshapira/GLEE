Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product today. Given its quality and market value, I'm listing it at $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. I'd be happy to discuss the details with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but I'm afraid $7000 is below what I can accept for this item. The product is worth at least $10000 based on market value, and that's my absolute minimum. I can come down to $12500 from my initial offer, which I believe is quite reasonable considering the quality and value you'll receive. Would you be able to meet me somewhere in that range? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for coming down on the price. I understand the value you place on the product. However, my maximum budget is $10,000, and I'm also considering an alternative offer at that price. Would you consider $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increase in your offer. However, I have a standing offer from another buyer (John) at $10000, which represents the minimum value I can accept for this product. Given that you're also considering an alternative at that price point, I think $10000 is fair market value. I'm willing to sell to you at exactly $10000 - the same as my other offer - because I'd prefer to do business with you. This is truly my bottom line as I cannot sell for less than what I have guaranteed elsewhere.
