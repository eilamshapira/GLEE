Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll prepare an offer for Bob.

Looking at the situation, I need to determine a price that maximizes my potential earnings while still being potentially acceptable to Bob.

If Bob rejects my offer, I'm guaranteed $120 from John. This means any price I offer Bob should be higher than $120, since there's no advantage in offering less.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll set a price that gives me a meaningful premium over my guaranteed alternative while still being potentially reasonable to Bob.
