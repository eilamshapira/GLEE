"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is significantly higher than my maximum value of $15,000 and also higher than John's price. It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Even if negotiations fail, I can always buy from John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 12000}

I'll offer $12,000, which is significantly below John's price of $15,000. This gives some room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to buying from John. If Alice rejects this offer, we can still negotiate upward while staying below $15,000, or ultimately go with John's offer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $18,000 is still higher than John's price of $15,000 and above my maximum value. While Alice has reduced the price from the initial $20,000, it's still not competitive with John's offer. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, as we still have several rounds remaining to reach a better deal. If we can't reach an agreement below $15,000, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 13000}

I'll increase my previous offer to $13,000. This shows some flexibility and movement from my previous offer of $12,000, while still maintaining a good margin below John's price of $15,000. This gives Alice room to counter while keeping the negotiation moving in a constructive direction. We still have several rounds left, and if Alice doesn't accept, we can continue negotiating or ultimately go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($16,500) is still above John's price ($15,000)
2. While Alice has been gradually reducing her price, she's still not beating John's offer
3. Even though we have more rounds available, there's no guarantee Alice will go below $15,000
4. Since $15,000 is my maximum value for the product anyway, and John is offering exactly that price, it makes sense to take the sure deal rather than continue negotiating

Therefore, I'll end the negotiation with Alice and buy from John for $15,000."
