"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $100 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($80), but lower than my initial offer ($140), I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $130.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new offer is: {""product_price"": 130}"

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $110 is still lower than my previous counteroffer ($130), but getting closer, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer again and make another counteroffer.

My new counteroffer will be $120, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $115 is getting very close to my previous counteroffer ($120), and I want to maximize my earnings, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer again and make another counteroffer.

My new counteroffer will be $117.50, which is a small concession from my previous offer, hoping to meet Bob's willingness to pay.
