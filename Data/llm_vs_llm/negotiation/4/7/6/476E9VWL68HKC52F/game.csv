"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. How about I offer you $80 instead?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob, but $80 is a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. I can see that you're interested in the product, so I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $130 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to go any lower? How about $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $85 is still not enough for me to let go of this product. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we do $125?",125.0,Alice,5,

"I understand, Alice. Let's meet halfway between my last offer and your new price. How about $95?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I see we're getting closer, Bob. Meeting halfway is a good idea, but I still need to get a bit closer to my target price. How about we do $115? I think that's a fair compromise.",115.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"We're definitely getting closer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference again and settle on $100?",100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Splitting the difference again is a good idea, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $100. I'll tell you what - I'll meet you halfway between $100 and my last offer of $115. How about we do $107.50?",107.5,Alice,9,
