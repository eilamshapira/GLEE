Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I'm looking to purchase the product at a more reasonable price. How about $12000?

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a middle ground that's closer to my initial offer. 

My counteroffer: $13,500. This price still gives Bob a good deal, considering the product's value to him is $15,000, while also ensuring I get a fair price for the product."

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Since Bob's last offer was $12,500, I'll try to meet him closer to that price while still aiming to get as much value as possible for the product.

My counteroffer: $12,750. This price is slightly above Bob's last offer, indicating that I'm willing to negotiate further but still need to ensure I get a good deal."
