"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $150. It's a great value and I think you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I notice that Alice is offering me the product for $150, but it's only worth $120 to me. Additionally, John is willing to sell me the same product for $120.

Since the product is worth a maximum of $120 to me, I should not pay more than that. Alice's price of $150 exceeds my maximum value, so it wouldn't make financial sense to accept her offer.

John's offer matches exactly what the product is worth to me, so that's the better choice.
