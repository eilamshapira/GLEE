"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I'm willing to sell it for $1500000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value ($800,000) and also much higher than John's price ($800,000). It would be wise to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. If negotiations with Alice don't lead to a better price, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I know the market value of similar products, and I can actually get this product elsewhere for $800,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $600,000 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
