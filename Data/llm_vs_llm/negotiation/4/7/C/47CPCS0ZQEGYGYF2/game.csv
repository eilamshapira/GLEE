"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out with this product. However, $12000 is quite high for my budget. I know there are similar products on the market for less. I'd be comfortable paying $10500 for it. This would give you a nice profit while helping me stay within my budget constraints. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, and I'm glad you're interested in the product. Considering the quality and potential value it can bring to you, how about we meet in the middle at $11000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
