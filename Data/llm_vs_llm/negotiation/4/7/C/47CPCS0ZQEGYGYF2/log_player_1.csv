Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out with this product. However, $12000 is quite high for my budget. I know there are similar products on the market for less. I'd be comfortable paying $10500 for it. This would give you a nice profit while helping me stay within my budget constraints. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
