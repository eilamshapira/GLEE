"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your interest in acquiring the product at a competitive price. However, given the unique value this product offers, I am willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1050000? I believe this price fairly reflects the product's worth and your keen interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.

"Bob, I appreciate your budget constraints and your continued interest in the product. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to lower the price to $1000000. This reflects a significant concession on my part while still recognizing the high value of the product. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
