"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer of $110 is higher than my budget of $80, and I have the option to buy the product from John for $80, I will reject Alice's offer.

However, I'm willing to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. So, I'll choose option 2 and proceed to the next round.

My response is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's reasonable and within my budget. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower price.

My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $100 is still higher than my budget of $80, but it's closer than her initial offer of $110.

Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $80, I'm not willing to accept Alice's offer of $100. However, I'm still interested in negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

I'll choose option 2 and proceed to the next round, hoping to get a better deal from Alice.

My response is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer was $100, and I previously offered $60, I'll try to meet her halfway and make a more reasonable counteroffer.

My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $95 is still higher than my budget of $80, but it's getting closer.

However, since I can buy the product from John for $80, which is still lower than Alice's offer, I'm not willing to accept $95. I'll try to negotiate further to see if Alice can give me a better deal.

I'll choose option 2 and proceed to the next round, hoping to get a better offer from Alice.

My response is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer was $95, and I previously offered $70, I'll try to make a more reasonable counteroffer that's closer to my budget of $80.

My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $90 is still higher than my budget of $80, but it's getting closer to what I'm willing to pay.

However, since I can buy the product from John for $80, which is still lower than Alice's offer, I'm not willing to accept $90. At this point, I'm starting to think that buying from John might be the better option, but I'll try to negotiate with Alice one more time to see if she can give me a better deal.

I'll choose option 2 and proceed to the next round, but if Alice doesn't come down in price significantly, I'll likely choose to buy from John.

My response is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer was $90, and I'm running out of rounds to negotiate, I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my budget of $80, but still slightly higher than my previous offer of $75.

My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": 78}"
