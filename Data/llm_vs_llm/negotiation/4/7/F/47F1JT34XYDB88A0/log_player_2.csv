"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $120. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider Alice's offer of $120 for the product. The product is worth no more than $150 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $150.

Alice's offer of $120 is $30 less than John's price and within my valuation threshold. This is a good deal that would save me money compared to buying from John.
