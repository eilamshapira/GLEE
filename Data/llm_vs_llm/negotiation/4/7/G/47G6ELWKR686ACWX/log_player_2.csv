"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given the information, let me analyze my options:

1. Accept Alice's offer of $100
2. Reject and make a counteroffer
3. Buy from John for $120

The product is worth up to $120 to me, so I should definitely not pay more than that. John's price is $120, which is the maximum I would pay, but Alice is offering $100, which is better. 

I could try to negotiate with Alice for an even better price since the product is only worth $80 to her. However, there's no guarantee she'll accept a lower offer, and the negotiation could go back and forth.

Since Alice's current offer of $100 is already saving me $20 compared to John's price, and it's below my maximum valuation, I'll accept it.
