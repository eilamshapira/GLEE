Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine the right price to offer Bob.

Bob values the product at $1,200,000, but it's worth at least $1,500,000 to me. If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell to John for $1,500,000.

Since I already have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), there's no reason for me to sell to Bob for less than this amount. If I offer Bob any price at or above $1,500,000, he will reject it since it exceeds his valuation of $1,200,000. This is actually fine for me because I can then sell to John for $1,500,000.

Therefore, my optimal strategy is to offer Bob a price that ensures I get $1,500,000 either way.
