"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a special offer for you on this product. Given its value to you, I'm offering it at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider which option will save me the most money:

1. Accept Alice's offer: Pay $140
2. Reject Alice's offer: This means I'll buy from John for $150
3. Buy from John for $150

The product is worth up to $150 to me, and Alice is offering it at $140, which is $10 less than John's price. Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice.
