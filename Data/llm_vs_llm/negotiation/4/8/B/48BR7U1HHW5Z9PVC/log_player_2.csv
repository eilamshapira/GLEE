"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to consider my options carefully here:

1. Alice's offer is $11,000
2. The product is worth up to $12,000 to me
3. I could buy from John for $12,000, but that's the maximum I'm willing to pay
4. The product costs Alice $8,000, so she has room to negotiate

Since Alice's offer ($11,000) is already below my maximum value ($12,000), it's better than buying from John. However, since I know Alice's cost is $8,000, I can likely negotiate a better price rather than accepting immediately.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know the product costs Alice $8,000 and is worth up to $12,000 to me, I'll make a counteroffer that gives both of us some benefit. Alice has room to negotiate down from her initial $11,000 offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I see that Alice has moved down from her initial $11,000 to $10,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is still better than John's price of $12,000, but I think there's still room for a better deal considering Alice's cost is $8,000.

Since Alice has reduced her price by $500, it shows she's flexible. I should continue negotiating rather than accepting immediately or buying from John at the higher price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has come down further to $10,200, which shows she's still willing to negotiate. She's now dropped $800 from her initial offer. The negotiation is moving in a positive direction, and this price is significantly better than John's $12,000.

Since we've had a few rounds of negotiation and Alice has continued to lower her price, I think I can try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet closer to the middle.
