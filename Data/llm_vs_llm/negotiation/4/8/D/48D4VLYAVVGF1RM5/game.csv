"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $750000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. The product's value far exceeds that figure. However, I'm willing to move down from my initial offer. How about $2750000?",2750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but we're still quite far apart on price.  I can go up to $1000000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I need to see a reasonable return.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position as well. We are indeed apart, but let's try to bridge the gap. While $1000000 is still too low, I'm prepared to come down further. How about $2500000?",2500000.0,Alice,5,
