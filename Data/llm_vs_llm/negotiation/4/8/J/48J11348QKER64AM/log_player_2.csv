"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,200,000, and also higher than John's price. It would be better to reject this offer and make a counteroffer to Alice. If we can't reach a deal below $1,200,000, I can always buy from John later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than my maximum value, which gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to John's price.

{""product_price"": 800000}

This counteroffer of $800,000 is reasonably below my maximum value of $1,200,000 and John's price. This gives room for negotiation upward while potentially achieving a better deal than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,500,000 is still above both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000). While Alice has reduced her price from the initial $1,800,000, it's still not competitive with John's offer. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, as there's still room for negotiation. If we can't reach a deal below $1,200,000, I can still take John's offer later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still keep it well below John's price to maintain room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 950000}

This counteroffer of $950,000 shows some movement from my previous offer of $800,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still staying significantly below my maximum value and John's price. This gives Alice room to counter while potentially getting a better deal than John's $1,200,000 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($1,350,000) is still above John's price ($1,200,000)
2. While Alice has been coming down in price ($1,800,000 → $1,500,000 → $1,350,000), the rate of decrease suggests it might take several more rounds to get below John's price, if at all
3. We've already used half of our available rounds, and there's no guarantee Alice will ever go below John's price
4. John's price is already at my maximum value ($1,200,000)

Therefore, it's most prudent to take John's guaranteed offer rather than risk more rounds of negotiation with Alice that might not lead to a better outcome."
