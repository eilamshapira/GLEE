"Hi Alice, while I appreciate the quality of the product, the price of $2000000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $1000000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand my initial offer might have been high, so I'm willing to adjust it to $1600000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial price and better reflects the product's true market value. Would this work for you?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the revised offer, Alice. However, $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
