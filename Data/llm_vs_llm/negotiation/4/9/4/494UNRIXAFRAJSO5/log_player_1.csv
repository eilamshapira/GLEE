"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and potential value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while I appreciate the quality of the product, the price of $2000000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 (which is what John is willing to pay), but I'll continue negotiating with Bob as there might be room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand my initial offer might have been high, so I'm willing to adjust it to $1,600,000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial price and better reflects the product's true market value. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the revised offer, Alice. However, $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. Let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll choose to sell to John for $1,200,000. Bob's latest offer of $1,100,000 is still below John's guaranteed offer, and based on Bob's negotiation pattern and statement about his budget limitations, it seems unlikely he'll exceed $1,200,000. It's better to take the sure deal with John rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might not yield a better result."
