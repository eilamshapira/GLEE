Send your offer to Bob.,"Since I know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob and no less than $15,000 to me, it would not be rational to sell to Bob for less than $15,000 (as I can always sell to John for that price). However, I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is well below both my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and even below his own valuation ($12,000), I will reject this offer. However, given that Bob's offer is so low and he rejected my initial high offer, it seems unlikely we'll reach a deal that's better than my guaranteed option with John. Therefore, I'll take the sure deal with John.
