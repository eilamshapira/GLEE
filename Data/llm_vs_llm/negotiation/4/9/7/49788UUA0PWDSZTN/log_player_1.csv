Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. I know the product is worth at least $120 to me, and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $120. Since I don't know Bob's maximum willingness to pay, I should offer a price significantly above $120 to maximize my potential profit, while still keeping it reasonable enough that Bob might accept.
