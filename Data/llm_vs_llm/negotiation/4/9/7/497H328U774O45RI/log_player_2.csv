"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer is for $15,000, which is the same price that John is offering and is also the maximum amount I'm willing to pay for the product, there's no advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately. I could try to negotiate for a better price by making a counteroffer in the next round.
