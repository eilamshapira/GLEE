"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $11500 is quite high considering the market value. I'd like to propose $10500, which would still give you a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $11000? It's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
