Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $11500 is quite high considering the market value. I'd like to propose $10500, which would still give you a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
