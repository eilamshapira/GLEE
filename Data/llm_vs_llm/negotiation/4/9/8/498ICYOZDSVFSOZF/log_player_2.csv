"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $11500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the situation:
1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $11,500
3. John's fixed price is $12,000
4. Alice's cost is $10,000, so there's room for negotiation

Alice's initial offer of $11,500 is better than John's price ($12,000), but still seems high considering Alice's cost. Since we have 10 rounds of negotiation, it's worth trying to get a better price from Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's above Alice's cost but significantly lower than her initial offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $11,500 is quite high considering the market value. I'd like to propose $10,500, which would still give you a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $11000? It's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:
1. She's dropped from $11,500 to $11,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. $11,000 is still considerably lower than John's price ($12,000)
3. It's a $1,000 profit for Alice (from her $10,000 cost)
4. While we might get a slightly better price, the offer is quite reasonable

Given that:
- We've already negotiated down $500
- $11,000 represents a fair middle ground
- There's risk in pushing too hard when we have a reasonable offer
- It's a $1,000 savings compared to John's price
