"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $18000, which represents excellent value considering its features and benefits. Let me know if you're interested.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $18000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to start at $14000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand you'd like a better price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $14000 is too low considering the quality and value of this product. I can come down to $16500, which I believe is a fair compromise. This product has exceptional features and durability that make it worth the investment. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16500 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15500, which is a fair compromise given my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can close the deal here.",15500.0,Bob,4,
