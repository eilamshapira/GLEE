"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offer is $1,400,000
2. John's price is $1,500,000 (this is my upper limit and worst-case scenario)
3. I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice
4. There's room for negotiation since Alice's offer ($1,400,000) is significantly above her value ($1,200,000)

Since Alice's current offer is already $100,000 less than John's price, and I know there's potential room for negotiation (as Alice has a $200,000 margin between her value and current offer), it makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's strategically positioned between Alice's cost ($1,200,000) and her current offer ($1,400,000):

{""product_price"": 1250000}

This counteroffer is reasonable because:
1. It's $50,000 above Alice's value, so she can still make a profit
2. It's significantly lower than her initial offer of $1,400,000
3. It's well below John's price of $1,500,000, giving room for negotiation if Alice counters
4. It leaves room for future negotiation if needed"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has moved down from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This is still $150,000 less than John's price ($1,500,000)
3. It's $150,000 above Alice's value ($1,200,000)
4. While we could try another counteroffer, there's a risk of Alice becoming less flexible

The offer is reasonable given:
- Alice has made a significant move from her initial price
- The price is considerably better than John's alternative
- Further negotiation might risk the deal while not gaining much more value

At this point, accepting the offer seems like a prudent choice. We've achieved a good discount from both the initial offer and John's price.
