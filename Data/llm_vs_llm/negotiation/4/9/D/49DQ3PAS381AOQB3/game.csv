"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'd be happy to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, and while $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $200. I believe this product is truly worth it, and I'd be happy to discuss its value further.",200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $150?  It's a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
