(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's initial offer of $145 is close to my maximum budget of $150, but still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, I'll choose to reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try and negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, to give us room for negotiation. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a price that is lower than what I'm willing to pay, and see how Alice responds.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $135 is more reasonable, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since I have 8 rounds left, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer to try and bring the price down further.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous offer, to show that I'm willing to compromise and meet Alice halfway. I'll aim for a price that is still lower than Alice's current offer, but higher than my previous counteroffer.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $130 is getting closer to my target price, but I still think I can do better. Since Alice has already come down from $145 to $130, I'm hoping she'll be willing to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer to try and bring the price down to around $120, which I think is a fair price.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than the price I think Alice is willing to accept, which is around $120. I'll offer $122, which is still lower than Alice's current offer of $130, but close enough to show that I'm serious about making a deal.
