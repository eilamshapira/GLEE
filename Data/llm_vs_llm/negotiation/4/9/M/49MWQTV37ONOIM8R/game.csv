"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to consider that?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a better price. Let me think for a moment... How about we meet not exactly in the middle between my original offer and your counteroffer, but somewhere closer to what I was thinking? I can offer you the product for $150.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for your new proposal of $150. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer of $60 and your new offer of $150. That would put us at $105. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for that price?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your new offer of $105. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get a bit closer to my original price. How about we meet at $135? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I understand that $105 was not acceptable, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. Considering that I can buy the product from John for $80, I'm willing to make a slightly higher offer to you. How about $120? It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but still significantly lower than your original price. I think it's a fair compromise.",120.0,Bob,6,
