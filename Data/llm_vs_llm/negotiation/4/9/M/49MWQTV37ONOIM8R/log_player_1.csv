Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for your new proposal of $150. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer of $60 and your new offer of $150. That would put us at $105. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your new offer of $105. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I understand that $105 was not acceptable, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. Considering that I can buy the product from John for $80, I'm willing to make a slightly higher offer to you. How about $120? It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but still significantly lower than your original price. I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $120 is the same as what I can get from John, and considering that further negotiations may not yield a better price, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $120."
