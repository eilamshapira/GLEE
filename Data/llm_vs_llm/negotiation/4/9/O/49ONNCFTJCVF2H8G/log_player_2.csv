"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I believe it's worth a premium price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14999, which is a competitive offer considering its worth. If you're interested, please let me know and we can finalize the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $15,000
2. Alice's offer is $14,999
3. John's fixed price is $15,000
4. Alice's offer saves me $1 compared to John's price

While the savings is minimal ($1), it's still better than buying from John. Since Alice's offer is within my maximum value and is lower than John's price, I should accept it.
