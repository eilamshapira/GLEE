"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional quality and the value it brings, I'm initially offering it for $25000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my research and needs, this product is worth no more than $15000 to me, which happens to be the price another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'd like to offer $10000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However, $10000 is lower than I can accept. While I value your business, I also know the true worth of this product. Let's meet in the middle. How about $22000?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice, but $22000 is still well above what I can justify spending on this product. As I mentioned, I have a firm alternative offer from John at $15000, which matches my maximum budget for this item. However, I'd still prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer $12500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and provides you with a guaranteed sale today. Any price above $15000 simply doesn't make economic sense for me since I have that guaranteed alternative.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints and appreciate you considering my product. Given your alternative offer, I'm willing to come down further. How about $19000? This reflects a significant adjustment on my end while still recognizing the unique value my product provides. Let me know what you think.",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on your price, Alice. You're moving in the right direction, but $19000 is still more than I can pay for this product. I need to be clear: this product is worth no more than $15000 to me, which is exactly what John is offering. I'm willing to match that price with you at $15000 because I'd prefer to do business with you. This is my best offer - it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay based on the product's value to me and the alternative I have available. I hope we can close this deal today.",15000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your firm offer. I understand your position. I'm willing to meet you closer to your valuation. Let's try $17000. This is a significant move on my part to secure the deal with you.",17000.0,Alice,7,
