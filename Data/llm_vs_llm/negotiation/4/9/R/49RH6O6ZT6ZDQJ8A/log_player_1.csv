Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my research and needs, this product is worth no more than $15000 to me, which happens to be the price another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'd like to offer $10000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However, $10,000 is lower than I can accept.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice, but $22000 is still well above what I can justify spending on this product. As I mentioned, I have a firm alternative offer from John at $15000, which matches my maximum budget for this item. However, I'd still prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer $12500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and provides you with a guaranteed sale today. Any price above $15000 simply doesn't make economic sense for me since I have that guaranteed alternative. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints and appreciate you considering my product. Given your alternative offer, I'm willing to come down further. How about $19,000? This reflects a significant adjustment on my end while still recognizing the unique value my product provides. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on your price, Alice. You're moving in the right direction, but $19000 is still more than I can pay for this product. I need to be clear: this product is worth no more than $15000 to me, which is exactly what John is offering. I'm willing to match that price with you at $15000 because I'd prefer to do business with you. This is my best offer - it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay based on the product's value to me and the alternative I have available. I hope we can close this deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000.
