"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional quality and the value it brings, I'm initially offering it for $25000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's initial offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than my maximum valuation of $15,000 and also higher than John's guaranteed price of $15,000. Since I won't pay more than what the product is worth to me, and there's already a guaranteed alternative at my maximum price point, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25,000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my research and needs, this product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, which happens to be the price another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'd like to offer $10,000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without the hassle of finding another buyer."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However, $10000 is lower than I can accept. While I value your business, I also know the true worth of this product. Let's meet in the middle. How about $22000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has lowered her offer to $22,000, but this is still significantly above both my maximum valuation ($15,000) and John's guaranteed price ($15,000). Since Alice's counteroffer is well above my threshold, I'll reject it and make another counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice, but $22,000 is still well above what I can justify spending on this product. As I mentioned, I have a firm alternative offer from John at $15,000, which matches my maximum budget for this item. However, I'd still prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer $12,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and provides you with a guaranteed sale today. Any price above $15,000 simply doesn't make economic sense for me since I have that guaranteed alternative."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints and appreciate you considering my product. Given your alternative offer, I'm willing to come down further. How about $19000? This reflects a significant adjustment on my end while still recognizing the unique value my product provides. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $19,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this price is still $4,000 higher than both my maximum valuation and John's guaranteed price of $15,000. Since I can get the same product for $15,000 from John, and the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on your price, Alice. You're moving in the right direction, but $19,000 is still more than I can pay for this product. I need to be clear: this product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, which is exactly what John is offering. I'm willing to match that price with you at $15,000 because I'd prefer to do business with you. This is my best offer - it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay based on the product's value to me and the alternative I have available. I hope we can close this deal today."", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your firm offer. I understand your position. I'm willing to meet you closer to your valuation. Let's try $17000. This is a significant move on my part to secure the deal with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $17,000, which is closer but still $2,000 more than both my maximum valuation and John's guaranteed price. Since the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed option to buy it at exactly that price, paying $17,000 would be irrational. At this point, I should choose to buy from John rather than continue negotiating with Alice, as she seems unwilling to meet my maximum price point.
