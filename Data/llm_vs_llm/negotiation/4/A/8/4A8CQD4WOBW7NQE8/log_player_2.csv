"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $110. It's a fantastic deal considering its value and quality. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this strategically:
1. The product is worth $80 to Alice
2. I value it at no more than $120
3. John is willing to sell it for $120 (my backup option)
4. Alice's offer is $110

Alice's offer of $110 is better than John's price of $120, but since I know the product is worth $80 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably higher than Alice's cost ($80) but significantly lower than her initial offer ($110):

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, I've done some market research and I believe $90 would be a fair price for this product. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more competitive in the market. Would you accept this offer?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $100, which I think is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Alice has reduced her price from $110 to $100
2. This shows she's willing to negotiate
3. The price is now $20 less than John's price
4. While there might still be room for negotiation, $100 is a reasonable price given:
   - It's $20 below my maximum value ($120)
   - It gives Alice a fair profit ($20 above her cost)
   - There's a risk that if I push too hard, we might not reach a deal

Given this analysis, I'll accept this offer. It's a fair compromise and represents a good savings compared to buying from John.
