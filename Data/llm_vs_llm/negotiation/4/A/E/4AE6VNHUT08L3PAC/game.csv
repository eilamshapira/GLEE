"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $19500 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to purchase the product for $12000, considering it aligns with the value I place on it. Please let me know if this works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit low for us. Considering your budget and the value of the product, we're willing to lower our price to $18000. This ensures that both parties benefit from the deal. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. However, $18000 is still above what I'm willing to spend. I understand the value of the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we settle at $13000? This should be a fair compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. However, $13000 is still a bit low for us. In an effort to meet you halfway, we're willing to lower our price to $16500. This price reflects the value and quality of the product while considering your budget. What do you say to this offer?",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16500 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $14000, which I believe is a fair price considering both our needs. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,6,
