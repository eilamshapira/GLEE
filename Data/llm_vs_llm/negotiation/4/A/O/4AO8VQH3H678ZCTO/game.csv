"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget concerns, $105 is lower than I can go considering the value of this item. I can come down to $110, which still gives you a good deal on something worth considerably more. Does that work for you?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm really trying to stay within my budget. Could you go any lower, perhaps to $107?",107.0,Bob,4,
