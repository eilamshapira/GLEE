"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,200,000 and also higher than John's price. It would be better to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Since I know I can always get the product from John for $1,200,000, I shouldn't accept any price higher than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer significantly below my maximum price to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to appear unreasonable.

{""product_price"": 900000}

This counteroffer of $900,000 is:
1. Well below John's price of $1,200,000, giving me room to negotiate upward if needed
2. Not so low as to be insulting or cause Alice to break off negotiations
3. If accepted, would save me $300,000 compared to buying from John

I'll wait to see Alice's response and adjust my strategy based on how strongly she reacts to this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has reduced her price by $200,000 from her initial offer, but $1,600,000 is still significantly higher than John's price of $1,200,000. There's no reason to accept a price higher than what I can get from John. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, moving my price up slightly to show willingness to negotiate but still staying below John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer to show good faith in negotiating, but still maintain a price well below John's option.

{""product_price"": 1000000}

This counteroffer of $1,000,000:
1. Shows movement from my previous offer of $900,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate
2. Still leaves me significant savings compared to John's price of $1,200,000
3. Maintains room for further negotiation if needed
4. Signals to Alice that while I'm willing to increase my offer, I won't go anywhere near her $1,600,000 price point

Let's see how Alice responds to this more moderate increase."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has only reduced her price by $100,000 to $1,500,000, which is still $300,000 more than John's price. While she's showing some flexibility, there's no reason for me to accept a price higher than my alternative option of $1,200,000. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, continuing to work toward a more reasonable price point.

The negotiation seems to be moving slowly, and we're halfway through our rounds, but it's still worth trying to get a better price than John's offer while we have time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer again to show continued good faith, but still stay well under John's price.

{""product_price"": 1100000}

This counteroffer of $1,100,000:
1. Shows another meaningful increase from my last offer of $1,000,000
2. Gets closer to John's price but still leaves me $100,000 in potential savings
3. Signals to Alice that I'm serious about making a deal but won't go above John's price
4. With only 4 rounds remaining after this, this increase shows urgency to reach an agreement

If Alice rejects this, I might need to consider either making one final offer close to John's price or simply taking John's option, depending on how she responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice continues to move down in small increments, now at $1,400,000, but this is still $200,000 above John's price. With three rounds remaining, I'll reject this offer and make one more strong attempt at reaching a deal below John's price. If this doesn't lead to a reasonable counter from Alice, I may need to seriously consider taking John's offer as we're running out of rounds.

The pattern suggests Alice may continue to decrease her price, but too slowly to reach a competitive price point before we run out of rounds. Still, it's worth one more attempt at negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that we're running low on rounds and need to show serious intent to close the deal:

{""product_price"": 1150000}

This counteroffer of $1,150,000:
1. Is very close to John's price of $1,200,000, showing I'm making a final serious attempt
2. Would still save me $50,000 compared to John's offer
3. Demonstrates significant movement from my previous offer of $1,100,000
4. With only 2 rounds remaining after this, this is essentially my ""best and final"" offer

If Alice rejects this offer and doesn't come back with something very close to John's price, I'll likely need to take John's offer in the next round to ensure I secure the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $1,200,000. Here's why:

1. We only have one round left after this one
2. Alice's latest offer of $1,300,000 is still $100,000 above John's price
3. Based on Alice's pattern of small decrements ($100,000 per round), it's unlikely she'll drop below John's price in the final round
4. The risk of losing the deal entirely if we use the last round isn't worth trying to save a small amount
5. We have a guaranteed option to buy at $1,200,000 from John

It's better to secure the deal with John at $1,200,000 rather than risk further negotiation with Alice when she's shown unwillingness to match or beat John's price."
