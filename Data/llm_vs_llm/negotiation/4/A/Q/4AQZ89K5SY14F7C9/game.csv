"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad to see you're willing to increase your bid. Your offer of $1200000 is a step in the right direction, but I still believe the product's value lies higher. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'd like to propose a price that's somewhat of a compromise between your last offer and my previous one. Let's discuss the possibility of $2500000.",2500000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued negotiations, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $1800000. This shows me that you truly value the product, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a potential agreement. However, I still believe the product's worth is higher than your current offer. As a compromise, I'd like to propose a price of $2200000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I hope it's more in line with what you're willing to pay.",2200000.0,Alice,7,
