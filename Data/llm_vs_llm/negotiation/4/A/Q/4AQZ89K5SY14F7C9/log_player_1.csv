Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I believe a more reasonable price for both of us would be $1000000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the minimum value the product is worth to me ($1,000,000), and selling it to John would yield the same amount, I don't see a benefit in accepting Bob's offer over selling to John, or vice versa, in terms of the price. However, negotiating further with Bob might yield a higher price. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer, aiming to find out if Bob is willing to pay more.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still believe the price can be lower. How about we settle on $1200000 instead?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $1,200,000 is higher than his previous offer and also higher than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,000,000) and what John is offering. This indicates that Bob is willing to pay more than the baseline, and there might be room for further negotiation to reach an even higher price. However, the increase from $1,000,000 to $1,200,000 is only $200,000, which might not fully reflect the product's potential value. Given this, I will reject Bob's current offer and make another counteroffer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle of my last offer and his current offer, or slightly higher, to maximize the sale price.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad to see you're willing to increase your bid. Your offer of $1,200,000 is a step in the right direction, but I still believe the product's value lies higher. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'd like to propose a price that's somewhat of a compromise between your last offer and my previous one. Let's discuss the possibility of $2,500,000."", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility, but I still believe we can go lower. Would you consider a price of $1800000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $1,800,000 is an increase from his previous offer of $1,200,000, showing that he is willing to pay more for the product. This price is still below my initial and subsequent offers but is getting closer to what I consider a reasonable sale price. Given that Bob has incrementally increased his offer, it suggests he values the product and is trying to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $1,800,000 is still significantly lower than my last counteroffer of $2,500,000. 

At this point, I need to weigh the potential of continuing negotiations with Bob against the certainty of selling to John for $1,000,000. Since Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is higher than John's offer, and there's a possibility that further negotiation could yield an even higher price, I will reject Bob's current offer and make another counteroffer. This time, I will aim to reduce the gap between my previous offer and Bob's current offer, to encourage a meeting point that is favorable to me.

As a compromise, I'd like to propose a price of $2,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that we can find a more suitable price. How about $1900000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $1,900,000 is another incremental increase, indicating his interest in the product and his attempt to find a mutually acceptable price. This offer is getting closer to what I might consider a reasonable sale price, but it's still below my last counteroffer of $2,200,000. 

Given the progression of Bob's offers, it seems he is willing to pay more but is trying to negotiate the best possible price. His increases are modest, which might suggest he is approaching his maximum willingness to pay. On the other hand, selling to John for $1,000,000 is still an option, but it would mean accepting a significantly lower price than what Bob is currently offering.

At this stage, I will accept Bob's offer of $1,900,000. This decision is based on the fact that Bob's offer is the highest I've received so far, and the negotiation process has been lengthy. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a substantial amount for the product, which is nearly twice what I could get from John. Further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price, and the risk of Bob walking away increases with each counteroffer.
