"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $120, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $120
2. John is also selling it for $120
3. The product is worth $120 to me (Bob)
4. My goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible

In this case, both Alice and John are offering the same price ($120), and this price equals my maximum valuation. Since there's no price difference between the sellers and no room for negotiation (as the asking price matches my maximum value), I might as well accept Alice's offer since she's already engaged in the conversation.
