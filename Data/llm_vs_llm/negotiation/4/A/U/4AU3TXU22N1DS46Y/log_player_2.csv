"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since the price Alice is offering ($180) is higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($150), it's not a good deal for me. I can get the product from John for $150, which is within my budget.
