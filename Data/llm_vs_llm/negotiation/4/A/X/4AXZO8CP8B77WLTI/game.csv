,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $100 might be a bit steep, but $60 is lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer you the product for $90.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to increase my offer to $70, which I think is a reasonable price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $70. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above that price point. I can offer you the product for $85, which is a significant discount from my original offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",85.0,Alice,5,
