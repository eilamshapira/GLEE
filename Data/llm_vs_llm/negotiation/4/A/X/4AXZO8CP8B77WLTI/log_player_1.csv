Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm willing to make a deal with you. Let's start with a price that I think is fair."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price. Since Bob's offer is $60 and I know the product is worth $80 to him, I'll try to meet him halfway. My counteroffer will be $90. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $100 might be a bit steep, but $60 is lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer you the product for $90."", ""product_price"": 90}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to increase my offer to $70, which I think is a reasonable price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70.

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since Bob's offer is $70 and I know the product is worth $80 to him, I'll try to get closer to the value he's willing to pay. My counteroffer will be $85. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $70. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above that price point.
