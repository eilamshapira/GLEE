"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept $8000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I understand your position, but my costs and the product's quality justify a higher price. I can reduce my initial asking price to $16000, which is still a fair value for this product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
