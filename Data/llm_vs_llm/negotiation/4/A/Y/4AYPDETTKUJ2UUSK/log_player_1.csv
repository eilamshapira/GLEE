"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a wonderful product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $17,500. This is a fair price considering the product's features and worth."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even below Bob's own valuation of $10,000. I will continue negotiating with a counteroffer in the next round, as there might still be room to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept $8,000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I understand your position, but my costs and the product's quality justify a higher price. I can reduce my initial asking price to $16,000, which is still a fair value for this product."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, I still think that's too high. Considering I can get it for $10000 elsewhere, I'm willing to go up to $9000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob has revealed that his maximum valuation is $10,000 (by mentioning he can get it elsewhere for that price), and his current offer is still below that, it's clear we won't reach a price above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. John's guaranteed offer of $15,000 is the best option, as it meets my minimum price requirement and ensures a profitable sale."
