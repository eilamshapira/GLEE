,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $8000 is a starting point, I need to be transparent that this product has significant value. I can come down from my initial price, but $10500 would be a more reasonable price given the product's quality and market value. Would this work for you?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks Alice, I appreciate the flexibility. However, $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I can go up to $9000, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
