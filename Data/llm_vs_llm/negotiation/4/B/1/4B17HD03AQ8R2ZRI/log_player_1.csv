"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $12,000, which represents excellent value given its quality and features. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product sounds interesting, but my budget is a bit tighter. I'm willing to offer $8000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Since Bob is willing to pay $8,000 (which matches John's offer), there's potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob, as his first counter suggests he might have room in his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $8,000 is a starting point, I need to be transparent that this product has significant value. I can come down from my initial price, but $10,500 would be a more reasonable price given the product's quality and market value. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, I appreciate the flexibility. However, $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I can go up to $9000, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $9,000. This is a good outcome because:
1. It's $1,000 more than John's guaranteed offer of $8,000
2. Bob stated this is his final offer, so pushing further might risk losing the deal
3. It's a reasonable compromise from both our initial positions"
