"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer since $150 is higher than my maximum value of $100 and higher than John's price. It's better to either negotiate for a lower price or ultimately buy from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer significantly below Alice's initial offer but still reasonable enough to potentially start a productive negotiation.

{""product_price"": 75}

This price point is:
1. Below my maximum value ($100)
2. Gives room for negotiation
3. Still provides a better option than John's $100 offer
4. Shows I'm serious about getting a good deal"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer as $140 is still above both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). Alice only reduced the price by $10, which suggests we're still far from reaching a mutually acceptable price. I'll continue negotiating since we still have several rounds left and there's room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 85}

I'll increase my previous offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a good margin below my maximum value. This offer:
1. Shows movement from my previous offer of $75
2. Keeps the price well below my maximum value of $100
3. Maintains room for further negotiation
4. Is significantly lower than Alice's last offer of $140, signaling that we need to meet somewhere in the middle
5. Still gives me the option to go to John at $100 if negotiations fail"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John now because:
1. Alice's offers are still significantly above John's price of $100
2. Alice's price reductions are very small (from $150 to $140 to $135)
3. The pattern suggests Alice is unlikely to drop the price below $100 in the remaining rounds
4. John's price of $100 matches my maximum value
5. Further negotiation rounds might not lead to a better outcome

It's better to secure the purchase at $100 from John than continue negotiations that seem unlikely to result in a better price."
