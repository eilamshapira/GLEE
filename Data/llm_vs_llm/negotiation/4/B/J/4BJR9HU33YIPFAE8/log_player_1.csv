Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this offer:

1. My minimum acceptable price is $120 (I can get this from John)
2. I don't know Bob's maximum willingness to pay
3. If I price too high, Bob might reject, and I'll only get $120 from John
4. If I price too low, I might leave money on the table
5. I should set a price significantly above $120 to maximize my potential profit
