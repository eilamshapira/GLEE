"Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to consider my options carefully here.

Alice is offering the product for $25,000, which is significantly above my maximum value of $8,000. In fact, it's more than three times what the product is worth to me.

John is offering to sell me the same product for exactly $8,000, which matches my maximum value.

There's no reason to accept Alice's current offer since it's much higher than my alternative option. I could reject and make a counteroffer, but since John's offer is already at my maximum value threshold, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice unless I believe she would accept a price significantly lower than $8,000.

Given these circumstances, the rational choice is to:
