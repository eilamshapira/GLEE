"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product sounds interesting, but $20000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $5000 for it.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $20000 might be a bit steep, but $5000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'll lower my price, but I still need to get a fair value for the product.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. However, $17500 is still too high for my budget. How about $7500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $7500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $12000 for the product. I'm open to continuing our negotiation, but I want to emphasize that this is a unique opportunity to acquire this product.",12000.0,Alice,5,
