"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product sounds interesting, but $20000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $5000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $5000 is too low for me. I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob or eventually sell it to him for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $20,000 might be a bit steep, but $5,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'll lower my price, but I still need to get a fair value for the product."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. However, $17500 is still too high for my budget. How about $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Although Bob has increased his offer, $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that with further negotiation, Bob will be willing to pay a higher price for the product. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $7,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $12,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $7,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $12,000 for the product. I'm open to continuing our negotiation, but I want to emphasize that this is a unique opportunity to acquire this product."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
