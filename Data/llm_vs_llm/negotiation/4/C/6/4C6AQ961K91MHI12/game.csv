"Hi Bob, I have a product I'm looking to sell. It's high quality and I'm offering it to you for $125. This is a fair price considering the value it provides. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?",125.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $125 is quite high for this product. I've done my research on market prices, and I believe $85 would be a more reasonable price. This would still give you a fair profit while being more aligned with market value. Would you consider this offer?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concern about the price, but $85 is too close to my bottom line. The product has exceptional quality and durability that justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer - how about $105? This represents a substantial discount from my original price while still reflecting the true value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
