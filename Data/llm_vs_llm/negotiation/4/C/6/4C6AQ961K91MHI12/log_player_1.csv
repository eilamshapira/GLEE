"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I'm looking to sell. It's high quality and I'm offering it to you for $125. This is a fair price considering the value it provides. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $125 is quite high for this product. I've done my research on market prices, and I believe $85 would be a more reasonable price. This would still give you a fair profit while being more aligned with market value. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concern about the price, but $85 is too close to my bottom line. The product has exceptional quality and durability that justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer - how about $105? This represents a substantial discount from my original price while still reflecting the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}"
