"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I'm looking to sell. It's high quality and I'm offering it to you for $125. This is a fair price considering the value it provides. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer of $125 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80), it wouldn't be rational to accept this offer. John's price is already at my maximum willingness to pay, so I should try to negotiate with Alice first to see if I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still reasonable given that the product is worth $80 to her.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $125 is quite high for this product. I've done my research on market prices, and I believe $85 would be a more reasonable price. This would still give you a fair profit while being more aligned with market value. Would you consider this offer?"", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concern about the price, but $85 is too close to my bottom line. The product has exceptional quality and durability that justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer - how about $105? This represents a substantial discount from my original price while still reflecting the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $105 is still well above my maximum value of $80 and John's price of $80. While Alice did come down from her initial price, there's no reason for me to pay $105 when I can get the same product from John for $80. Since we've already had two rounds of negotiation and Alice is still quite far from a price I would accept, it's becoming less likely we'll reach a mutually beneficial deal.
