Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 120}

I'll offer the product at $120 because:
1. The product is worth $120 to Bob
2. If Bob rejects, I can still sell it to John for $120
3. Since $120 is Bob's maximum value, offering any higher would guarantee rejection
4. Offering lower would reduce my profit unnecessarily"
