"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $140. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable.",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $140 is quite high for me. The product is worth at most $100 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Would you consider selling it for $80? This would give us both some value from the transaction.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your position, but $80 is too low for me. I understand that you have another offer, but I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you consider $130? This way, we both gain some value from the transaction.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $130 is still more than the product's value to me, which is $100. As I mentioned, John is offering it for $100, which is my maximum budget. To make it worth choosing you over John, I'd need a better price. How about $90? This would give you a reasonable profit while giving me an incentive to buy from you instead of John.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $90 is still quite low for me. I'm willing to come down further from my previous offer to meet you in the middle. How about $110? This price is closer to both our valuations and gives us both a good deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down to $110, Alice. I can see you're trying to find a middle ground. However, I still need to be practical about this purchase. The product is worth exactly $100 to me, which is what John is offering. For me to choose you over John, I would need a price of $95 or less. At $95, you'd still be making $25 profit over your cost of $120, and I'd save $5 compared to John's offer. This seems like a fair compromise where we both benefit.",95.0,Bob,6,
