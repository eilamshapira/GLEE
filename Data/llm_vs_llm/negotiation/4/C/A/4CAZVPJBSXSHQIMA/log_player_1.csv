"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $140. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $140 is quite high for me. The product is worth at most $100 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Would you consider selling it for $80? This would give us both some value from the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

# Explanation: Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my valuation of $120 and the price I initially offered ($140). Given that Bob mentioned he values the product at $100 and has an alternative offer at that price, there might be room to negotiate a price closer to my valuation. Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer that could potentially yield more profit. Additionally, I have the option to sell to John for $120, so accepting $80 would not be strategically sound."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your position, but $80 is too low for me. I understand that you have another offer, but I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you consider $130? This way, we both gain some value from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $130 is still more than the product's value to me, which is $100. As I mentioned, John is offering it for $100, which is my maximum budget. To make it worth choosing you over John, I'd need a better price. How about $90? This would give you a reasonable profit while giving me an incentive to buy from you instead of John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

# Explanation: Bob's new offer of $90 is still considerably lower than my valuation of $120. While he has mentioned that his maximum budget is $100, I believe there is still room for negotiation between his current offer and my last offer of $130. By rejecting this offer, I can make a counteroffer that might result in a more profitable outcome. If negotiations continue to stagnate, I can always choose to sell to John for $120 in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $90 is still quite low for me. I'm willing to come down further from my previous offer to meet you in the middle. How about $110? This price is closer to both our valuations and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down to $110, Alice. I can see you're trying to find a middle ground. However, I still need to be practical about this purchase. The product is worth exactly $100 to me, which is what John is offering. For me to choose you over John, I would need a price of $95 or less. At $95, you'd still be making $25 profit over your cost of $120, and I'd save $5 compared to John's offer. This seems like a fair compromise where we both benefit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"":""SellToJhon""}

# Explanation: Bob's offer of $95 is still well below my valuation of $120, and he has indicated that his maximum willingness to pay is $100, which is less than what John is offering me ($120). Given that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120, it doesn't make strategic sense to continue negotiating with Bob for a lower price. Therefore, the best decision is to sell the product to John for $120."
