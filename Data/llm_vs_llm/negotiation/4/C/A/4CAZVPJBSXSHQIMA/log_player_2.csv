"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $140. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to consider my options carefully here. Alice is offering the product for $140, which is above the $100 maximum value to me. Meanwhile, John is offering the same product for $100, which is exactly my maximum willingness to pay.

Since Alice's initial offer exceeds what the product is worth to me, and John's offer is exactly at my maximum acceptable price, the rational choice is to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $140 is quite high for me. The product is worth at most $100 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Would you consider selling it for $80? This would give us both some value from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your position, but $80 is too low for me. I understand that you have another offer, but I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you consider $130? This way, we both gain some value from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has come down from $140 to $130, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but this is still above the $100 maximum value to me. Given that John is offering the product for $100 (which is exactly what the product is worth to me), Alice would need to offer a better price for me to accept her offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $130 is still more than the product's value to me, which is $100. As I mentioned, John is offering it for $100, which is my maximum budget. To make it worth choosing you over John, I'd need a better price. How about $90? This would give you a reasonable profit while giving me an incentive to buy from you instead of John."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $90 is still quite low for me. I'm willing to come down further from my previous offer to meet you in the middle. How about $110? This price is closer to both our valuations and gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has now offered $110, which is closer but still above my maximum value of $100. Since John is offering the product at exactly $100, Alice's current offer doesn't provide me with any additional value. In fact, I would be paying $10 more than the product is worth to me.

At this point, I should either try one more counteroffer or simply buy from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down to $110, Alice. I can see you're trying to find a middle ground. However, I still need to be practical about this purchase. The product is worth exactly $100 to me, which is what John is offering. For me to choose you over John, I would need a price of $95 or less. At $95, you'd still be making $25 profit over your cost of $120, and I'd save $5 compared to John's offer. This seems like a fair compromise where we both benefit."", ""product_price"": 95}"
