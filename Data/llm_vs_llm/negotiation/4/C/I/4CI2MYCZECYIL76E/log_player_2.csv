"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $19,000 is significantly higher than John's fixed price of $10,000, and even higher than my maximum value of $10,000. There's no reason to accept this offer. While I could immediately go to John, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first to potentially get an even better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice started very high at $19,000, I'll start low but not insultingly low. Given that my maximum value is $10,000 and that's also John's price, I'll offer significantly below that to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 6000}

This counteroffer of $6,000:
1. Shows I'm serious about buying but find her initial price unreasonable
2. Leaves room for negotiation upward
3. If accepted, would save me $4,000 compared to John's price
4. Even if rejected, helps establish a more reasonable price range for future negotiations"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $19,000 to $14,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000). There's no reason to accept this offer when I can either:
1. Continue negotiating with Alice to get a better price
2. Go to John for $10,000 if negotiations don't work out

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to meet somewhere below $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has moved down from $19,000 to $14,000, I'll increase my previous offer to show good faith in the negotiation, but still stay well below my maximum value.

{""product_price"": 7500}

This counteroffer of $7,500:
1. Shows meaningful movement from my previous offer of $6,000
2. Maintains a strong negotiating position below my maximum value
3. Signals I'm willing to meet in the middle
4. Still leaves room for further negotiation while potentially saving $2,500+ compared to John's price
5. Demonstrates I'm a serious buyer but won't overpay"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $10,000 because:

1. Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above John's price of $10,000
2. While Alice has been moving down in price ($19,000 → $14,000 → $11,500), she's still not matching or beating John's price
3. Even though we could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will go below $10,000
4. Since the product is only worth $10,000 to me, there's no reason to pay more than that
5. We've already spent several rounds negotiating, and time has value too

It's most rational to take John's guaranteed $10,000 offer rather than continue negotiations or accept a higher price from Alice."
