"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm thinking a price of $25000 feels fair. What are your thoughts?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking this product is worth closer to $5000. Would you be willing to come down to $5500?",5500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $5500 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will provide a great return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $18000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, there's still a large gap between our valuations. To be frank, anything above $8000 isn't going to work for me. If you're able to come down to $7000, I'm ready to close the deal today.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your candor and desire to reach a deal. However, $7000 undervalues the true worth of this product and the benefits it offers.  I'm willing to come down to $12000 as a final offer. This reflects my effort to find a middle ground while ensuring a fair price for such a valuable item.  Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I've found a similar product elsewhere for $8000.  I'm willing to make one final offer of $7500 to work with you. If you can't accept that, I'll need to go with the other option.",7500.0,Bob,6,
