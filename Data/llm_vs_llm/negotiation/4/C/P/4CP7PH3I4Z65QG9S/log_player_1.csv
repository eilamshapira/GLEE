Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I've found a similar product elsewhere for $8000.  I'm willing to make one final offer of $7500 to work with you. If you can't accept that, I'll need to go with the other option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

While Bob's latest offer is closer to a reasonable compromise, it's clear he's unwilling to meet at a price point that reflects the product's value.  Selling to John for $15,000 ensures a guaranteed return and avoids further time spent in potentially fruitless negotiations."
