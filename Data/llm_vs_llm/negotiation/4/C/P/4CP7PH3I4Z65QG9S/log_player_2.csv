"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm thinking a price of $25000 feels fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting price is far too high.  It's important to signal that you won't accept an unreasonable price, and making a strong counteroffer is the way to do that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking this product is worth closer to $5,000. Would you be willing to come down to $5,500?"",
""product_price"": 5500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:** Starting at $5,500 establishes a much lower anchor point and signals that I'm serious about a significantly lower price.
* **Slight Padding:** While $5,000 is my ideal target, offering $5,500 leaves me some room to negotiate upward if Alice completely rejects this initial counter. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite to maintain a good negotiating relationship but firm in stating that the initial offer is unacceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $5500 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will provide a great return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $18000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $18,000 is still much higher than my target. I need to show I'm willing to walk away if the price doesn't become reasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, there's still a large gap between our valuations. To be frank, anything above $8,000 isn't going to work for me. If you're able to come down to $7,000, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Walk-Away Point:** I'm making it clear that $8,000 (John's price) is my upper limit. This puts pressure on Alice to realize I have a viable alternative.
* **Significant Jump but Still Room:** Offering $7,000 is a significant jump from $5,500, but it allows for further negotiation without immediately hitting my walk-away point.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By saying ""ready to close the deal today,"" I add a bit of pressure and incentivize Alice to settle quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your candor and desire to reach a deal. However, $7000 undervalues the true worth of this product and the benefits it offers.  I'm willing to come down to $12000 as a final offer. This reflects my effort to find a middle ground while ensuring a fair price for such a valuable item.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is getting closer, $12,000 is still too far from my $8,000 walk-away point.  It's time to reinforce my limit and signal that I'm prepared to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I've found a similar product elsewhere for $8,000.  I'm willing to make one final offer of $7,500 to work with you. If you can't accept that, I'll need to go with the other option."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By explicitly stating this is my final offer, I'm communicating the seriousness of my position.
* **Mentioning Alternative:** I'm not bluffing about John's offer, and letting Alice know keeps the pressure on her to make a decision.
* **Slight Increase:** Offering $7,500 is a small concession to show flexibility, but I'm holding firm near my $8,000 limit.

This is a strong but fair offer. It either gets Alice to agree to a price closer to my valuation or it allows me to walk away knowing I tried my best."
