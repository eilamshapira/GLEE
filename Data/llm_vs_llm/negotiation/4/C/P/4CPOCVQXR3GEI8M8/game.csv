"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $10000 is below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $16500? This price reflects a significant discount while still maintaining the value of the product.",16500.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16000 is still too high for me. I can raise my offer to $11000, which is more reflective of the current market value. I want to make this deal work, but I need a more competitive price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. However, $11000 is still below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to lower my price further to $15500, which is very close to our bottom line and reflects a significant concession on our part.",15500.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
