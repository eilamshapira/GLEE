"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $18000. This is a great opportunity to get a top-quality item at a competitive rate. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth only $12,000 to me
2. Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly above my maximum value
3. I can buy the same product from John for $12,000

I will reject Alice's offer as $18,000 is far too high and well above my maximum value of $12,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but still gives room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18,000 is significantly above market value for this product. Given current market conditions, I would be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair offer considering similar products available in the market."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. Let's find a middle ground. I can offer you the product for $16000. This is a fair price considering the quality and value of what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $16,000 is still above both:
1. My maximum value ($12,000)
2. John's guaranteed offer ($12,000)

Since Alice's price is still too high and I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $12,000, which is my maximum value, there's no reason to accept this offer. I'll reject it and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly but remain well below my maximum value, leaving room for further negotiation while still being reasonable given that Alice's cost is $15,000.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I can raise my offer to $11,000, which is more reflective of the current market value. I want to make this deal work, but I need a more competitive price."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I need to maintain the value of the product. I can go down to $15250. This is my final offer before considering other buyers. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's offer of $15,250 is still above:
1. My maximum value ($12,000)
2. John's guaranteed offer ($12,000)

Since Alice indicates this is her ""final offer"" and it's still well above both my maximum value and John's price, it makes the most sense to buy from John rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to reach an acceptable price point.
