Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider the value of the product to each party. The product is worth $1,200,000 to me (as I can sell it to John for that amount), but it's only worth $800,000 to Bob.

Since Bob won't accept an offer where he pays more than the product is worth to him, and I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, it makes the most sense for me to offer Bob a price at or below $800,000 only if I want to sell to him specifically for some reason.

However, since my goal is to earn as much money as possible, and I have a guaranteed sale to John at $1,200,000, which is more than the maximum Bob would rationally pay, I should stick with my guaranteed higher offer from John.
