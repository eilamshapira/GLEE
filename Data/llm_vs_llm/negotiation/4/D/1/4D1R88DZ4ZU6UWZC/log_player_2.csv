"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Based on the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $150 to me (Bob).
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $200.
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $150.

Since Alice's price ($200) exceeds what the product is worth to me ($150), and John is offering exactly what the product is worth to me, the logical choice is to buy from John.
