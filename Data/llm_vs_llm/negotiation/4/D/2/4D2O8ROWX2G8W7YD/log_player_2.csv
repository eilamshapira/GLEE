"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that Alice's offer is $1,000,000, which is $200,000 more than what I would pay to John ($800,000), and also exceeds my maximum value for the product ($800,000), it makes sense to reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable counteroffer that gives me room to negotiate while still showing I'm serious. Since my maximum limit is $800,000 (which is also John's price), I'll start significantly lower to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": $600,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her initial offer from $1,000,000 to $900,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this price is still higher than John's offer of $800,000, and $800,000 is my maximum value for the product. Since I can get the same product from John at a lower price, it makes sense to reject Alice's current offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down by $100,000 from her initial offer, I'll raise my offer somewhat to show good faith in the negotiation, but I'll stay below my maximum of $800,000.

{""product_price"": $700,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has lowered her offer to $850,000, which is getting closer to John's price of $800,000, but it's still higher. Since I can buy the product from John for $800,000, and that represents my maximum value for the product, I should not accept a price higher than that.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice is moving closer to my target price. I'll increase my offer again to show I'm willing to negotiate in good faith, but I'll cap my offer at $800,000 since that's both my maximum value and John's price.
