"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to consider this situation carefully. Alice is offering to sell the product for $14,000, but the product is only worth up to $8,000 to me. 

If I accept Alice's offer, I'll be paying $6,000 more than the product's value to me, which is not a good decision.

I could make a counteroffer to Alice, but since she values the product at $10,000, she's unlikely to sell below that price.

Meanwhile, John is offering the product for exactly $8,000, which matches the maximum value I place on the product.

The rational choice is to buy from John rather than overpay with Alice or engage in a negotiation where Alice is unlikely to go below her valuation.
