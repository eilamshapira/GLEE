"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $15000. This is a competitive price for what you're getting. Would you like to proceed with the purchase?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $15000 is quite a bit more than I was hoping to spend. While I'm interested, my budget is much closer to $6000. Would you be willing to consider a price in that range?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $6000 is too low for this product. Given its value and quality, I could offer it to you for $13500, which is already a reduction from my initial price. Would this work for you?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. $13500 is still outside my target range. The most I'm willing to spend is $7000. I understand if that's not feasible for you, but I want to be upfront about my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
