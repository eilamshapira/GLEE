Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $15,000. This is a competitive price for what you're getting. Would you like to proceed with the purchase?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $15000 is quite a bit more than I was hoping to spend. While I'm interested, my budget is much closer to $6000. Would you be willing to consider a price in that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. While I appreciate his interest, $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, I need to stay well above that threshold to make the negotiation worthwhile.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $6,000 is too low for this product. Given its value and quality, I could offer it to you for $13,500, which is already a reduction from my initial price. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. $13500 is still outside my target range. The most I'm willing to spend is $7000. I understand if that's not feasible for you, but I want to be upfront about my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

Given that Bob's highest offer of $7,000 is still significantly below my guaranteed price of $10,000 from John, and considering that Bob has indicated this is the most he's willing to spend, it makes the most financial sense to sell to John. There's no point continuing negotiations when the gap is this large and Bob has stated his maximum budget."
