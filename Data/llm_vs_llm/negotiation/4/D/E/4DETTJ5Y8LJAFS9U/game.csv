"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I need to be honest that $150 is beyond what I can justify for its value. I have another seller offering the same product for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a middle ground. Would you consider $80 for the product? This would give me a reason to choose you over the other option.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your honest feedback and for considering my product. I understand that $150 might be out of your budget, but I also have to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Since you mentioned another seller is offering it for $100, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and that price. I'd be willing to sell it to you for $125. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my initial offer.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still can't justify paying $125 when I have a confirmed option to purchase the identical product for $100 from another seller. I'm interested in working with you, but I can only offer $90 for the product. This gives you a competitive advantage over my alternative option while staying within my budget. This is truly the most I can spend while making a rational purchasing decision.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and honesty about your budget. I'm glad you're interested in working with me, and I'm willing to make one more adjustment to try to meet your needs. Considering you have an alternative option at $100, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to another buyer who has already offered me $100.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price to $110. That's definitely getting closer, but I still can't justify paying more than what the alternative seller is offering, especially when that price already matches my maximum budget for this item. I understand you mentioned another buyer at $100, which is exactly what John is offering me. To make it worth choosing you over my alternative, I can offer $95 - this gives you a better deal than your other potential buyer while staying within my budget constraints. This is truly my final offer as we're now very close to my maximum.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer of $95, and I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. However, as I've mentioned before, I have another buyer willing to pay $100 for the product. Given that we're so close, I'm willing to make a small concession to try to close the deal with you. I'll meet you halfway between your offer and the $100 that I can get from the other buyer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $97.50. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and the alternative offer I have. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to sell to the other buyer.",97.5,Alice,7,
