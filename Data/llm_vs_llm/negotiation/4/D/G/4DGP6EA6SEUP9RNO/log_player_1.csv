Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Given Bob's offer of $10,000 (my minimum acceptable price), I have a decision to make. I can either take the $10,000 from Bob, or sell to John for the same price.

Since I don't know what Bob values the product at, and I can get my minimum acceptable price from Bob, I will accept his offer.
