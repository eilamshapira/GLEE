"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While I'm willing to pay up to $15,000, there's no harm in seeing if Alice will accept a lower price.  I have a backup option with John, so I'm not risking anything by trying to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:** This is a significant price drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves me room to negotiate upward if needed. It also lets Alice know I'm serious about getting a better deal."
