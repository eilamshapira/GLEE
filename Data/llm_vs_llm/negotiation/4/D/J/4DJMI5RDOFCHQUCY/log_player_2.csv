"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value, I'm starting the bidding at $2000000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. While I could make a counteroffer, there's a large gap between Alice's price and my maximum value, and I already have a guaranteed option at my maximum price point. In this case, the safest and most rational decision would be to buy from John.
