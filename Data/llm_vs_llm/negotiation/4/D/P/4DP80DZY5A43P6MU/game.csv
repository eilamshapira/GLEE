"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I can actually get this same product from another seller, John, for $120. Since that's the maximum I'm willing to pay, I'd like to offer you $100 for it. This gives you a quick sale and saves me some shopping around. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you have another option, but I believe the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $130. What do you say?",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice. However, I still can't justify paying $130 when John is selling the identical product for $120. That's actually the maximum value this product has for me. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $110, which saves me a bit compared to John's price and still gives you a sale. Can we make that work?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about John's offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and it's still below my initial offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
