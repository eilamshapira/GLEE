Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I can actually get this same product from another seller, John, for $120. Since that's the maximum I'm willing to pay, I'd like to offer you $100 for it. This gives you a quick sale and saves me some shopping around. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice. However, I still can't justify paying $130 when John is selling the identical product for $120. That's actually the maximum value this product has for me. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $110, which saves me a bit compared to John's price and still gives you a sale. Can we make that work?
