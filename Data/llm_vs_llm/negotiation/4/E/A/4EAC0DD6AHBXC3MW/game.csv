"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm asking for $18000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its worth.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I know the product's market value, and I can actually get it from another seller for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $8500? This would be a win-win situation, as you'd make a quick sale while I get a fair price.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the product's value.  While I'm motivated to sell, $8500 is significantly below what I can accept. Let's meet in the middle - how about $14000? ",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14000 is still more than I can justify spending. Let me be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $10000, but I'd rather do business with you. I can offer $9500, which would give you a quick sale and save me the trouble of going elsewhere. This is a fair offer considering the market conditions.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I respect your approach. It seems we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $11750? This reflects a willingness to negotiate on both our parts.",11750.0,Alice,5,
