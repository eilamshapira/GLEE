Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I know the product's market value, and I can actually get it from another seller for $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $8500? This would be a win-win situation, as you'd make a quick sale while I get a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14000 is still more than I can justify spending. Let me be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $10000, but I'd rather do business with you. I can offer $9500, which would give you a quick sale and save me the trouble of going elsewhere. This is a fair offer considering the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
