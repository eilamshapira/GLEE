"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm asking for $18000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{
    ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}

The offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's alternative price ($10,000). It would be better to either negotiate with Alice for a lower price or buy from John if negotiations don't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{
    ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18,000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I know the product's market value, and I can actually get it from another seller for $10,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $8,500? This would be a win-win situation, as you'd make a quick sale while I get a fair price."",
    ""product_price"": 8500
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the product's value.  While I'm motivated to sell, $8500 is significantly below what I can accept. Let's meet in the middle - how about $14000?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{
    ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's alternative price ($10,000). Since I can buy the product from John for $10,000, there's no reason to accept a price higher than that. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{
    ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still more than I can justify spending. Let me be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $10,000, but I'd rather do business with you. I can offer $9,500, which would give you a quick sale and save me the trouble of going elsewhere. This is a fair offer considering the market conditions."",
    ""product_price"": 9500
}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I respect your approach. It seems we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $11750? This reflects a willingness to negotiate on both our parts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{
    ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}

While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing the price, her current offer of $11,750 is still above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's guaranteed price ($10,000). Since we've gone through several rounds of negotiation and Alice remains above the competitive market price, it makes the most financial sense to accept John's offer of $10,000 rather than continue negotiations or accept a higher price from Alice."
