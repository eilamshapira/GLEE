"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: Would cost $200
2. Reject Alice's offer and buy from John: Would cost $120
3. Since I value the product at no more than $120, paying $200 would be a bad decision.

John's offer at $120 is exactly at my maximum valuation and is $80 cheaper than Alice's offer. This is clearly the best option.
