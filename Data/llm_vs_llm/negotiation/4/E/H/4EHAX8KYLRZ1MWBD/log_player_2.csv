"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's alternative offer ($12,000), I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. There's no reason to accept a price that's much higher than my alternative option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 8000}

I'll offer $8,000, which is significantly lower than John's price of $12,000. This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to get a better deal than John's offer. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate upward while staying below my maximum value of $12,000."
