"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a product that I value at $12000. However, I understand that every buyer has different needs and valuations. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000, which represents the minimum value I can accept for this product. If this doesn't work for you, I already have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase it at this price. Let me know if you're interested.",12000.0,Alice,1,
