"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a product that I value at $12000. However, I understand that every buyer has different needs and valuations. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000, which represents the minimum value I can accept for this product. If this doesn't work for you, I already have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase it at this price. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
