"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $2400000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $1000000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I can offer $800000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still providing you with a sale. Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
