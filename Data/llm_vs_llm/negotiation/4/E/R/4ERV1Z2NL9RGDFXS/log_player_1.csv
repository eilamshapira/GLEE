Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Dear Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our exclusive product at a price of $2,400,000. I believe this unique opportunity delivers exceptional value, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $2400000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $1000000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I can offer $800000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still providing you with a sale. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
