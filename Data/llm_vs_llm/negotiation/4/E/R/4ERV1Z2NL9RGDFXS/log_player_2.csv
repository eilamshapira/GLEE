"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our exclusive product at a price of $2400000. I believe this unique opportunity delivers exceptional value, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","This offer is well above the maximum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me. It's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $1,000,000. Since Alice is asking for more than twice what John would charge, and more than twice what the product is worth to me, it makes sense to reject this offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $2,400,000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $1,000,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I can offer $800,000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still providing you with a sale. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
