# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Considering its value and exclusivity, I'm offering it to you for $11500.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $11,500 is close to my maximum budget of $12,000, but still above the value Alice has for the product ($10,000), I believe there's room for negotiation to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's initial offer and my goal to save as much money as possible, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still reasonable, to leave room for further negotiation.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $9000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell the product for $11000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $11,000 is still close to my maximum budget of $12,000, and it's only $1,000 less than what I can get from John. Considering that Alice's value for the product is $10,000, I believe there's still some room for negotiation to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer of $11,000 is still a bit high for me, and she's willing to negotiate, I'll try to meet her halfway between her previous offer and my previous counteroffer. However, I'll also consider that she might be willing to go lower since her value for the product is $10,000.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still very interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we try $10,250? I think this is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10250}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Given the value of the product, and considering your interest, I am prepared to lower my price to $10750. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's final offer of $10,750 is closer to my target price, and it's lower than what I can get from John ($12,000). Considering that Alice's value for the product is $10,000, I believe $10,750 is a reasonable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by trying to negotiate further.
