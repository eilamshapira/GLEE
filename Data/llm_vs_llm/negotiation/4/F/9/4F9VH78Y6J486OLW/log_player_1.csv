I will sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000. Bob's final offer of $1,000,000 is close, but it's still lower than the offer I have from Jhon. Since Bob has stated that $1,000,000 is his highest offer, I don't see any potential for further negotiation that would meet my minimum value. Selling to Jhon guarantees me a higher price, which aligns with my goal of earning as much money as possible for the product."
