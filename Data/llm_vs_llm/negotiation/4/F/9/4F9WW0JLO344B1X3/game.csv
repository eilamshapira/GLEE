"Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it at $2000000, which represents an excellent investment opportunity given its quality and potential. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on this offer.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I find the price to be quite high. I am looking to spend no more than $1500000, and I have another offer at this price. Given this, I am willing to purchase the product from you at $1200000. This would allow us to move forward quickly and efficiently.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1200000 is my absolute minimum value for this product. Given that you mentioned you have another offer at $1500000, I believe that represents a more realistic market value. I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial ask to $1700000, which I think is fair considering the product's quality and potential return on investment. I'm open to further discussion, but I need to move closer to a price that reflects the true value of what I'm offering.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1700000 is still too high for me. I understand the value of the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to raise my offer to $1350000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price given my budget constraints.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you raising your offer to $1350000. I can see that you're genuinely interested in the product, and I'm committed to finding a middle ground that works for both of us. Given your budget constraints and my minimum acceptable value, I'm willing to lower my price to $1550000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial ask and moves us closer to your range. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer to an agreement. I appreciate your flexibility in lowering your price to $1550000. However, I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to raise my offer to $1425000. This is a fair middle ground between your last offer and my budget. I believe this price acknowledges the value of the product while respecting my financial constraints.",1425000.0,Bob,6,
