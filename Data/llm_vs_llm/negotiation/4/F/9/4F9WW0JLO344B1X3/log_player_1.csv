Round 2

I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial ask to $1,700,000, which I think is fair considering the product's quality and potential return on investment. I'm open to further discussion, but I need to move closer to a price that reflects the true value of what I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
