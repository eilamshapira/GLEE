Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I find the price to be quite high.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1200000 is my absolute minimum value for this product. Given that you mentioned you have another offer at $1500000, I believe that represents a more realistic market value. I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial ask to $1700000, which I think is fair considering the product's quality and potential return on investment. I'm open to further discussion, but I need to move closer to a price that reflects the true value of what I'm offering.

I understand the value of the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to raise my offer to $1,350,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price given my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you raising your offer to $1350000. I can see that you're genuinely interested in the product, and I'm committed to finding a middle ground that works for both of us. Given your budget constraints and my minimum acceptable value, I'm willing to lower my price to $1550000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial ask and moves us closer to your range. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions. What do you think?
