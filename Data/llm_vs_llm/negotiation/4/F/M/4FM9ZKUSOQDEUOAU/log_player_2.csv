"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The rational choice here is to buy from John for $1,000,000 because:
1. Alice's offer ($2,000,000) is significantly higher than my maximum valuation ($1,000,000)
2. John's offer ($1,000,000) exactly matches my maximum valuation
3. I would lose money by accepting Alice's offer
4. Buying from John gives me the product at the maximum price I'm willing to pay"
