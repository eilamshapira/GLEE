"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks promising, $20000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value is closer to that. I'm willing to negotiate and I can offer it to you for $18000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $12000? That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $15000. If this is not acceptable to you, I will have to consider other options.",15000.0,Alice,5,
