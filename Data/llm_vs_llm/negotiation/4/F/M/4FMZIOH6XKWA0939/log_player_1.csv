"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks promising, $20000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. My counteroffer will be $18,000. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value is closer to that. I'm willing to negotiate and I can offer it to you for $18,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.""}"

Bob's offer:

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $12,000 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping for, but I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. My counteroffer will be $15,000.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than $12,000.
