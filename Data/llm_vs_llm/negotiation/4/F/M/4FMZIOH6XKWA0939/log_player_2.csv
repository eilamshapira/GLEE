You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value is closer to that. I'm willing to negotiate and I can offer it to you for $18000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $15000. If this is not acceptable to you, I will have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's clear Alice isn't budging much further. Taking the guaranteed $12,000 deal from John makes more sense than potentially overpaying with Alice."
