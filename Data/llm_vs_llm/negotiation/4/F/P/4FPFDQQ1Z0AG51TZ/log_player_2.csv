"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm selling this amazing product. It's in great condition. How about $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I should reject this offer because $150 is higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120). Since I can always buy from John at $120, there's no reason to accept a higher price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I can buy the product from John for $120, I'll offer Alice a lower price to try to get a better deal.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit high for me. Since I can find similar products for less elsewhere, would you consider selling it for $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the quick response, Bob! I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, I value the product a bit higher than that. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's offer of $140 is still higher than John's price of $120. Since I can get the same product from John for $120, there's no reason to accept a higher price from Alice. While I could continue negotiating, since Alice's price is still significantly above John's price, it's more efficient to just buy from John now.
