"Hi Alice, while I appreciate the value you see in the product, the price of $2500000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1200000. Is this something we can work with?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be clear that $1200000 is below my minimum threshold for this product. I have another buyer willing to pay $1500000, which represents the absolute minimum I can accept. However, given your interest, I'm willing to come down from my initial ask to $1950000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value. Can we find some middle ground here?",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $1950000 is still out of my budget. Given that you mentioned another buyer at $1500000, I'm willing to match that offer. Can we agree on $1500000? This would be a fair price for both of us and within my financial limits.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
