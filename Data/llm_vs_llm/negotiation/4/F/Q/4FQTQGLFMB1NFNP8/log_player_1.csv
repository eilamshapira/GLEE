Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while I appreciate the value you see in the product, the price of $2500000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1200000. Is this something we can work with?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be clear that $1,200,000 is below my minimum threshold for this product. I have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000, which represents the absolute minimum I can accept. However, given your interest, I'm willing to come down from my initial ask to $1,950,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $1950000 is still out of my budget. Given that you mentioned another buyer at $1500000, I'm willing to match that offer. Can we agree on $1500000? This would be a fair price for both of us and within my financial limits.
