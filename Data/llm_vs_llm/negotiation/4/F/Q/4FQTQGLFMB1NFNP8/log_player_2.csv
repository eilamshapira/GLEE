Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, while I appreciate the value you see in the product, the price of $2,500,000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. Is this something we can work with?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be clear that $1200000 is below my minimum threshold for this product. I have another buyer willing to pay $1500000, which represents the absolute minimum I can accept. However, given your interest, I'm willing to come down from my initial ask to $1950000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value. Can we find some middle ground here? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,950,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $1,950,000 is still out of my budget. Given that you mentioned another buyer at $1,500,000, I'm willing to match that offer. Can we agree on $1,500,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and within my financial limits."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
