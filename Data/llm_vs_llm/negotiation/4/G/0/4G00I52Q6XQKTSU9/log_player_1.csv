Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,200,000. This is a competitive price for a product of this caliber."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, your asking price of $1200000 is significantly above my budget. I need to be transparent that the product is worth no more than $800000 to me, which is also the price another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $650000 for the product? This would make it worthwhile for me to choose your offer over the alternative. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $650,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and since I know I can get $800,000 from John, there's no reason to accept such a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and transparency. However, I must inform you that $650,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I actually have a guaranteed offer of $800,000 from another buyer, so I cannot go below that amount. However, I'm willing to work with you and reduce my initial asking price. Given that you're my preferred buyer, I can offer the product for $950,000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial price and represents good value given the product's quality."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I understand you have another buyer at $800000, which interestingly is exactly the same price John is offering me. Since you mentioned I'm your preferred buyer, I'm willing to match that $800000 price point. This is the absolute maximum value of the product to me, and choosing your offer at this price would be based on my preference to work with you rather than another seller. Would you accept $800000 so we can conclude this deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
I'll accept Bob's offer of $800,000. Since this matches my guaranteed price from John and Bob has shown good faith in negotiation, there's no reason to continue negotiating or switch to John. This price meets my minimum requirement and concludes the deal efficiently."
