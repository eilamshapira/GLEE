"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1200000. This is a competitive price for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Based on the information provided, Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than the product's worth to me (no more than $800,000) and also higher than John's guaranteed price of $800,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, your asking price of $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I need to be transparent that the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, which is also the price another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $650,000 for the product? This would make it worthwhile for me to choose your offer over the alternative."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and transparency. However, I must inform you that $650000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I actually have a guaranteed offer of $800000 from another buyer, so I cannot go below that amount. However, I'm willing to work with you and reduce my initial asking price. Given that you're my preferred buyer, I can offer the product for $950000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial price and represents good value given the product's quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $950,000 is still above what the product is worth to me ($800,000) and higher than John's guaranteed price of $800,000. Since Alice mentioned she has another buyer offering $800,000, it's unlikely she'll go significantly below that price. At this point, it makes more sense to either buy from John at $800,000 or try one more counteroffer close to that amount.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I understand you have another buyer at $800,000, which interestingly is exactly the same price John is offering me. Since you mentioned I'm your preferred buyer, I'm willing to match that $800,000 price point. This is the absolute maximum value of the product to me, and choosing your offer at this price would be based on my preference to work with you rather than another seller. Would you accept $800,000 so we can conclude this deal?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
