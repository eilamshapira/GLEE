"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $9500. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is under your $10,000 limit, there's room for negotiation. You know John will sell it to you for $10,000, so you have some leverage."
