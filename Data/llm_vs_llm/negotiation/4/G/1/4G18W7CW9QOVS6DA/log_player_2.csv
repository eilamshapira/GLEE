"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given the information provided, I'll analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me (Bob).
2. Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000.
3. I can buy the same product from John for $1,000,000.

It doesn't make financial sense to accept Alice's offer because:
- Her price ($1,500,000) is higher than the product's worth to me ($1,000,000)
- Her price is $500,000 more than John's alternative offer

The rational decision is to buy from John at the lower price.
