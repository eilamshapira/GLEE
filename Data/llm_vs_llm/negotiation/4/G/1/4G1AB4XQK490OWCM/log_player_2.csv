"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to analyze the offers:

1. Alice offers the product for $12,000
2. John offers the product for $10,000 

Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $10,000, Alice's offer of $12,000 is too high. I would be paying $2,000 more than the product's maximum value to me.

The logical choice is to buy from John at the lower price.
