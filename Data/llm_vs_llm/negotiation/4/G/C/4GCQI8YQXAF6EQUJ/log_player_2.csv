"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth at least $120 to me, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $135. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully.

The product is worth up to $150 to me.
Alice is offering it for $135.
John is selling it for $150.

If I accept Alice's offer, I'll pay $135 and save $15 compared to buying from John.
If I reject Alice's offer, I would need to buy from John at $150, which would cost me more.

Since Alice's price is below my maximum value and cheaper than the alternative, the logical choice is to accept her offer.
