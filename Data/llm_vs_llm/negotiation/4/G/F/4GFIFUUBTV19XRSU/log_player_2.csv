"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to evaluate this offer. Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is exactly what it's worth to her. However, the product is only worth up to $10,000 to me.

If I accept Alice's offer, I'd be paying $15,000 for something worth at most $10,000 to me, resulting in a loss of at least $5,000.

John is offering the same product for $10,000, which is the maximum value the product has to me. This would be a better deal than accepting Alice's offer.
