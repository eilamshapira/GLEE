"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20000. I believe it's a fair price, but I'm open to negotiations.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is far above my budget. Given market conditions and my research, I can only offer $6000 for the product. This is a fair price that would work for my budget while still providing value for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $6000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's value and the fact that I have other interested buyers, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you the product for $18000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account both our interests.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $18000 is still far beyond my budget. While I understand you have other interested buyers, I need to be realistic about what I can afford. I can increase my offer to $6800, which is the absolute maximum I can go considering my budget constraints. This is a 13% increase from my previous offer, showing my sincere interest in reaching a deal.",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to increase your offer, but $6800 is still not a price I'm comfortable with. I understand that you have budget constraints, and I'm willing to make a more significant compromise. I can offer you the product for $16000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial price. I believe this price is more realistic, considering the product's value and the fact that I have other interested buyers. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial agreement.",16000.0,Alice,5,
