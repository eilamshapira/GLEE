"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20,000. I believe it's a fair price, but I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is far above my budget. Given market conditions and my research, I can only offer $6000 for the product. This is a fair price that would work for my budget while still providing value for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and even lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to compromise, but $6,000 is too low for me to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $6,000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's value and the fact that I have other interested buyers, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you the product for $18,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account both our interests."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $18000 is still far beyond my budget. While I understand you have other interested buyers, I need to be realistic about what I can afford. I can increase my offer to $6800, which is the absolute maximum I can go considering my budget constraints. This is a 13% increase from my previous offer, showing my sincere interest in reaching a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $6,800 is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. Although he has increased his offer by 13%, it's still far from my expectations. I'm not ready to sell the product at this price, especially since John is willing to pay $12,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to increase your offer, but $6,800 is still not a price I'm comfortable with. I understand that you have budget constraints, and I'm willing to make a more significant compromise. I can offer you the product for $16,000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial price. I believe this price is more realistic, considering the product's value and the fact that I have other interested buyers. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
