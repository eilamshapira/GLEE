"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20000. I believe it's a fair price, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000 and also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $8,000. It would be wise to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. If negotiations with Alice don't lead to a price below $8,000, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20,000 is far above my budget. Given market conditions and my research, I can only offer $6,000 for the product. This is a fair price that would work for my budget while still providing value for you."", ""product_price"": 6000}

Reasoning: I'm starting with an offer of $6,000 which is below my maximum value of $8,000 and John's price. This gives me room to negotiate upward if necessary while potentially securing a better deal than John's $8,000 offer. If Alice rejects this and counters with a price still above $8,000, I can always go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $6000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's value and the fact that I have other interested buyers, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you the product for $18000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: Alice's new offer of $18,000, while lower than her initial offer, is still more than twice my maximum value of $8,000. Her reduction from $20,000 to $18,000 is minimal and suggests she might not be willing to come down to my price range quickly. However, since we still have several rounds left and I always have John's $8,000 offer as a backup, I'll continue negotiating with Alice by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $18,000 is still far beyond my budget. While I understand you have other interested buyers, I need to be realistic about what I can afford. I can increase my offer to $6,800, which is the absolute maximum I can go considering my budget constraints. This is a 13% increase from my previous offer, showing my sincere interest in reaching a deal."", ""product_price"": 6800}

Reasoning: I'm slightly increasing my previous offer to show good faith in negotiations, but still keeping it well below John's price of $8,000. The increase from $6,000 to $6,800 demonstrates I'm willing to be flexible while maintaining a strong negotiating position. If Alice continues to insist on prices well above $8,000, I can still fall back on John's offer, but for now, it's worth trying to secure a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to increase your offer, but $6800 is still not a price I'm comfortable with. I understand that you have budget constraints, and I'm willing to make a more significant compromise. I can offer you the product for $16000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial price. I believe this price is more realistic, considering the product's value and the fact that I have other interested buyers. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Reasoning: At this point, it's clear that Alice and I have very different price expectations. She started at $20,000 and has only come down to $16,000 after several rounds of negotiation, while my maximum value is $8,000. Her reductions are getting smaller ($2,000 drops each time), and she continues to emphasize having other interested buyers. Even if we continued negotiating for the remaining rounds, the pattern suggests she's unlikely to come down to my price range. Given that John's offer of $8,000 is available and matches my maximum value, it's more practical to end the negotiation with Alice and take John's guaranteed offer rather than waste more time on negotiations that are unlikely to succeed."
