"Thank you for considering my counteroffer, Alice. Based on my budget and the value I see in the product, I'm offering $4000. I understand that this might be lower than your initial price, but I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",4000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $4000 is too low. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for $16000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the product's worth.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that we both need to find a fair price for this product. I'm willing to increase my offer to $6500. This is a significant increase from my previous offers, and I hope it shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Please let me know if this works for you.",6500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate the increase, but I'm afraid $6500 is still too low.
