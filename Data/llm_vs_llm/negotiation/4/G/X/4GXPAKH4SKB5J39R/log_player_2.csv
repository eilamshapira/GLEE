# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $18000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations if you're interested.

# Bob's message:
Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm looking to spend no more than $4,000 on this product. Would you be open to negotiating further? Let me know if you can come down to my price range.

The product price will be $4,000."

# Bob's message:
Alice, thank you for coming down in price, but $16,000 is still much higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm afraid I can't go much higher than my previous offer. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $6,000? I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise for both of us.

The product price will be $6,000."
