"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this excellent product, which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm asking $300. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer of $300 is significantly higher than the product's worth to me (which is no more than $80) and also higher than John's offering price of $80. Since I can immediately get the product from John for $80, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay anyway, there's no reason to accept Alice's high offer or continue negotiating.
