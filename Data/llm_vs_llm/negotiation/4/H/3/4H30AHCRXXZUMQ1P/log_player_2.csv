"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer ($12,000) is higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept it. While I could make a counteroffer, it's important to note that if Alice starts at $12,000, she might not be willing to go below $10,000. Given that I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $10,000, which is already at my maximum value, the safest and most logical decision would be to buy from John.
