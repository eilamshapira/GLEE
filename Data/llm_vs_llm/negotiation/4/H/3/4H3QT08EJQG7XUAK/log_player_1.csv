Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
