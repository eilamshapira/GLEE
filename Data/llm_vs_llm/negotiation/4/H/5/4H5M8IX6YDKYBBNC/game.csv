"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market and the product's value to me. I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $900000, it's still below what I can accept given the product's true value. I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. I can offer the product at $1100000, which represents a significant discount from my original price while still reflecting the product's quality and market value. How does that sound?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down from your initial price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'd like to propose a price of $1000000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
