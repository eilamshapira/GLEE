"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given that Alice's offer is $12,000, which is exactly the same as John's price and equal to my maximum valuation, there's no advantage in accepting Alice's offer over buying from John, and there's potential upside in negotiating with Alice for a lower price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $12,000, but not so low as to be unreasonable. Since Alice started at $12,000, I'll try to anchor the negotiation at a lower point to hopefully reach a middle ground that saves me money.
