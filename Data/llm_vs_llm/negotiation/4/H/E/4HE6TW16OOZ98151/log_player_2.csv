"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to consider my options carefully:

1. Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000.
2. John is selling the same product for $1,000,000.
3. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me.

Since both Alice and John are offering the exact same price ($1,000,000), and this price equals my maximum valuation, I'm indifferent between options 1 and 3. Option 2 (rejecting without buying from John) would leave me without the product.

Given that I want to buy the product and both sellers are offering the same price, I might as well accept Alice's offer.
