"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have an exclusive product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $12000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than my maximum budget of $15,000, and I want to save as much money as possible, I will consider this a good deal.
