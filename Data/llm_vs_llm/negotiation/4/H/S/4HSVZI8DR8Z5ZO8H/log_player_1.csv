(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is lower than my minimum acceptable price and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

My counteroffer will be $1,100,000.

I will reject Bob's offer and make a new counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $1,075,000, which is still lower than Bob's value for the product, but higher than his current offer.

I will reject Bob's offer and make a new counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous one, to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle.

My counteroffer will be $1,072,000.

Bob's offer is higher than what I can get from John, and it's likely that I won't be able to get a significantly better deal from Bob in the remaining rounds.

I will accept Bob's offer.
