"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $10000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $17500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the unique value it offers. What do you say?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $17500 is still too high for me. I can go up to $11000, which is close to my maximum budget. Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While $11000 is still below my desired price, I'm willing to be flexible and come down to $15500. This would allow me to close the deal and you to acquire a product that offers significant value. Let me know your thoughts.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15500 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $11500. This is the best I can do while staying within my budget. Let me know if this works for you.",11500.0,Bob,6,
