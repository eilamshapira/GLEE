"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be really interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. The product sounds interesting, but that's a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Considering my goal is to earn as much as possible, and the product is worth at least $100 to me, I have a tough choice. I could accept Bob's offer immediately, or I could try to negotiate for a higher price. However, I also have the option to sell the product to John for $100.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll take a calculated risk and try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping for a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $150?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
