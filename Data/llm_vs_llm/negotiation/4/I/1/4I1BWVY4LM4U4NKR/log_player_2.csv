"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $14,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: $15,000

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and:
- The product is worth up to $15,000 to me
- Alice's offer ($14,000) is less than John's price ($15,000)
- Alice's offer is still within my maximum value ($15,000)

The best option is to accept Alice's offer as it saves me $1,000 compared to buying from John.
