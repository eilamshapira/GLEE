"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given the information provided:

- I (Bob) value the product at no more than $1,200,000
- Alice is offering to sell it for $1,650,000
- John is willing to sell the same product for $1,200,000

Alice's price ($1,650,000) exceeds both my maximum valuation and John's price. Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, the logical choice is to buy from John.
