"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price point that is significantly lower. I am willing to purchase the product for $400000.",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $400000 is simply not a viable price for me.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1750000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair negotiation. Let's keep talking.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1750000 is still quite high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $500000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I hope it shows my commitment to finding a fair price.",500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, your offer is still significantly below what I need to consider. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $1000000. This is a substantial discount from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair value.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
