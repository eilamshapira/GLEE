Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price point that is significantly lower. I am willing to purchase the product for $400000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. I need to try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $400,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,750,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair negotiation. Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1750000 is still quite high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $500000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I hope it shows my commitment to finding a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000

While Bob is showing some flexibility, his offer is still significantly below my minimum. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, especially with John's offer being so close."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is still significantly below what I need to consider. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $1,000,000.
