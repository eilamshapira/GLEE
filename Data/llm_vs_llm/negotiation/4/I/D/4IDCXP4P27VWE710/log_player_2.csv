"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to make a decision about Alice's offer of $12,000 for the product.

Looking at my options:
- The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
- Alice is offering it for $12,000, which is above my maximum value
- John is willing to sell the same product for $10,000

Alice's price is $2,000 higher than John's price, and exceeds what the product is worth to me. It makes no financial sense to accept this offer.

I should either reject and negotiate with Alice or just buy from John. Since John's price matches my maximum valuation and is guaranteed, the most efficient choice is to buy from John.
