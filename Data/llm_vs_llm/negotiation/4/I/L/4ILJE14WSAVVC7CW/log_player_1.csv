Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1000000 is well above what I'm looking to spend on this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I would like to make a counteroffer of $700000. This is a fair price that would still provide you with a reasonable return. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
