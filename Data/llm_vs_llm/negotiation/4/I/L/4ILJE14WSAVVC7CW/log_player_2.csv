"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I am excited to discuss the possibility of selling you my product. I believe it holds great value for both of us. I would like to offer it to you for $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for $800,000, Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is clearly too high. Since Alice's initial offer is significantly above my maximum value, I should reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation, considering that the product is worth $800,000 to Alice.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,000,000 is well above what I'm looking to spend on this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I would like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. This is a fair price that would still provide you with a reasonable return."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. However, I believe the value of this product is higher. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $850000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's new offer of $850,000 is still higher than John's price of $800,000, and John's price is already at my maximum value threshold, it makes more sense to buy from John. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a better price, and we might waste time only to end up paying more than necessary.
