"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $180. It's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to evaluate Alice's offer against my options.

Alice is offering the product for $180, which is significantly higher than what it's worth to me (no more than $120). 

I could:
1. Accept Alice's offer at $180 (this would exceed my value threshold)
2. Reject and make a counteroffer
3. Buy from John for $120

Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum valuation ($120), and Alice's offer is much higher than that, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
