Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your initial offer. However, given my current budget and a competitive offer available elsewhere at $800000, I'm prepared to offer $600000 for your product. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

# Message to Bob:
Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your position, I'm afraid $600,000 is significantly lower lower than the lowest price I can accept or the product's value. I understand that you have another competitive offer, but I assure you that our product is superior in quality and value. As a counteroffer and to show our commitment to reaching an agreement, let's go to the next round and negotiate the price."
