"Alice, your product seems great, but $25000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. This is my absolute maximum, as I have another option available for that price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is too low. Given the product's value, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $22000.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $22000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to go with my other option.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but I still need to get a reasonable price for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further. Considering this is getting down to the wire, I'll offer it to you for $19000. This is the lowest I can go.",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $19000 is still too high. I'm willing to go to $12000, but that's my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll unfortunately have to move on to my other option.",12000.0,Bob,6,
