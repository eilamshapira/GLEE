"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. Based on its value and unique features, I'm offering it to you for $25,000."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems great, but $25000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. This is my absolute maximum, as I have another option available for that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a tough one. $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum, but I'm only at round 2. I need to gauge Bob's willingness to pay more.

Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is too low. Given the product's value, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $22,000."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $22000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to go with my other option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is getting closer to a critical point. $10,000 is still below my minimum, but Bob is saying it's his final offer. I need to assess my options.

Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but I still need to get a reasonable price for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further. Considering this is getting down to the wire, I'll offer it to you for $19,000. This is the lowest I can go."", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $19000 is still too high. I'm willing to go to $12000, but that's my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll unfortunately have to move on to my other option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","$12,000 is still below my minimum. Bob seems firm. I'm halfway through my rounds. While I'd prefer to make more, selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a profit and protects me from potentially losing even more.

Here's my decision:
