"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that my initial price might have been a bit steep, but I believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering your interest, I'm making a counteroffer of $1000000. I think this price reflects the product's worth more accurately while still being open to your considerations.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but that's still a bit too high for my budget. I can offer $700000. I believe that's a fair offer, considering the market value and my interest in the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and the fact that you've increased your offer to $700000. It shows me that you're genuinely interested in the product. However, I still need to ensure that I'm getting a fair price for it. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but not as low as $700000. I'm making a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the product's true value. I'm hoping we can meet at this price or discuss further if needed.",900000.0,Alice,5,
