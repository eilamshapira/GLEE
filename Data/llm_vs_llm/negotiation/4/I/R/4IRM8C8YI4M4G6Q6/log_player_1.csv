Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600000 for it.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a mutually beneficial price. My counteroffer will be $1,000,000. This price is still below my minimum acceptable value but higher than Bob's initial offer, giving him room to negotiate while I try to maximize my earnings."

Bob's offer:

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since he has increased his offer to $700,000, it shows he is serious about purchasing the product. My next counteroffer will be $900,000. This price is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000 but is closer to what I'm aiming for, and it gives Bob another chance to consider the purchase at a price that I believe is more reflective of the product's value."

It shows me that you're genuinely interested in the product. However, I still need to ensure that I'm getting a fair price for it. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but not as low as $700,000. I'm making a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the product's true value. I'm hoping we can meet at this price or discuss further if needed."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
