Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that my initial price might have been a bit steep, but I believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering your interest, I'm making a counteroffer of $1000000. I think this price reflects the product's worth more accurately while still being open to your considerations.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and the fact that you've increased your offer to $700000. It shows me that you're genuinely interested in the product. However, I still need to ensure that I'm getting a fair price for it. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but not as low as $700000. I'm making a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the product's true value. I'm hoping we can meet at this price or discuss further if needed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

While Alice is coming down, it's clear she is trying to stay well above my budget. It's not worth continuing to negotiate when I have a guaranteed offer for $800,000 from John."
