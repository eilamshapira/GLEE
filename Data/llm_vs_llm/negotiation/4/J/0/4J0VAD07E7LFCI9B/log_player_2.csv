"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider my options here. Alice is offering the product at $150, which is the maximum value I'm willing to pay based on my constraints. John is also offering the product at $150, so there's no advantage to buying from him over Alice at this point.

Since I can still negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, and potentially get the product for less than $150, I should reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round where I can make a counteroffer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has lowered her price to $140, which is below my maximum value of $150 and below John's fixed price of $150. This is a better offer, but I might still be able to negotiate for an even better price. Since I can make another counteroffer with no penalty, I should try to negotiate further.
