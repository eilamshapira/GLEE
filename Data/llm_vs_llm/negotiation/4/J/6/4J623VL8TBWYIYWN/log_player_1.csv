"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I need to start with a price that might be acceptable to Bob while also giving me room to negotiate downwards if needed. Since the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me and I have John's offer as a backup, I'll start with a higher price.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I see that Bob's offer is far below my reservation price of $1,500,000. His initial offer of $600,000 suggests we're quite far apart in our valuations. I need to come down from my initial offer but remain well above my minimum acceptable price.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I notice Bob is gradually increasing his offers, which is a positive sign. He's moved from $600,000 to $900,000 and now to $1,050,000. This suggests he may have room to go higher, but we're still below my reservation price of $1,500,000. Let me reduce my asking price a bit more to continue the negotiation momentum.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob has only increased his offer by $50,000 this time, suggesting he might be approaching his limit. We're in round 9 of 10, so time is running short.
