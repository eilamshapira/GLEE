,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I do see the value in your product, $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is the maximum I can offer. Let me know if you're open to that price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product is worth more than $8000. I'm willing to slightly lower the price to $18000, which is more in line with its value. Let me know if you're interested at this price.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm still firm at my initial offer of $8000.  If you're not willing to come down to that, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that $18000 is still out of your budget. I'm willing to make a further concession and meet you halfway. I'll offer the product for $15000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. If you're interested in the product, I hope you'll consider this offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, $15000 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to come up to $10000, but that's the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,6,
