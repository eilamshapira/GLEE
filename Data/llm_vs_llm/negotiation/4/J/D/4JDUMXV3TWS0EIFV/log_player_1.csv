Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I do see the value in your product, $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is the maximum I can offer. Let me know if you're open to that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. My counteroffer will be $18,000. This price still reflects the product's value and gives Bob a chance to reconsider his budget. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product is worth more than $8,000. I'm willing to slightly lower the price to $18,000, which is more in line with its value. Let me know if you're interested at this price.""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm still firm at my initial offer of $8000.  If you're not willing to come down to that, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $8,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Since Bob is firm at $8,000, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my previous counteroffer. My new counteroffer will be $15,000, which is a compromise and gives Bob a chance to reconsider his budget.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I understand that $18,000 is still out of your budget. I'm willing to make a further concession and meet you halfway. I'll offer the product for $15,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. If you're interested in the product, I hope you'll consider this offer."", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, $15000 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to come up to $10000, but that's the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob's maximum offer is $10,000, which is below the $12,000 that John is willing to pay, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John. This ensures that I get a higher price for the product than Bob's maximum offer."
