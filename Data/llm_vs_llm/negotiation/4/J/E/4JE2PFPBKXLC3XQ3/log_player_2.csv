"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to evaluate whether Alice's offer is the best option for me, or if I should try to negotiate further, or buy from John.

Alice is offering the product for $120, which is $30 less than John's price of $150. Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, Alice's offer already gives me a good value.

I could try to negotiate with Alice by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer, but there's a risk that we might not reach an agreement. Given that Alice's initial offer is already reasonable at $120, it makes sense to accept it rather than risk losing the deal.
