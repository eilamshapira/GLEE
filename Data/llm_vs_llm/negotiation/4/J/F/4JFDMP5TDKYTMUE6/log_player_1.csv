"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $250. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $250 is quite high for me. I'm looking to spend no more than $100. Can you do any better? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $70 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is much too low for this product. Given its quality and value, I cannot go below $200. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand where you're coming from, but $200 is still too high for me. I can come up to $80. How about that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Given that Bob's offers are consistently well below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and he's only increased his offer by $10 (from $70 to $80), it seems unlikely that we'll reach a mutually acceptable price. Therefore, I'll take the guaranteed $150 from John rather than continue negotiations that may not lead to a satisfactory outcome."
