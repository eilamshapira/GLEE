"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $250. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Let's see if Alice can lower her price. $250 is way above the budget of $100.)

You: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $250 is quite high for me. I'm looking to spend no more than $100. Can you do any better?"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $250 is quite high for me. I'm looking to spend no more than $100. Can you do any better?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is much too low for this product. Given its quality and value, I cannot go below $200. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Alice is still offering a price much higher than my budget. Let's see if she can come down further.)

You: Alice, I understand where you're coming from, but $200 is still too high for me. I can come up to $80. How about that?"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand where you're coming from, but $200 is still too high for me. I can come up to $80. How about that?"",
