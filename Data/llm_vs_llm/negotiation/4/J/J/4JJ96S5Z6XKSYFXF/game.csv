"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'd like to start the negotiation at $14500.",14500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $14500 is a bit steep for me. The product is worth about $12000 to me, and I know there are similar options on the market. I'd like to offer $12800 for it. This gives you a reasonable profit while still being a fair price for me. What do you think?",12800.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $12800. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13800. This price still gives you a great deal on the product, and it's closer to its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if this price works for you.",13800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. Your offer of $13800 is better, but still higher than what I'm comfortable with. I understand you need to make a profit, and I want this to be fair for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $13300? This gives you a good return on your investment while allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you say?",13300.0,Bob,4,
