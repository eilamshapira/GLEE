"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for a competitive price. If you're interested, please let me know. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to consider my options carefully. 

The product is worth $10,000 to me (maximum value I place on it).
Alice is offering it for $11,999, which is more than its value to me.
John (spelled ""Jhon"" in the options) is willing to sell it for $10,000, which exactly matches my maximum valuation.

Since I want to buy the product but save as much money as possible, and Alice's price exceeds what the product is worth to me, the rational choice is to buy from John.
