Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking of a price that's more within my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer that I believe is reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $4,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and I believe the product is worth more. I'll try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 

My counteroffer: $15,000"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your new offer. I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I still think we can find a better price that suits both of us. I'd like to make another counteroffer that's a bit higher than my previous one, but still within my budget.

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $6,000 is still lower than I'm comfortable with. However, I'll try to meet him halfway and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your new offer. I think we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial price. However, I still think $12000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer that's higher than my previous one, but still within my comfort zone. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob's latest offer of $7,000 is still lower than the $10,000 I can get from John, and we've been negotiating for several rounds without reaching a mutually acceptable price, I think it's time to consider selling to John. The difference between Bob's offer and John's offer is significant, and I don't want to risk going further down in price. Selling to John guarantees me a higher price, which is closer to the product's value."
