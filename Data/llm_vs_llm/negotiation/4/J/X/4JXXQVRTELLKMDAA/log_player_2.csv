"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. Please let me know if you'd like to accept this offer or if you have a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me think about this strategically:

1. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
2. John's offer is $12,000 (my fallback option)
3. Alice's offer is $10,000, which is:
   - Below my maximum value ($12,000)
   - $2,000 less than John's offer
   - A reasonable starting point

However, since this is just the first round and Alice's opening offer, there might be room to negotiate for an even better price. It's worth trying to get a lower price since we have 9 more rounds remaining.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's lower than Alice's $10,000 but not so low as to be offensive. Since Alice started at $10,000, I'll try to negotiate down to around $8,000 as a starting point.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. Given the value of this product, I'd like to offer it at $9000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let's analyze the situation:

1. Alice has moved down from $10,000 to $9,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This is $3,000 less than John's price ($12,000)
3. We still have 7 rounds left
4. The reduction from $10,000 to $9,000 is significant
5. Alice might be willing to go a bit lower, but probably not much more

While we could try to negotiate further, $9,000 is already a good price (25% less than our maximum value). There's a risk that if we push too hard, we might end up with a worse deal or have to go with John's higher price.
