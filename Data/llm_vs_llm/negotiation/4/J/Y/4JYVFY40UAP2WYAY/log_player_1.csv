Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic decision about the price I offer to Bob. Bob values the product at $1,500,000, and I won't accept less than $1,200,000. If Bob rejects my offer, I have a guaranteed fallback of selling to John for $1,200,000.

Since the product provides $300,000 in value to Bob above my minimum price, I could potentially capture some of this surplus. However, if I price too high, Bob might reject the offer.

I'll offer a price that provides some value to Bob while maximizing my return. A price of $1,400,000 would give Bob $100,000 in surplus value while providing me with $200,000 more than my fallback option.
