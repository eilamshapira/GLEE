"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, reject it, or buy from John.

Alice is offering the product for $1,400,000.
John is offering the product for $1,500,000.
The product is worth up to $1,500,000 to me.

If I accept Alice's offer, I save $100,000 compared to buying from John.
If I reject Alice's offer, I would still need the product, so I would end up buying from John for $1,500,000.

Since Alice's offer is below my maximum valuation and saves me money compared to the alternative, I should accept it.
