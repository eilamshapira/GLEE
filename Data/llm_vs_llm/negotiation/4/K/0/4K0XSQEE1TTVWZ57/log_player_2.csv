"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'm looking for $120, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $120 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $120
3. John is also selling it for $120
4. Alice's product costs her $100

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($120), and this is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I should try to negotiate with Alice for a better price. Alice has room to lower the price since her cost is $100.

The best strategy would be to reject Alice's initial offer, which might lead her to come back with a better price. If she doesn't, I can still buy from John at $120 as a backup option.
