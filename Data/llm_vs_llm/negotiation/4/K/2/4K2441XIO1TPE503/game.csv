"Alice,  $950000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go as high as $850000. Let's see if we can find common ground there.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand you're trying to find a good price. However, considering the substantial value this product brings to you, $850000 is lower than I can accept. Let's meet in the middle. I'll come down a bit to $925000.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $925000 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can agree on.",900000.0,Bob,4,
