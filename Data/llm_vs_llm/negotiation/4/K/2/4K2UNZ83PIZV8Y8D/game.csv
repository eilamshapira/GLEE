"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1200000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling the product to me. However, I need to be transparent that $1200000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Given the market value and my budget constraints, I'm prepared to offer $700000 for the product. This would provide you with immediate liquidity and allow us to complete this transaction efficiently. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer and the open communication. I understand your position, however, the price you're offering is considerably below its true value and my initial asking price. I've done my research, and I know this product is worth a significant investment. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while still offering you a competitive advantage.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
