"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling the product to me. However, I need to be transparent that $1200000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Given the market value and my budget constraints, I'm prepared to offer $700000 for the product. This would provide you with immediate liquidity and allow us to complete this transaction efficiently. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer and the open communication. I understand your position, however, the price you're offering is considerably below its true value and my initial asking price. I've done my research, and I know this product is worth a significant investment. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while still offering you a competitive advantage."",
