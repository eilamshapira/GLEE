"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1200000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, reject it and make a counteroffer, or buy from John.

Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, but the product is only worth $800,000 to me, and I know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice as well. The current offer would mean I'd be paying $400,000 more than the product's value to me.

John is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $800,000, which matches my maximum valuation. This is clearly a better option than accepting Alice's current offer.

Rather than immediately going to John, I can try negotiating with Alice first. If I can get a price below $800,000, that would be ideal, but even matching John's price would be acceptable.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in selling the product to me. However, I need to be transparent that $1,200,000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay. I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $800,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Given the market value and my budget constraints, I'm prepared to offer $700,000 for the product. This would provide you with immediate liquidity and allow us to complete this transaction efficiently. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer and the open communication. I understand your position, however, the price you're offering is considerably below its true value and my initial asking price. I've done my research, and I know this product is worth a significant investment. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while still offering you a competitive advantage. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to carefully evaluate this updated offer from Alice.

Alice has reduced her price from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still $200,000 more than what John is offering ($800,000) and $200,000 more than what the product is worth to me.

Given that:
1. I can get the exact same product from John for $800,000
2. The product is worth $800,000 to me, so I shouldn't pay more than that
3. Alice has shown willingness to negotiate, but is still significantly above my maximum value

The most economical decision would be to either:
- Make another counteroffer to Alice, closer to $800,000
- Buy from John at $800,000

Since I have a guaranteed option with John at exactly my maximum value, and Alice's current offer would have me overpaying by $200,000, the rational choice is:
