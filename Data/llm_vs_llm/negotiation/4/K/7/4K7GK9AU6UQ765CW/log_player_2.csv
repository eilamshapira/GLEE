"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can offer you this product for $100. It's a great value for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's initial offer of $100 is at the upper limit of what I'm willing to pay, and I have the option to buy from John for the same price, I'll try to negotiate a better deal with Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll aim for a price that's significantly lower than $100.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position, but $60 is too low for me. How about we meet closer to the middle? I can offer the product for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $90 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Since she's willing to negotiate and has already come down from $100 to $90, I'll try to see if I can get her to come down even further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to meet Alice halfway between her new offer of $90 and my previous offer of $60. That would put the price at around $75. I'll make a counteroffer at that price and see if Alice is willing to accept it.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit tight on budget, so I was thinking $75 would be a more comfortable price for me. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 75}"
