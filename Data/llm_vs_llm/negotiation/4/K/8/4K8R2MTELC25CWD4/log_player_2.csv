"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given the information:
- The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
- Alice is offering the product for $15,000
- I can purchase the same product from John for $8,000

It makes the most financial sense to buy from John at $8,000 rather than accepting Alice's offer of $15,000, which is significantly above my valuation.
