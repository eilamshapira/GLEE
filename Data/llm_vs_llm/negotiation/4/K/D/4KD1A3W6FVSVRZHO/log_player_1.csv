"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm delighted to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its significant value to you and its rarity, I'm proposing a price of..."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1400000 is a bit higher than I was expecting. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is tighter than that. How about we start at $900000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Considering Bob's offer and my own valuation, I need to make a strategic decision. I could accept and make $900,000 which is a profit, but still less than my ideal. However, I also need to think about time.

Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counter offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for Round 3:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is a bit low considering the product's worth to you, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle. $1300000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to come up to $1100000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Okay, $1,100,000 is a significant increase from Bob's initial offer, but it's still below my current target. I also have to be mindful of time, as the more rounds we take the riskier it will be. Given that it is not ideal to sell to Bob at that price, I will risk it.

Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counter offer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for Round 5:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm very interested. Let's try one more time. How about $1150000? That's my best and final offer for now.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","$1,150,000 is getting closer to my target and Bob has mentioned this is his best offer. I am still not completely satisfied, but I have to consider time and risk. I also need to think that if I reject and Bob decides to walk away, I could lose the deal and would have to sell to John for $800,000, which is not ideal.

Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counter offer.
