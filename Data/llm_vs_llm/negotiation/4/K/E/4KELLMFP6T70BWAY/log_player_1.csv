Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to choose a price that will maximize my earnings from selling the product. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll still get $100 from John, so I should set the price higher than that.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll set a price that gives me a good chance of making more than my guaranteed $100, while not being so high that Bob is likely to reject it.
