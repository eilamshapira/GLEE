"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll find our price of $1600000 quite reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,200,000, I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range. This will give us room to negotiate and potentially find a mutually acceptable price.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I want to be flexible. Let's meet halfway between your last offer and ours. Let's set the price at $1400000. I think this price reflects the value and benefits that the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,400,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. While I appreciate her willingness to negotiate, I'm not ready to accept this price.

I'll reject the offer again and make another counteroffer, trying to bring the price closer to my target.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $1,400,000, and I previously offered $800,000, I'll try to split the difference and make a more reasonable counteroffer. I'll increase my previous offer by $200,000 to show that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable price.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, I still think the price can be more competitive. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $1,000,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're trying to find a middle ground here. I'm willing to lower my previous offer to $1250000. This price is very competitive and ensures that both parties are benefiting from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my maximum budget of $1,200,000, but it's still slightly above it. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, I don't see a compelling reason to accept Alice's offer.

I'll reject the offer again and consider making another counteroffer, or I might choose to buy from John if the negotiations don't progress further in my favor.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $1,250,000, and I know that I can buy the product from John for $1,200,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my maximum budget. I'll offer $1,150,000, which is still lower than Alice's last offer, but shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable price.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our previous offers, and I'll offer $1,150,000. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
