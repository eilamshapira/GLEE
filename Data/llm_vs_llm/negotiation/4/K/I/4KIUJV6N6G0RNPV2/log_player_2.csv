"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $1200000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I should evaluate Alice's offer of $1,200,000 compared to my maximum value of $1,500,000 and John's fixed price of $1,500,000.

Alice's price is $300,000 less than my maximum value and John's price, which is a 20% savings. This is a good offer that leaves significant surplus for me. Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible while still acquiring the product, and Alice's initial offer is already substantially below my maximum, it makes sense to accept.
