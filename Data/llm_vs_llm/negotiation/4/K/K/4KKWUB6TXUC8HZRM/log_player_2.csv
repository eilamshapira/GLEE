"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $12000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. While I could make a counteroffer, since John is already offering the product at my maximum value point, it's most rational to go with the guaranteed option.
