Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. The product is worth $150 to Bob and $100 to me. Since Bob can make counteroffers, I'll start a bit high to leave room for negotiation, but not so high that he'll immediately reject it.

{""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob's offer of $125 is significantly better than John's $100
2. While I could try to counter with a higher price, there's a risk Bob might lower his offer or walk away
3. $125 is a good profit margin from my minimum of $100
4. Accepting now ensures a good profit without risking further negotiation
