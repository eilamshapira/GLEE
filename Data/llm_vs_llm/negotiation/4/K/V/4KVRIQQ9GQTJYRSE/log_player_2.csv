"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, Iâ€™m offering you this premium product for $15000. Please let me know if you accept this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Based on the information provided:

1. The product is worth at most $10,000 to you.
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $15,000.
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $10,000.

Since Alice's price ($15,000) exceeds both your maximum valuation ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000), the rational decision would be to buy from John instead.
