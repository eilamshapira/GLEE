"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for round 1:

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Considering Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below what the product is worth to me ($150), I'll reject it. I need to try for a higher price.

Therefore: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for round 3:

{""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Again, $75 is still far less than what I need to make this a worthwhile deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and keep trying to get a better price.

Therefore: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer for round 5:

{""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","At this point, I'm in a tough spot. I've tried to get a higher price, but Bob is consistently low. $80 is the absolute *maximum* value the product has to him, so if I try to get a higher price in round 7, he will definitely reject it.

I also have to consider that I can sell it to John for $150. Since I can only keep negotiating for 4 more rounds, it's wise to secure a definite deal now.

Therefore: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, I'm going to try one last time.

{""product_price"": 155}"
