Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. Since I know:
1. The product is worth no less than $10,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000
3. The product is worth $8,000 to Bob

There's no reason for me to sell below $10,000 since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price. However, I'll start slightly higher to leave room for negotiation, while still being somewhat reasonable.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is an easy decision. Bob's offer of $6,000 is well below both:
1. My minimum acceptable price ($10,000)
2. The guaranteed offer from John ($10,000)
3. Even below Bob's own valuation ($8,000)

Since I can sell to John for $10,000, and Bob's offer is significantly lower, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Bob.
