"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to consider my options carefully:

1. Accept Alice's offer of $900,000
2. Reject and make a counteroffer
3. Buy from John for $800,000

Alice is offering the product for $900,000, which is $100,000 more than what it's worth to me ($800,000). John is willing to sell it for exactly $800,000.

Since Alice's initial offer exceeds my maximum price point, and I have the option to buy from John at my maximum price, I should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price. If we can't reach an agreement, I always have the fallback option to buy from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but still gives me room to negotiate. Given that Alice values the product at $800,000, I'll start with an offer below that to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": $700,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her price from $900,000 to $880,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still $80,000 above what the product is worth to me and what John is offering.

Since I have the guaranteed option to buy from John at $800,000, and Alice's current offer is still above that price, it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a price below $800,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down $20,000 from her initial offer, I'll increase my offer but still aim for a price that would be advantageous to me compared to John's $800,000 option.

{""product_price"": $740,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has now lowered her price to $850,000, which is getting closer but is still $50,000 above what John is offering and what the product is worth to me.

Since Alice has been progressively lowering her price (from $900,000 to $880,000 to $850,000), it suggests she may be willing to come down further. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can reach a price below $800,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has reduced her price by $30,000 in this round, showing she's continuing to make meaningful concessions. I'll increase my offer accordingly while still aiming for a better price than John's $800,000.

{""product_price"": $770,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $830,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $830,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer is now $830,000, which is still $30,000 more than John's price of $800,000. Alice has been consistently lowering her price throughout our negotiation (from $900,000 to $880,000 to $850,000 and now to $830,000).

With 3 rounds left after this one, and seeing that Alice is gradually approaching the $800,000 mark, it makes sense to continue negotiating to try to get a price below what John is offering.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has reduced her price by $20,000 in this round. We're making good progress, but still haven't reached a price better than John's $800,000. With a few rounds remaining, I'll increase my offer again but still aim for a price advantageous to me.
