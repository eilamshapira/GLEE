"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $145. This is a fair price considering what similar products are going for in the market. Would you like to proceed with this purchase?",145.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate that your price is below market rate, I think we can find a more mutually beneficial arrangement. The product is worth $130 to me, and I'd be willing to pay that price. This would still give you a good profit margin while providing me with value. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in finding a mutually beneficial arrangement. However, I need to be transparent that my minimum acceptable price is higher than $130. Given the quality and value of this product, I can offer it to you for $140. This is still a good deal compared to the market value of $150, giving you a $10 savings while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Would this work for you?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking for a better deal than just $10 off the market price. Given that I have other options, I'd like to propose $135 for the product. This gives you a reasonable profit while offering me enough savings to make the deal worthwhile. How does that sound?",135.0,Bob,4,
