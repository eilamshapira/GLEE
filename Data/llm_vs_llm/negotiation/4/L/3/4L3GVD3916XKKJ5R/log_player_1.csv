Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $145.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate that your price is below market rate, I think we can find a more mutually beneficial arrangement. The product is worth $130 to me, and I'd be willing to pay that price. This would still give you a good profit margin while providing me with value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in finding a mutually beneficial arrangement.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Given that I have other options, I'd like to propose $135 for the product. This gives you a reasonable profit while offering me enough savings to make the deal worthwhile. How does that sound?
