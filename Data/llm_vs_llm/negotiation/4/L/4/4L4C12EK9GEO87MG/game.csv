"Hi Bob, I hope you're doing well. I have a product that I think would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $300. This product is high-quality and worth every penny. Let me know if you're interested in purchasing it at this price.",300.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. However, I think $300 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand budget concerns, I can't go as low as $100 as the product is worth significantly more. I could come down to $250, which is already quite a reduction from my initial offer. The quality and value you'll receive definitely justifies this price. Would this work better for you?",250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $175?",175.0,Bob,4,
