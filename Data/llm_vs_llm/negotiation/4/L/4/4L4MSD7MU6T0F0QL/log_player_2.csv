"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for a special price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $80 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $100
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $80
4. If I buy from Alice at $100, I'll be paying $20 more than my maximum value
5. John's offer matches my maximum value

Since Alice's offer ($100) is above my maximum value ($80), and John offers the same product at exactly my maximum value ($80), the rational decision would be to buy from John.
