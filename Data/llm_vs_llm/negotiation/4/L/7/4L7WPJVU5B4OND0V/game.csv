"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $11500 is a bit high for my budget. I know this product has great value, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10500. This would still provide you with a good profit while helping me stay within my budget constraints. Would you be able to meet me at this price point?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, after considering your offer, I'm willing to lower my price to $11000. This price takes into account both our interests, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Hope you agree to this new offer.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. That shows good faith in our negotiation. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10750. This gives you a meaningful profit above your $10000 cost while allowing me to stay comfortably within my budget. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both. What do you say?",10750.0,Bob,4,
