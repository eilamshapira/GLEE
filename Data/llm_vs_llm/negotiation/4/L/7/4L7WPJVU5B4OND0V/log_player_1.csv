Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $11500 is a bit high for my budget. I know this product has great value, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10500. This would still provide you with a good profit while helping me stay within my budget constraints. Would you be able to meet me at this price point?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
