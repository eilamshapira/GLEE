"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11500. It's a great value and I hope you find this price suitable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to consider Alice's offer of $11,500 against my alternatives. The product is worth up to $12,000 to me, so Alice's offer is below my maximum value. However, I can try to negotiate for a better price since the product is only worth $10,000 to Alice, giving us room to negotiate.

If I reject this offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially save more money. If negotiations fail, I can always buy from John at $12,000 as a backup.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $11,500 is a bit high for my budget. I know this product has great value, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500. This would still provide you with a good profit while helping me stay within my budget constraints. Would you be able to meet me at this price point?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after considering your offer, I'm willing to lower my price to $11000. This price takes into account both our interests, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Hope you agree to this new offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has come down from $11,500 to $11,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is $1,000 less than my maximum value of $12,000, and certainly better than John's fixed price of $12,000. However, since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, there might still be room for negotiation to get a better price.

I should continue negotiating to try to save more money, but with a more reasonable counteroffer that acknowledges Alice's movement.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. That shows good faith in our negotiation. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,750. This gives you a meaningful profit above your $10,000 cost while allowing me to stay comfortably within my budget. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}"
