(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer is at the minimum value I'm willing to accept ($8,000), I'll consider my options carefully. However, I believe I can get a better price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.
