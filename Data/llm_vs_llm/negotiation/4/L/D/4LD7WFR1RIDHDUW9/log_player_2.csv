"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to consider the options carefully.

Alice is offering to sell the product for $1,200,000.
The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me.
If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for the same price: $1,200,000.

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($1,200,000), and this price equals the maximum value the product has to me, I'm indifferent between options 1 and 3. However, since Alice has presented her offer first, I'll accept her offer.
