"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,200,000
2. Alice's offer is $1,000,000, which is below my maximum
3. Alice's cost is $800,000, so there might be room for negotiation
4. John's price ($1,200,000) is higher than Alice's current offer

The initial offer of $1,000,000 seems high compared to Alice's cost ($800,000), so there might be room to negotiate a better price. However, it's significantly better than John's price of $1,200,000.

Since I can still negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's between Alice's cost ($800,000) and her initial offer ($1,000,000).

I'll offer $875,000, which:
1. Gives Alice a $75,000 profit over her cost
2. Saves me $125,000 compared to her initial offer
3. Is much better than John's price of $1,200,000
4. Leaves room for future negotiation if needed

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. Alice reduced her price from $1,000,000 to $950,000
2. This represents a $50,000 reduction from her initial offer
3. She rejected my $875,000 offer, but showed willingness to negotiate
4. $950,000 is still significantly better than John's price of $1,200,000
5. Alice has moved $50,000 while I tried to move $125,000 - she's showing less flexibility

While there might still be room for negotiation, Alice's movement suggests she won't go much lower. The current offer of $950,000 is a good price:
- It saves me $250,000 compared to John's price
- It gives Alice a reasonable profit
- Further negotiation might risk losing goodwill

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer.
