Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically.

I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price. This gives me a strong position and a solid fallback option.

Since I don't know Bob's maximum valuation, but I want to maximize my profit, I should set a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. However, I need to be careful not to set it so high that it's immediately rejected.

I'll set the price at $1,200,000, which is a 50% premium over my minimum price. This gives room for significant profit while still being potentially acceptable to Bob if he values the product highly.
