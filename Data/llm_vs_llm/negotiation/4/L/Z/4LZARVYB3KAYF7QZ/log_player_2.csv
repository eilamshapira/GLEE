"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer is the same price as what I can get from John, and it's already at the maximum value I'm willing to pay, there's no benefit in rejecting the offer to try to negotiate a better price or to buy from John, as the price would be the same. Therefore, the most straightforward decision is to accept Alice's offer.
