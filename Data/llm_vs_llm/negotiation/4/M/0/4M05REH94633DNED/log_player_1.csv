Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. Considering its exceptional quality and rarity, I'm offering it to you for $25,000."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product! While it seems nice,  $25000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counter_offer"": 20000}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the quick response, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a little on the price.  To be honest, $20000 is still quite a ways from what I had in mind. Would you consider $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough spot. Bob is offering $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm hoping to get more.

Given the risk of losing the sale entirely and the fact that I have a guaranteed $10,000 from John, I'll accept Bob's offer.
