Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2,500,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the unique value of the product, but $2500000 is beyond what I am willing to pay. Considering my budget and market alternatives, I would like to propose a price of $1200000. I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is lower than what I can get from John ($1,500,000), and it's also lower than the product's value to me, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better price. 

Here's my counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,200,000 is below my expectations. Considering the product's unique value, I'm willing to make a concession and propose a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to further negotiations to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 2200000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I really value the opportunity to negotiate with you for this product. However, my budget constraints are significant, and I would like to offer $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering my alternatives, and I hope we can agree on this amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still lower than what I can get from John ($1,500,000), I will reject Bob's offer. However, considering that Bob's offer is getting closer to John's offer, I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob instead of immediately selling to John.

Here's my counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,400,000 reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to make another concession and propose a price of $2,000,000. If this is still not acceptable, I'm open to discussing further options."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
