"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product! I know you'll find it incredibly valuable. Are you interested in purchasing it for $175? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Looking at the information:

1. The product is worth no more than $150 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $175
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $150

Since Alice's price ($175) exceeds both the value I place on the product ($150) and John's offer ($150), the logical choice is to buy from John instead. This saves me $25 compared to Alice's offer while still getting the product I want.
