"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

{""product_price"": 2,800,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $600,000 as it's significantly below even my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 (John's offer).

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round, lowering my initial price but still maintaining a position well above my minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price significantly from my initial offer but still maintain a strong position well above my minimum threshold.

{""product_price"": 2,200,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $800,000 is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. Since we've already gone through 4 rounds and Bob has only increased his offer by $200,000, showing limited movement toward a reasonable price, and we're already approaching the halfway point of our 10-round limit, I believe it's time to be prudent.
