"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product has significant value, but $2500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I must decline your offer of $800000. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I'm giving you priority because I believe you could derive even greater value from it. I can come down to $1800000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of this premium product. Would you consider this revised offer?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price. However, $1800000 is still a bit steep for me. Considering you mentioned the product is worth at least $1000000 to you, I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. This price reflects a serious commitment from my side, and I believe it's a fair offer given the circumstances.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer matching my minimum acceptable value. While I could sell to John for the same price, I believe this product would be more valuable in your hands. However, I need to see some additional value beyond my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down significantly to $1300000, which I believe is fair considering the product's true market value. This represents almost a 50% reduction from my initial offer. Can we reach an agreement at this price?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price further. I understand that you believe the product would be more valuable in my hands, and I agree. However, $1300000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my serious interest in acquiring it. I hope we can meet at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
