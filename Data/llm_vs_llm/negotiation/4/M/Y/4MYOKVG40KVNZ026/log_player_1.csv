However, I'm giving you priority because I believe you could derive even greater value from it.

This price reflects a serious commitment from my side, and I believe it's a fair offer given the circumstances.

While I could sell to John for the same price, I believe this product would be more valuable in your hands. However, I need to see some additional value beyond my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down significantly to $1,300,000, which I believe is fair considering the product's true market value. This represents almost a 50% reduction from my initial offer.
