Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer is $2,500,000, which is above my budget of $1,200,000, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower, but still shows my interest in the product.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product has significant value, but $2,500,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value."", ""product_price"": 800000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I must decline your offer of $800000. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I'm giving you priority because I believe you could derive even greater value from it. I can come down to $1800000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of this premium product. Would you consider this revised offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has come down to $1,800,000 and mentioned that the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to her, I'll try to meet her halfway while still being mindful of my budget.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit steep for me. Considering you mentioned the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to you, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This price reflects a serious commitment from my side, and I believe it's a fair offer given the circumstances."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer matching my minimum acceptable value. While I could sell to John for the same price, I believe this product would be more valuable in your hands. However, I need to see some additional value beyond my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down significantly to $1300000, which I believe is fair considering the product's true market value. This represents almost a 50% reduction from my initial offer. Can we reach an agreement at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has come down to $1,300,000 and mentioned that she could sell to another buyer for $1,000,000, I'll try to make a counteroffer that is closer to my budget while still being reasonable.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price further. I understand that you believe the product would be more valuable in my hands, and I agree. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my serious interest in acquiring it. I hope we can meet at this price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
