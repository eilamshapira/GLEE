"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $120. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While Alice's offer is equal to your maximum price, there's a chance she might be willing to lower it. It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal before settling for $120."
