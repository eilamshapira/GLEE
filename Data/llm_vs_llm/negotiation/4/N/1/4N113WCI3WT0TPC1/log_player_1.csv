Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have this great product I think you'd really like. How about I offer it to you for $150?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, let's analyze this. Bob's offer is for $85. I know the product is worth at least $120 to me, and selling to John would get me $120.

Since I can get more money selling to John, I will choose to sell to him.
