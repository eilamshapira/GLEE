{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment for you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a price closer to your $1,200,000 fallback.
* **John as Leverage:** While not explicitly stated, the presence of John provides a strong bargaining position. Bob might be more inclined to accept a higher price knowing the alternative is you selling it at your desired price.
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:**  Offering it slightly below your guaranteed price with John acknowledges there's room for Bob to profit, encouraging him to consider the deal seriously."
