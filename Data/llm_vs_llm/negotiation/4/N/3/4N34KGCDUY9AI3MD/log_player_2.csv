"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: Alice's offer of $15,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's alternative price ($12,000). It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer as I would be losing money. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a better price. If negotiations don't progress favorably, I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9000}

Reasoning: Since I know the product is worth $12,000 to me and John is offering it at that price, I'll start with a lower offer of $9,000. This gives room for negotiation while potentially saving money compared to John's price. If Alice accepts, I'll save $3,000 compared to buying from John. If she counters, we can still negotiate up to a maximum of $12,000 before I would switch to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Reasoning: Alice has now matched John's price of $12,000, which is also my maximum value for the product. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might increase her price again or become unwilling to negotiate. Since $12,000 is already my maximum acceptable price and matches the alternative option from John, it's rational to accept this offer now. There's no guarantee that continuing negotiations would result in a better price, and I might end up having to pay the same amount to John anyway."
