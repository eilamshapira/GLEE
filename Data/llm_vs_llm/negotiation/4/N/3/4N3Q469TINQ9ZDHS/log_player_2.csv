"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for sale at $200. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The offer of $200 is too high. We have room to negotiate down towards our $120 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too steep for me right now, but I'm interested. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

We're starting with a low offer to see how much wiggle room there is. It's a common negotiation tactic to start low and work up."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. Given the value of this product, I'm prepared to offer it at $140. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is closer to our budget, it's still above our $120 limit. We'll counteroffer again and try to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

We're splitting the difference between her previous offer ($140) and our previous offer ($80).  This shows a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a good deal."
