"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $50. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
