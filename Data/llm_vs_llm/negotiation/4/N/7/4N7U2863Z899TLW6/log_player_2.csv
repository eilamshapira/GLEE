"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is far too high - it's more than double my maximum value of $1,200,000. It wouldn't make sense to accept this when I can buy from John for $1,200,000. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

I'll start with an offer of $800,000, which is significantly below John's price of $1,200,000. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing me to save money compared to buying from John. If Alice rejects this, we can work toward finding a middle ground that's below John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $2,750,000 is still more than twice my maximum value of $1,200,000, and it's even higher than John's guaranteed price. The reduction from $3,000,000 to $2,750,000 is not significant enough. I'll reject and make another counteroffer to try to reach a more reasonable price. If Alice continues to make offers well above John's price, I may eventually decide to buy from John instead."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'll increase my offer to $1,000,000, which is $200,000 higher than my previous offer but still comfortably below John's price of $1,200,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate up, but I'm also maintaining a position that would save money compared to buying from John. If Alice continues to make counteroffers well above John's price, I may need to consider ending the negotiation and going with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'm choosing to buy from John because:
1. Alice's offers have remained significantly above my maximum value of $1,200,000
2. The pace of price reduction from Alice (from $3M to $2.75M to $2.5M) suggests we're unlikely to reach a price below $1.2M in the remaining rounds
3. John's guaranteed price of $1,200,000 is much better than Alice's current offer of $2,500,000
4. We've already gone through 5 rounds, and Alice's offers are still more than double John's price

It's time to end the negotiation and take the guaranteed option from John, as it's clear Alice and I are too far apart in our price expectations."
