Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product that I believe would be highly beneficial to you. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering its value to both of us."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible without losing him to John's offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation creates a win-win situation. Bob gets a good deal, and you make a significant profit above your minimum. 
* **Confident Negotiation:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value and suggesting a fair deal. This sets a confident tone for the negotiation."
