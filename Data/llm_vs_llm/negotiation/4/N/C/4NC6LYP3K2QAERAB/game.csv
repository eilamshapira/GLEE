"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $120 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $170.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $170 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145? This would be a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Bob,4,
