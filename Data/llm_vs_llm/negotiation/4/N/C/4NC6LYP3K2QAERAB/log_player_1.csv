Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product. It's a great item! I'm offering it to you for $200."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Considering Bob's offer of $120, I have a few options. While $120 is better than nothing, it's below the $150 I could get from John, and it's also below my own valuation.

Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and try for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $120 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $170."", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $170 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, Bob is now offering $145. This is getting closer! However, I can still get $150 from John. I need to decide if it's worth risking another round of negotiation with Bob, knowing I might get a slightly higher price, or if I should secure the sure thing with John.

Given that my goal is to earn as much as possible, and that I know the item is worth at least $150 to me, I will take the deal with John.
