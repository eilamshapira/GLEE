"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I can offer you a better deal, though. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $160 is still above what I'm willing to spend. Could you go down to $90? I really want to make this work.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far from your offer. I can do $145, which is the lowest I'm comfortable with. If you're interested, let me know!",145.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $145 is still too high for me. How about we settle at $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,6,
