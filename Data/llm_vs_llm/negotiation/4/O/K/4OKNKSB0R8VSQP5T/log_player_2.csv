"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $14000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
It's very unlikely Alice's first offer is her best price. We can definitely negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 10000
}
```

This counter-offer provides a significant jump from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also gives us an idea of Alice's willingness to move on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13000.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice is moving in the right direction, but we can still negotiate further. We're aiming to be significantly below John's offer to make the negotiation worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand we both want to make a fair deal here, Alice. How about $11,500? That's a reasonable compromise."",
 ""product_price"": 11500
}
```

This counteroffer shows Alice we're willing to move closer to her price, but still signals that we're looking for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's split the difference - $12500. This would be a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $12,500 is getting closer, we're still aiming to be closer to that $11,000-$11,500 range. We have room to negotiate, especially since Alice seems motivated to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Alice! Tell you what, let's make this easy - $11,750 and we have a deal."",
 ""product_price"": 11750
}
```

This offer represents a small concession from our previous offer but keeps us firmly in our desired price range. The ""let's make this easy"" tone aims to encourage Alice to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. How about we meet at $12250?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice is clearly trying to meet in the middle, but we're still not at a price where I feel comfortable accepting. One more counter offer should do the trick."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, you're really close.  I can do $12,000 even -  that's my final offer."",
 ""product_price"": 12000
}
```

This offer meets Alice at her known value for the product while still securing a discount for myself. Making it clear this is my final offer may push her to accept."
