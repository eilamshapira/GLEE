"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a higher price to test Bob's willingness to pay and leave room for negotiation.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but with a lower price than my initial offer to show some flexibility in the negotiation."
