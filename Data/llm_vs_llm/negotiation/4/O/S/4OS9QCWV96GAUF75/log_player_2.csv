"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product here, and I'm offering it to you for just $150. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given that Alice is offering the product for $150, which is more than the $120 maximum value to me, and John is willing to sell the same product for $120, it doesn't make sense to accept Alice's current offer.

I could make a counteroffer to Alice, but since John's price is already at my maximum value threshold, there's no reason to negotiate further with Alice unless she's willing to go below $120.

The most rational decision is to buy from John.
