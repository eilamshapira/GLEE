"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your product, but $10000 is at the very top of my budget and equal to what John is charging. Since I'm interested in doing business with you rather than John, I'd like to propose $8500 for the product. This gives you a good profit while saving me some money compared to my alternative option. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, and I truly value the opportunity to do business with you. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9500 is better than my alternative option with John, I believe we can find a price that works even better for both of us. I'd like to counter with $9000. This still gives you a significant profit margin over your cost of $8000, while giving me a better deal than my alternative. Does that work for you?
