"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering the product to you for $10000. It's a valuable item, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Analyzing the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me (my maximum value)
2. Alice is offering it for $10,000
3. John is also selling it for $10,000
4. The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so she has room to negotiate

Since Alice's initial offer is at my maximum price point ($10,000), and I know she values it at only $8,000, I should reject and make a counteroffer. There's no advantage to accepting immediately or buying from John at the same price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your product, but $10,000 is at the very top of my budget and equal to what John is charging. Since I'm interested in doing business with you rather than John, I'd like to propose $8,500 for the product. This gives you a good profit while saving me some money compared to my alternative option. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, and I truly value the opportunity to do business with you. How about we meet in the middle at $9500? I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has come down from $10,000 to $9,500, which is progress. This is already better than John's price of $10,000. However, since I know the product is worth only $8,000 to Alice, there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject and make another counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,500 is better than my alternative option with John, I believe we can find a price that works even better for both of us. I'd like to counter with $9,000. This still gives you a significant profit margin over your cost of $8,000, while giving me a better deal than my alternative. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
