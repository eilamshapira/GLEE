"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $17000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth and I'm open to negotiations.",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $17000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for exactly $8000. I'd prefer to do business with you if possible, so I'm offering $6000. This gives you a chance to make the sale while giving me some benefit compared to my alternative option.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, $6000 is still quite far from the product's value to me. Considering you mentioned the product is worth $8000 to you, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $14000, which is closer to my desired price but still gives you a better deal than buying from the other seller at $8000.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I think there's a misunderstanding. I didn't say the product is worth $8000 to me - that's just the price John is offering. The product actually isn't worth more than $8000 to me, which is why John's offer is my maximum alternative. Your offer of $14000 is still much higher than what makes sense for me financially. I understand the product is worth $15000 to you, but I can't justify paying more than what another seller is offering. I'm willing to offer $7000, which would give you a better deal than potentially losing the sale altogether if I go with John's offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $7000 is still below what I'm comfortable selling the product for. Considering you have an alternative option to buy the product from John for $8000, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $12000, which is lower than my initial price but still reflects the product's value to me. This way, you'll get a better deal than buying from John, and I'll get a fair price for the product.",12000.0,Alice,5,
