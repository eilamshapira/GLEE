Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $17,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth and I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $17000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for exactly $8000. I'd prefer to do business with you if possible, so I'm offering $6000. This gives you a chance to make the sale while giving me some benefit compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me ($15,000) and even lower than what he's willing to pay ($8,000), I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to reach a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, $6,000 is still quite far from the product's value to me. Considering you mentioned the product is worth $8,000 to you, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $14,000, which is closer to my desired price but still gives you a better deal than buying from the other seller at $8,000."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think there's a misunderstanding. I didn't say the product is worth $8000 to me - that's just the price John is offering. The product actually isn't worth more than $8000 to me, which is why John's offer is my maximum alternative. Your offer of $14000 is still much higher than what makes sense for me financially. I understand the product is worth $15000 to you, but I can't justify paying more than what another seller is offering. I'm willing to offer $7000, which would give you a better deal than potentially losing the sale altogether if I go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Although Bob's offer of $7,000 is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than the product's worth to me ($15,000). Given that Bob has an alternative option to buy the product from John for $8,000, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's closer to this price, while still being higher to reflect the product's value to me."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $7,000 is still below what I'm comfortable selling the product for. Considering you have an alternative option to buy the product from John for $8,000, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $12,000, which is lower than my initial price but still reflects the product's value to me. This way, you'll get a better deal than buying from John, and I'll get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
