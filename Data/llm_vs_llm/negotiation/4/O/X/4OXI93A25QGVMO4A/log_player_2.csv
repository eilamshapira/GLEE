"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $17000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth and I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The offer from Alice at $17,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($8,000) and the guaranteed alternative from John ($8,000). There's no reason to accept this offer, and it would be better to negotiate or take the alternative.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $17,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for exactly $8,000. I'd prefer to do business with you if possible, so I'm offering $6,000. This gives you a chance to make the sale while giving me some benefit compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, $6000 is still quite far from the product's value to me. Considering you mentioned the product is worth $8000 to you, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $14000, which is closer to my desired price but still gives you a better deal than buying from the other seller at $8000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice seems to have misunderstood - I didn't say the product is worth $8,000 to me (though that is my maximum), but rather that John is offering it for $8,000. Her offer of $14,000 is still significantly above both my maximum valuation and the alternative option from John. There's no reason to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I think there's a misunderstanding. I didn't say the product is worth $8,000 to me - that's just the price John is offering. The product actually isn't worth more than $8,000 to me, which is why John's offer is my maximum alternative. Your offer of $14,000 is still much higher than what makes sense for me financially. I understand the product is worth $15,000 to you, but I can't justify paying more than what another seller is offering. I'm willing to offer $7,000, which would give you a better deal than potentially losing the sale altogether if I go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $7000 is still below what I'm comfortable selling the product for. Considering you have an alternative option to buy the product from John for $8000, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $12000, which is lower than my initial price but still reflects the product's value to me. This way, you'll get a better deal than buying from John, and I'll get a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice is still completely misunderstanding my position. Her offer of $12,000 is higher than both my maximum valuation and John's alternative price of $8,000. There's no reason for me to pay more than the $8,000 that John is offering, especially since that's also my maximum valuation. At this point, it's more reasonable to just go with John's offer.
