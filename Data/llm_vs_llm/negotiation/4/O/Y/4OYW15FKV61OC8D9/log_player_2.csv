"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is asking for $200, which is significantly higher than the $80 the product is worth to me. Since I can always buy the product from John for $80, there's no reason to accept an offer higher than that.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has lowered her price from $200 to $175, which shows some willingness to negotiate. However, this is still well above the $80 that the product is worth to me, and I can buy it from John for exactly $80. There's no reason for me to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has lowered her price again to $160, showing continued willingness to negotiate. However, this is still twice the price that I can get from John ($80). Since I know I can get the same product for $80, and that's the maximum value to me, there's no reason to accept this higher price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll continue to gradually increase my offer, but I need to keep it well below John's price of $80.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice is only making small reductions in her price now, dropping from $160 to $155. This is still nearly double what I can pay John ($80). Given that we're in round 7 of 10 and Alice's price is still far above my alternative, it makes sense to continue negotiating but to be clear about my constraints.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I need to be more direct about my position since we're approaching the end of our negotiation rounds.
