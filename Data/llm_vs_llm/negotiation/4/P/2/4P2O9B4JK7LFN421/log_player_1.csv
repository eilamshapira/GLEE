Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It allows for a potential win-win scenario for both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and leaves me with very little profit. It's better to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This counteroffer is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his proposed price. I believe this offer shows my willingness to negotiate but also demonstrates the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's latest offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'd like to earn. Selling to John guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation."
