I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's higher than what John is offering, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
```

I'm counter-offering with $11,250.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I believe this price is fair, and I'm hopeful Bob will accept."
