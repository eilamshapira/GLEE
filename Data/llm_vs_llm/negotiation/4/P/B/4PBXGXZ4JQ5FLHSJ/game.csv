"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $9500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8500.  This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and it still gives you a great deal on this valuable product. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $8500 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $7800? This way, we both get a fair deal.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $7800 is still too far off from what I need to get for this product.  Let's split the difference - $8150.  This is a fair price that shows I'm serious about making a deal with you.  Let me know what you think.",8150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8150 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. Let's meet in the middle at $8000. This is the highest I can go, and it's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,6,
