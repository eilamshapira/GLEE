# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this exclusive product for $8000. It’s a great deal, and I’d love to work with you on it. Let me know if you’re interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is offering the product at her own valuation. There's no benefit to buying from her at this price when John will sell it for the same amount.  I might be able to get a better deal from John."
