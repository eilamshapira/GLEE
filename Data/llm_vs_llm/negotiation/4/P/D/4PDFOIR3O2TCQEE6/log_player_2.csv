This is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price but gives her room to counter if she's genuinely interested in selling."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This is a tough one. Alice is down to her value for the product. However, we can still try to push for a slightly better price since we have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 9500

This is our final push. We're splitting the difference between our previous offer and her current one. It signals that we're serious but also willing to walk away if she doesn't budge."
