"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer is $200, which is more than the maximum value of $100 for me, and John is offering the same product for $100, I should buy from John.
