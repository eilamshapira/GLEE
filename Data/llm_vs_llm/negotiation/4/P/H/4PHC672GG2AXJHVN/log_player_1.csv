"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product to offer you today. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, I was hoping to get a better deal. Would you be willing to sell the product for $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll proceed with a counteroffer in the next round. While $10,000 is closer to my target, I believe there's still room for negotiation since Bob's initial response shows willingness to pay a substantial amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is a step in the right direction, considering the product's quality and market value, I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is already a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. However, I think there's still room for negotiation. Would you consider selling the product for $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $9,500. This is a good price that's well above my minimum threshold of $8,000, and Bob seems to have reached a reasonable middle ground. Continuing the negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether, and $9,500 represents a satisfactory outcome for both parties."
