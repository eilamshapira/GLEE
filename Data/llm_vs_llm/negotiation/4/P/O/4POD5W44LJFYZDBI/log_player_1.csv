Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $150. It's a great product and I think you'll find it very valuable. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering your product. I'm interested, but $150 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I would be willing to lower my price to $125. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 125}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for getting back to me. I understand that $150 might be a bit high. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a great value for the product. Would you consider this new offer?"", ""product_price"": 125}

My reasoning for this counteroffer is that by reducing the price from $150 to $125, I show willingness to negotiate while still aiming to achieve a higher profit than the guaranteed $100 from John. It's important to find a balance between making a profit and making the price attractive enough for Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $125 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $110. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob has made a counteroffer of $110, which is only $10 less than my previous offer of $125. Given that my fallback option is to sell the product to John for $100, accepting Bob's offer of $110 would yield me an additional $10 in profit. Therefore, it makes sense to accept Bob's offer at this price, as it is a reasonable compromise and ensures a successful sale with a profit."
