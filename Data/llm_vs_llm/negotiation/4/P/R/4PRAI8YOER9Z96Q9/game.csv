"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is well above my budget for this product. I've done some market research, and I can find similar products for much less. I'd be willing to offer $60 for it. This is a fair price considering market conditions.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $60 is significantly below the value of this product. I understand budget concerns, but I need to be realistic about the product's worth. Given the quality and current market value, I can come down to $210. This is already a considerable discount from my initial price. The product is worth significantly more than $60 based on its condition and features.",210.0,Alice,3,
