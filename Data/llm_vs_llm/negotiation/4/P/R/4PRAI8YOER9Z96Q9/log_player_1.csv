"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm selling for $250. This product is in excellent condition and provides great value. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is well above my budget for this product. I've done some market research, and I can find similar products for much less. I'd be willing to offer $60 for it. This is a fair price considering market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $60 is significantly below the value of this product. I understand budget concerns, but I need to be realistic about the product's worth. Given the quality and current market value, I can come down to $210. This is already a considerable discount from my initial price. The product is worth significantly more than $60 based on its condition and features."", ""product_price"": 210}"
