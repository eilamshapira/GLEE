"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm selling for $250. This product is in excellent condition and provides great value. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me think about this:
1. My maximum value for the product is $80
2. Alice's offer of $250 is way above my maximum value
3. John is offering the product at $80, which is my maximum acceptable price
4. However, I might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice

I'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate down since $250 is far too high.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but I'll be polite and explain my position.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is well above my budget for this product. I've done some market research, and I can find similar products for much less. I'd be willing to offer $60 for it. This is a fair price considering market conditions."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $60 is significantly below the value of this product. I understand budget concerns, but I need to be realistic about the product's worth. Given the quality and current market value, I can come down to $210. This is already a considerable discount from my initial price. The product is worth significantly more than $60 based on its condition and features. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $210. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $210
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Alice only reduced the price by $40 (from $250 to $210)
2. She's still asking for more than twice what I value the product at ($80)
3. Her response to my $60 offer suggests she's not willing to come down dramatically
4. I know I can get the product from John for $80

Since Alice is still far above my maximum value and doesn't seem willing to negotiate to a much lower price point, and I have a guaranteed option with John at $80, I'll end the negotiation and buy from John.
