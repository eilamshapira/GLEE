"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that Alice's offer is $12,000 and the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and John is willing to sell the same product for $10,000, Alice's offer doesn't make economic sense. I should either try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John.

Since John's price is already at my maximum value point ($10,000), and Alice's initial offer is above that, I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice that's below John's price to see if we can reach a better deal.

{""product_price"": $8,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has lowered her offer to $11,000, which is still above John's price of $10,000. Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and John is offering exactly $10,000, Alice's offer is still not economically beneficial for me.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $9,200}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $10,500, but this is still higher than John's price of $10,000. Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and John's offer is exactly at my maximum value point, I should not accept Alice's current offer.

I have two reasonable options: continue negotiating with Alice or buy from John. Since John's offer is guaranteed and already at my maximum value point, and we've already gone through 5 rounds of negotiation with Alice still offering above my maximum, the most sensible decision is:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
