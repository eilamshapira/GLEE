"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to consider this price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $80. I understand that $200 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $80. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. How about we meet in the middle at $150? I think this price reflects the product's value more accurately.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for your new proposal of $150. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd like to propose a compromise of $90. I believe this price is more in line with my budget, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $90. I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. While $90 is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. This price takes into account your budget concerns while also ensuring I receive a fair value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",110.0,Alice,5,
