Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a price that I think reflects its value."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually agreeable price. Since Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my initial offer of $200, I'll try to meet him halfway while still ensuring I get a good price for the product. My counteroffer will be $150."

I understand that $200 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $80. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. How about we meet in the middle at $150? I think this price reflects the product's value more accurately."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for your new proposal of $150. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd like to propose a compromise of $90. I believe this price is more in line with my budget, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since Bob has increased his offer from $80 to $90, it shows he's interested in the product and willing to pay more. However, $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to find a compromise that works for both of us. My next counteroffer will be $110, which is closer to Bob's offer but still reflects the product's value. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $90. I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. While $90 is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. This price takes into account your budget concerns while also ensuring I receive a fair value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 110}"
