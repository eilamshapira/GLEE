Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","I have to make a decision now.

Considering the options:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000:** This is far below my minimum price of $1,200,000.
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer:** This gives me a chance to potentially get a higher price from Bob.
*   **(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000:** This guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price.

Since I believe there is a chance to earn more than the minimum, I will counteroffer Bob.

I think it's time to secure a sale. I will sell to John.
