"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision that maximizes my benefit.

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me.
Alice is offering to sell it for $950,000, which exceeds its value to me.
John (Jhon in the options) is willing to sell the same product for $800,000.

Since Alice's offer ($950,000) is higher than both the product's value to me and John's offer ($800,000), the logical choice is to buy from John.
