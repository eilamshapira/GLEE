"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the premium quality of your product, I find $18000 to be significantly above my budget. I know this product is available elsewhere for much less. Given that, I would like to offer $8500 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. I'm open to further discussion if this doesn't meet your expectations.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you have budget constraints, but I'm afraid $8500 is significantly lower than the product's value. Considering your feedback, I'm willing to lower my initial price to $15000. This price takes into account the market value and the benefits that this premium product can bring to you. I believe it's a fair price that works for both parties. I'm open to further discussion if you have a different figure in mind.",15000.0,Alice,3,
