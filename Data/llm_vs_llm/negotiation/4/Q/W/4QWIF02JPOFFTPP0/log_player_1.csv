"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the premium quality of your product, I find $18000 to be significantly above my budget. I know this product is available elsewhere for much less. Given that, I would like to offer $8500 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. I'm open to further discussion if this doesn't meet your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, as $8,500 is significantly lower than my valuation and John's offer of $12,000. I will try to negotiate a better price from Bob to maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you have budget constraints, but I'm afraid $8,500 is significantly lower than the product's value. Considering your feedback, I'm willing to lower my initial price to $15,000. This price takes into account the market value and the benefits that this premium product can bring to you. I believe it's a fair price that works for both parties. I'm open to further discussion if you have a different figure in mind."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
