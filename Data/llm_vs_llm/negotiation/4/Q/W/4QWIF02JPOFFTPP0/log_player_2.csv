"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional quality and the value it can bring to you, I'm confident that it's worth $18000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have a different figure in mind. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $10,000 and also higher than John's price of $10,000. It would be logical to either negotiate with Alice for a better price or buy from John. Since we have the opportunity to negotiate, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more reasonable price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the premium quality of your product, I find $18,000 to be significantly above my budget. I know this product is available elsewhere for much less. Given that, I would like to offer $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. I'm open to further discussion if this doesn't meet your expectations."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you have budget constraints, but I'm afraid $8500 is significantly lower than the product's value. Considering your feedback, I'm willing to lower my initial price to $15000. This price takes into account the market value and the benefits that this premium product can bring to you. I believe it's a fair price that works for both parties. I'm open to further discussion if you have a different figure in mind. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's new offer of $15,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000), and Alice's price reduction was relatively small (from $18,000 to $15,000), it seems unlikely that we'll reach an agreement below $10,000. It's more practical to accept John's offer at $10,000 rather than continue negotiations that may not lead to a better outcome."
