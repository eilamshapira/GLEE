"Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1000000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market value. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1000000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $800000.

"Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $850000. I think this is a reasonable compromise given the circumstances. What do you say?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit above your offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'd like to sell the product to you for $875000. Let me know if this works for you.",875000.0,Alice,5,
