Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1000000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market value. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to counteroffer since $800,000 is the minimum value I have for the product, and I believe it might be worth more to Bob. Let's see if we can negotiate further. 

My counteroffer is: $900,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $850000. I think this is a reasonable compromise given the circumstances. What do you say?

I'd like to counteroffer again since $850,000 is closer to my target, but I still believe the product is worth more. I'll try to meet Bob in the middle.
