Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for it, which is still a fair price considering the potential benefits.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
