"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. I know it's worth a million to you, and frankly, it's worth at least that much to me as well.  However, I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Looking at the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000
2. John (alternative seller) is also offering the product for $1,000,000
3. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me

Since both sellers are offering the same price ($1,000,000), and this price equals my maximum valuation, I'm indifferent between them financially. There's no money to be saved by choosing one over the other.
