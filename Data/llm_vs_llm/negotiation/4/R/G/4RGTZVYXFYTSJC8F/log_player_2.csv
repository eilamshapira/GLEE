"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Based on the information provided, I'll evaluate the options:

1. Alice's offer is $1,200,000
2. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me (Bob)
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $800,000

Alice's offer ($1,200,000) exceeds both the value to me ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000). There's no reason to accept Alice's offer when I can buy the same product from John at a better price that matches my maximum valuation.
