"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,500,000 exceeds the maximum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to you, and John is willing to sell the same product for $1,000,000, the rational decision would be to buy from John.
