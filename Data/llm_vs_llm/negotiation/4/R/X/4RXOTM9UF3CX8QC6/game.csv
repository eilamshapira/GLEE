"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is significantly above my budget. I can find similar products in the market for much less. I would be willing to pay $6500 for the product. This is a fair offer considering market conditions.",6500.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, $6500 is below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $13000? This price reflects the value of the product and still offers you a good deal.",13000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your position, but I need to ensure the value of the product is recognized. Let's consider $12500. This is a fair price that aligns closely with market value and still provides you with a quality product at a reasonable cost.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for lowering the price, Alice. However, $12500 is still beyond what I can justify spending. The market has similar products available for much less. I can increase my offer to $7200. This is a significant improvement from my previous offer and represents the real value I see in this product.",7200.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7200 is still below our minimum threshold. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $12200? This price is very close to what another buyer is willing to pay, and it's a final offer from my side before considering other options.",12200.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. Given the value of the product and the offers on the table, I'm willing to lower the price to $12100. This is my final offer before I need to consider other buyers. Let me know if this works for you.",12100.0,Alice,5,
