Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is significantly above my budget. I can find similar products in the market for much less. I would be willing to pay $6500 for the product. This is a fair offer considering market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500

While I understand your budget constraints, $6,500 is below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $13,000?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your position, but I need to ensure the value of the product is recognized. Let's consider $12,500.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for lowering the price, Alice. However, $12500 is still beyond what I can justify spending. The market has similar products available for much less. I can increase my offer to $7200. This is a significant improvement from my previous offer and represents the real value I see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200.

Round 5
