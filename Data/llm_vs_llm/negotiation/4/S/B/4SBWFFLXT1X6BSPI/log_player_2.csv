"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $200. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer of $200 is higher than both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150), it wouldn't make sense to accept it. While I could immediately buy from John, it might be worth trying to negotiate with Alice first to potentially get an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than John's price but still reasonable enough to negotiate.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $200 is a bit too high for me. I can find similar products for less elsewhere. Would you consider selling it for $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $160? I believe this is a fair price for the quality of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer of $160 is still higher than both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150), it's still not a good deal. However, Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing the price significantly. I'll reject and try one more counter-offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I can actually get this product from another seller for $150. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. Would you consider $135?"", ""product_price"": 135}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position. How about we close the deal at $145? I believe this is a competitive price for what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has offered $145, which is lower than both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150). This is a good deal as it saves me $5 compared to buying from John. I should accept this offer.
