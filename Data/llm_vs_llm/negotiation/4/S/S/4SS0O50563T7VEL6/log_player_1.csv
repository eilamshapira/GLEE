Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is lower than my minimum acceptable price and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price from him.

My counteroffer to Bob will be $1,100,000. 

However, the question only asks for the decision, so: 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $950,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and also lower than what I can get from John, but getting closer, I will reject Bob's offer again and try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price from him.

My next decision is to reject Bob's offer.
