It's not worth paying $1,200,000 when I can get it for $1,000,000 from John.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first."

I'm starting with a low offer, hoping to get Alice to come down significantly.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is still a good deal for her, but leaves me some room to negotiate."

Alice is coming down, but not enough.  I'll try another counteroffer, and see if we can meet in the middle."

I'm increasing my offer by $50,000,  showing Alice I'm serious about buying but still trying to get a better price than $1,100,000."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Alice is finally close to my desired price. While I could try to get a lower price, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price. $1,050,000 is still a good deal for me, and I don't want to waste any more time."
