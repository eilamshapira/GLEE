"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Let me start with a high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get well above my minimum price of $10,000.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","I will reject Bob's offer of $8,000 since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and also below John's guaranteed offer. However, I'll continue negotiating with Bob since there's potential to get a better price than John's $10,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still keep it well above my minimum to continue the negotiation.

{""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer equals John's offer of $10,000, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation with Bob showing limited movement upward, there's no clear advantage to continuing negotiations with Bob versus taking John's guaranteed offer. To avoid the risk of losing both opportunities, I'll accept Bob's current offer.
