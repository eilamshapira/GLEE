"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. If you're interested, please consider my offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Based on the information provided:

1. Alice is offering the product for $20,000
2. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $8,000

Since Alice's offer ($20,000) is significantly higher than both the product's worth to me and John's price, the logical choice is to buy from John.
