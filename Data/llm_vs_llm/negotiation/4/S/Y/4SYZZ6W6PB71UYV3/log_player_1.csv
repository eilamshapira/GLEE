Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum is $150. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}

I'm offering $175, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This should demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a reasonable price."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, but I'm running out of time. I've already made several concessions and am not confident that Bob will meet my minimum.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150 to ensure I get at least my minimum price."
