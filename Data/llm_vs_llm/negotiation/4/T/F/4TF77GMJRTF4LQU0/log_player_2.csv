"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given the information:
- The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me (Bob)
- Alice's offer is $1,300,000, which exceeds my maximum value
- John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000, which matches my maximum value

Alice's offer is $300,000 more than my maximum valuation, so it doesn't make sense to accept it. I could make a counteroffer, but since John's price exactly matches my maximum valuation, and there's no guarantee Alice will go below $1,000,000 (since the product is worth $1,200,000 to her), the most rational decision is to buy from John.
