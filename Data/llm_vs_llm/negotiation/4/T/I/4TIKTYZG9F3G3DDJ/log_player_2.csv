"Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer is $800,000, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and buying from John would also cost me $800,000, I don't see any benefit in rejecting Alice's offer or buying from John at this point.
