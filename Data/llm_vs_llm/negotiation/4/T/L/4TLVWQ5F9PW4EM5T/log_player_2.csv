"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","The price Alice is offering ($1,200,000) exceeds the maximum value the product is worth to me ($800,000) and also exceeds John's fixed price ($800,000). It doesn't make economic sense to accept Alice's offer since I can get the same product from John at a lower price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,000,000 is still above the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me, and it's also higher than John's fixed price of $800,000. There's no reason for me to accept this offer when I can get the product from John for less.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly, but still keep it below John's price to maintain my negotiating advantage.

{""product_price"": $650,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above John's price of $800,000. Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and I have the option to buy it from John at exactly $800,000, Alice's offer doesn't make economic sense for me to accept.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make one more reasonable offer, still giving Alice a chance to beat John's price while providing me savings.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer of $850,000 is still above John's price of $800,000. Since I can get the exact same product from John for $800,000, and the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, it wouldn't be rational to accept Alice's current offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make one final counteroffer to Alice. Given the progression of our negotiation, I'll offer a price that's very close to John's price but still gives me a small advantage.
