"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The offer from Alice is $11,000, which is higher than the $8,000 the product is worth to me. It's also higher than John's offer of $8,000. Since I can buy the product from John for exactly what it's worth to me, there's no reason to accept Alice's higher offer or to continue negotiating.
