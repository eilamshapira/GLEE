"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1750000 is way above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I actually have another seller offering it for that price. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can offer $850000 for the product. This would still give you a reasonable profit while being within my budget constraints.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $850000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1250000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
