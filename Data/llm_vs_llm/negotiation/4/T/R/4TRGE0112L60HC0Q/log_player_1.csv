"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1750000 is way above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I actually have another seller offering it for that price. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can offer $850000 for the product. This would still give you a reasonable profit while being within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
