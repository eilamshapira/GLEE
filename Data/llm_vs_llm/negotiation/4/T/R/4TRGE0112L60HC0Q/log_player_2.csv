"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I would reject this offer as it's higher than my maximum value ($1,000,000) and even higher than John's fixed price ($1,000,000). Since Alice's initial offer is $1,750,000, which is significantly above both my maximum value and the alternative option, it makes sense to reject and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still gives her some room for negotiation above John's price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is way above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and I actually have another seller offering it for that price. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can offer $850,000 for the product. This would still give you a reasonable profit while being within my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $850000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1250000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), there's no reason to accept this offer. At this point, since John's price is better than Alice's current offer and we have limited rounds for negotiation, it would be most rational to buy from John.
