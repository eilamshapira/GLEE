"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, the price is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $800000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1200000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a middle ground. I can come down to $1500000, which is still a fair price considering the product's quality and market potential. How does that sound?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I understand the product's value, $1500000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1000000. This offer represents a fair compromise, in my opinion.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $1000000. We're making progress, but I need to be transparent with you - I have John's firm offer of $1200000 on the table. Since I'd prefer to do business with you, I'm willing to match John's price at $1200000. This is the absolute minimum I can accept, as anything less would mean I'm losing money by choosing you over John. This is a fair price that reflects the true market value of the product. Can we close the deal at this price?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
