Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, the price is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $800000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,200,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a middle ground. I can come down to $1,500,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's quality and market potential. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I understand the product's value, $1500000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1000000. This offer represents a fair compromise, in my opinion.  Let me know your thoughts.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $1,000,000. We're making progress, but I need to be transparent with you - I have John's firm offer of $1,200,000 on the table. Since I'd prefer to do business with you, I'm willing to match John's price at $1,200,000. This is the absolute minimum I can accept, as anything less would mean I'm losing money by choosing you over John. This is a fair price that reflects the true market value of the product. Can we close the deal at this price?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
