"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I'd like to offer you today. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $1800000. This is an excellent investment opportunity with significant potential returns. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, the price is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1200000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a middle ground. I can come down to $1500000, which is still a fair price considering the product's quality and market potential. How does that sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I understand the product's value, $1,500,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This offer represents a fair compromise, in my opinion.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $1000000. We're making progress, but I need to be transparent with you - I have John's firm offer of $1200000 on the table. Since I'd prefer to do business with you, I'm willing to match John's price at $1200000. This is the absolute minimum I can accept, as anything less would mean I'm losing money by choosing you over John. This is a fair price that reflects the true market value of the product. Can we close the deal at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It seems we've reached the limit of Alice's flexibility. She's matched John's offer, and going any lower seems unlikely. Accepting this offer prevents potentially missing out on the product altogether."
