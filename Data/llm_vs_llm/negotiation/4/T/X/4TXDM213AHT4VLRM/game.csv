"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $15000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Would you consider $12000 for the product?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is unfortunately too low for me. This product is unique and has a significant value, and I believe $18000 is a fair price that reflects that. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than that. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
