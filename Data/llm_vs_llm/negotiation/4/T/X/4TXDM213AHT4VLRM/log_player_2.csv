"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $25000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Explanation: Alice's offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $15,000 and also higher than John's guaranteed price of $15,000. It would not be rational to accept this offer. Since John is offering the product at my maximum acceptable price, I could go with that option, but it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first to potentially get an even better deal. Therefore, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $15,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Would you consider $12,000 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is unfortunately too low for me. This product is unique and has a significant value, and I believe $18000 is a fair price that reflects that. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Explanation: Alice's new offer of $18,000 is still above both my maximum value ($15,000) and John's guaranteed price ($15,000). While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing the price significantly from $25,000 to $18,000, it's still not a better deal than what John is offering. Since there's no guarantee that Alice will reduce the price below $15,000 in future negotiations, the most rational decision is to take John's guaranteed offer of $15,000."
