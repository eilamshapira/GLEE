"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $2000000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1500000 to me, which is what another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1250000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to the other seller.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, I can't go as low as $1250000. How about we meet halfway? I can offer you the product for $1750000. Let me know if this works for you!",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on your price. Unfortunately, $1750000 is still above what makes financial sense for me. I have a confirmed offer from another seller for $1500000, which is truly the maximum I can pay for this product based on its value to me. To make it worth switching our deal, I'd need a better price than that. I can offer you $1400000, which would save me some money while still giving you a good deal. This is the best I can do, otherwise I'll need to go with the other offer.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your continued interest and your latest offer. I understand your position, but I still value the product highly. How about we settle at $1600000? This would still be below my minimum acceptable price, but it brings us closer. Let me know your thoughts!",1600000.0,Alice,5,
