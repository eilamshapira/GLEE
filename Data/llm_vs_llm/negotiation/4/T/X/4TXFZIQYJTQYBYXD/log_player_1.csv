Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $2000000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $1500000 to me, which is what another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1250000 for the product. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to the other seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, I can't go as low as $1,250,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on your price. Unfortunately, $1750000 is still above what makes financial sense for me. I have a confirmed offer from another seller for $1500000, which is truly the maximum I can pay for this product based on its value to me. To make it worth switching our deal, I'd need a better price than that. I can offer you $1400000, which would save me some money while still giving you a good deal. This is the best I can do, otherwise I'll need to go with the other offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your continued interest and your latest offer. I understand your position, but I still value the product highly. How about we settle at $1,600,000? This would still be below my minimum acceptable price, but it brings us closer. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
