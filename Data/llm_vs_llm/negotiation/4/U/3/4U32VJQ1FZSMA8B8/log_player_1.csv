Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob.

{""product_price"": $1,350,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","I'll analyze this situation:

- The product is worth at least $800,000 to me
- Bob's current offer is $1,000,000
- I can sell to John for $800,000 (my minimum value)
- The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is better than my minimum ($800,000), but I believe there's room for negotiation since it's still well below the product's value to Bob. I'll reject and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer to Bob that's more reasonable but still allows me to capture good value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","I'll analyze the situation again:

- Bob has increased his offer from $1,000,000 to $1,100,000
- This is $300,000 more than John's fixed offer of $800,000
- The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob
- We seem to be making progress in the negotiation

Bob's new offer of $1,100,000 is a substantial improvement. While I could push for more, there's also risk in continuing to negotiate if Bob becomes frustrated. Since this offer is already significantly better than my minimum acceptable value, I'll accept it.
