"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still below my maximum budget of $1,500,000, but I believe I can get a better deal, I will choose to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Considering Alice's worth of $800,000, I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle, but closer to Alice's worth.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,200,000 is more reasonable, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since Alice rejected my previous counteroffer of $1,000,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her new offer and my previous counteroffer.

However, before making another counteroffer, I'll consider my options. Accepting Alice's offer of $1,200,000 would save me $300,000 compared to buying from John. Rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer risks her not accepting it and potentially losing the deal. Buying from John is still an option, but it's my least preferred choice.

For now, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer, trying to get closer to my target price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a new counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one, trying to find a mutually acceptable price. Considering Alice's new offer of $1,200,000, I'll aim to split the difference between my previous counteroffer of $1,000,000 and Alice's new offer.
