"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! Based on its value, I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Given Bob's offer of $100, which is below my minimum acceptable price of $120, I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $130."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","This is getting tricky. Bob's still offering below my minimum of $120. I could reject and counter again, but the risk of him going lower or rejecting altogether is increasing. I'm also getting closer to the end of the rounds, which means less time to negotiate.

Since I value the product at $120, I think I'll stop negotiating with Bob and sell the product to John.
