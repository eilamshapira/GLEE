"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $160 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
