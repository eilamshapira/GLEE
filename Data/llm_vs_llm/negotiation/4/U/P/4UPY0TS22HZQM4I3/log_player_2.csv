"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer ($150) is higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100), it wouldn't make sense to accept it. Since John is offering the product at $100, which is my maximum value, I could buy from him. However, I might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice, so I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's $150 offer, but still reasonable enough to potentially be accepted. Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, I'll offer a price that would still give her some profit while being better than John's price for me.

{""product_price"": 85}

This offer would give Alice a $15 profit while saving me $15 compared to John's price. If she rejects this, I can still negotiate up or ultimately go to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has lowered her price from $150 to $130, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $130 is still above both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). There's no reason to accept this offer when I can get it cheaper from John. I'll reject and try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $150 to $130, showing some flexibility, I'll increase my previous offer slightly but still keep it below John's price to try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.

{""product_price"": 90}

This offer would give Alice a $10 profit while still saving me $10 compared to John's price. If she rejects this again, I might consider going to John since we're already in round 4 and need to close the deal within 10 rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has lowered her price again to $115, but it's still higher than John's price of $100. Since I can get the same product from John for $100, and Alice's offer is still above that, there's no reason to accept this offer. However, we're halfway through our negotiation rounds, and Alice seems to be gradually lowering her price. I'll reject and make one more attempt at a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has been gradually lowering her price ($150 -> $130 -> $115), I'll make one more reasonable counteroffer. I'll increase my previous offer slightly but keep it below John's price.

{""product_price"": 95}

This would give Alice a $5 profit while saving me $5 compared to John's price. If she rejects this offer, I should seriously consider taking John's offer since we're now in round 6 and time is becoming a factor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's offer of $105 is still above John's price of $100. While Alice has shown significant movement in price ($150 -> $130 -> $115 -> $105), there's no reason for me to pay $105 when I can get the same product from John for $100. Given that we're now in round 7 of 10, and Alice still hasn't matched or beaten John's price, I think it's time to end the negotiation and go with John's offer.
