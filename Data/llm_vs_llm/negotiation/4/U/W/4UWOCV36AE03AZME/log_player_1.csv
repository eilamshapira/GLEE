Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price of $15,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but I believe it's a fair starting point.  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $5,000 is far too low.  It's significantly less than my minimum value of $12,000. I'm not going to accept that. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $10,000. This is still a good margin above my minimum value, but it's a sign of good faith that I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see if Bob is more agreeable to this price."
