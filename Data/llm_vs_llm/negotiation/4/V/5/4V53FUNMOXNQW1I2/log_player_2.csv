(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer matches our maximum budget, there's no harm in seeing if we can get a better price. We have plenty of rounds to negotiate and the option to buy from John is always there as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and our maximum budget. This leaves room for negotiation while still potentially securing a good deal."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice reducing her price indicates a willingness to negotiate.  We're still significantly below our maximum budget, so it's worth countering again to see if we can get closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

**Reasoning:**  We're splitting the difference between our last offer and her current offer.  This shows we're willing to move but also want a price closer to our initial target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down another $10, and we are getting close to a point where further haggling might be unproductive.  A $100 price is a solid savings of $20 from our maximum budget and a reasonable compromise."
