"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be beneficial for you. Given its unique features and market value, I'm offering it at $1,800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and potential value."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is too high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $1200000.  This is my best and final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

The reasoning is simple: Bob explicitly stated $1,200,000 is his best and final offer, which is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Since John is willing to pay $1,500,000, and Bob can't go higher than $1,200,000, it makes the most sense to sell to John rather than continue negotiations that won't lead to a better outcome."
