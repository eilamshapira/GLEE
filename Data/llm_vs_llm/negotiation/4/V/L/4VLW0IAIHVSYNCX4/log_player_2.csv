"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this excellent product. I'm asking for $25000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's start with a lower offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate.

# Bob's counteroffer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $4,000 on this product. Would you be willing to accept this amount?"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $4000 is far too low. This product is worth significantly more. I could consider $20000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's continue negotiating and try to find a middle ground.

# Bob's counteroffer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $20,000 is still too high for me. Can we meet in the middle at $5,000?"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $20,000 is still too high for me. Can we meet in the middle at $5,000?"", ""product_price"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need a more realistic offer from you.  How about $18000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll increase my offer a bit to see if we can reach an agreement, but I'll still keep it much lower than Alice's current ask.

# Bob's counteroffer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $18,000 is still out of my budget. I can go up to $6,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $18,000 is still out of my budget. I can go up to $6,000."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to drop to $16000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Given that Alice's current offer is still significantly higher than my maximum budget and John's price, it makes more sense for me to buy the product from John for $8,000."
