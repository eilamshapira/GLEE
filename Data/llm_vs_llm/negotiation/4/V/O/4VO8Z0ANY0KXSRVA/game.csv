"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $14000 is a bit high for me. Given the market conditions and similar products available, I believe $11500 would be a more reasonable price. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more aligned with my budget.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, after considering your previous offer, I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $12500? This price takes into account both our interests, and I believe it's a fair middle ground for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. I can move up to $11900. This gives you a healthy profit margin while being more in line with my budget constraints.",11900.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I've reconsidered and I'm willing to make another adjustment to close the deal. How about we settle for $12000? This price should be more aligned with your budget while still being fair to me as the seller.",12000.0,Alice,5,
