"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14000. It's a great value and I hope you find this price acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $15,000
2. Alice's offer is $14,000
3. The product is worth $10,000 to Alice
4. I still have 9 more rounds to negotiate
5. John's offer of $15,000 is my backup option

Since Alice's initial offer is $14,000 and I know the product is worth $10,000 to her, there's significant room for negotiation. With 9 rounds remaining, I can try to get a better price. $14,000 is too close to my maximum value, and I can likely get a better deal through negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that the product is worth $10,000 to Alice and her initial offer was $14,000, I'll start with a relatively low but reasonable counteroffer to leave room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $14,000 is a bit high for me. Given the market conditions and similar products available, I believe $11,500 would be a more reasonable price. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more aligned with my budget."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after considering your previous offer, I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $12500? This price takes into account both our interests, and I believe it's a fair middle ground for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice has reduced her price significantly from $14,000 to $12,500
2. This is a $1,500 reduction from her initial offer
3. The product costs Alice $10,000
4. We still have 7 more rounds for negotiation
5. The current offer ($12,500) represents a $2,500 margin for Alice

While Alice has made a substantial move in my direction, there's still room for negotiation. The current price of $12,500 gives Alice a 25% profit margin. Since we have several rounds left and I know her cost basis, I believe we can reach a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $1,500 from her initial offer, I'll also show flexibility by moving up from my initial counteroffer, but still try to get a better deal.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. I can move up to $11,900. This gives you a healthy profit margin while being more in line with my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 11900}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I've reconsidered and I'm willing to make another adjustment to close the deal. How about we settle for $12000? This price should be more aligned with your budget while still being fair to me as the seller. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze the new situation:

1. Alice has now reduced her price to $12,000, coming down another $500
2. This is a total reduction of $2,000 from her initial offer
3. The current price gives Alice a $2,000 profit margin (20% over her cost)
4. We're now in round 5, with 5 rounds remaining
5. The price is 20% below my maximum value ($15,000)

Alice has shown significant flexibility by reducing the price again. At $12,000, this is a reasonable deal that:
- Gives Alice a fair profit
- Saves me $3,000 compared to John's offer
- Is significantly below my maximum value
- Risks further negotiation potentially souring the deal

Given this analysis, I think it's wise to accept this offer now.
