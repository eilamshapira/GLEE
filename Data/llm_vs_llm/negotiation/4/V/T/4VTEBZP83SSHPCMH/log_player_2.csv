"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd really like. I'm offering it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","The price Alice is offering ($180) is significantly higher than what the product is worth to me (no more than $120). Additionally, I know John is selling the same product for $120, which is exactly the maximum value I'd place on this product.

Given these facts, it would be most economical for me to buy from John rather than accept Alice's inflated offer or go through a potentially lengthy negotiation process that might not reach a price lower than $120.
