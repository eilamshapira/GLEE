"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $18000 for it. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18000 is quite steep for me. I can get the same product from another seller for $10000. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for your product if you're interested.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9000 is a bit too low for me.  While I understand you can find similar products for $10000, mine is unique in several ways [briefly mention any unique features or benefits of your product].  I'm willing to come down to $14000.  This gives us both room to make a deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
