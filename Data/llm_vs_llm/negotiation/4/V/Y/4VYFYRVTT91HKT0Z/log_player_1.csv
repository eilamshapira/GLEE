"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18000 is quite steep for me. I can get the same product from another seller for $10000. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for your product if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  While I understand you can find similar products for $10,000, mine is unique in several ways [briefly mention any unique features or benefits of your product].  I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This gives us both room to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
