Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9000 is a bit too low for me.  While I understand you can find similar products for $10000, mine is unique in several ways [briefly mention any unique features or benefits of your product].  I'm willing to come down to $14000.  This gives us both room to make a deal.
