"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's initial offer of $140 is close to my maximum value ($150) and not significantly better than John's price ($150), I should reject and try to negotiate for a better deal. Given that the product is worth $80 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.

Round 2

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since we're now in round 6 out of 10, and Alice has shown willingness to reduce price gradually, I'll make a more substantial increase from my last offer to try to meet closer to the middle.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has come down to $120, which is a good price compared to John's $150. We're in round 7 of 10, and the price movement is getting smaller ($125 → $120). While there might be a bit more room for negotiation, the risk of losing this deal and having to pay $150 to John is not worth the potential small savings. I'll accept this offer.
