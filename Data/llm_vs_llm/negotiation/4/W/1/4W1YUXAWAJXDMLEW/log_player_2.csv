"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer of $13,000 is higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($10,000), it doesn't make sense for me to accept this offer. Additionally, buying from John for $10,000 is an option, but I'd like to try to negotiate with Alice first to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm willing to pay up to $10,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is somewhat close to that, but leaves room for further negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $12,500 is still higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($10,000). While it's a slight improvement from her initial offer of $13,000, it's still not within my budget.

At this point, I have to consider whether it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice or just buying the product from John for $10,000. Since Alice's offer is still $2,500 higher than what I'm willing to pay, I think it's unlikely that we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.

Therefore, I've decided to stop negotiating with Alice and buy the product from John instead.
