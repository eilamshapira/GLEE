"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $20000 represents the high-end of its value, I understand your budget constraints.  Could you consider meeting me halfway at $16000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $13000? I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $14000. How about $14500? I think this price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget.",14500.0,Alice,5,
