Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am only willing to pay $10000 for it. Would you consider this as a fair price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. My counteroffer will be $18,000.

Bob's offer:

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, but closer to the price I can sell to John. My counteroffer will be $15,000, trying to meet Bob halfway.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.

Since Bob's final counteroffer of $12,500 is higher than the price I can sell to John for ($12,000), I'm willing to accept this offer. It's a reasonable price, and I'm glad we could reach an agreement.
