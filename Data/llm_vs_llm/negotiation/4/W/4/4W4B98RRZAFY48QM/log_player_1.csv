"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.

{""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","The offer of $110 is too low considering Bob values the product at $150. Since we're only in round 2 and have plenty of rounds left for negotiation, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial $140, but still aim for a good profit by suggesting a price that splits the difference more favorably for me.

{""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","$125 is a reasonable offer - it's significantly above my minimum threshold of $100 and gives Bob some value as well since the product is worth $150 to him. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Bob walking away or getting frustrated, and this price gives me a good profit. I'll accept this offer.
