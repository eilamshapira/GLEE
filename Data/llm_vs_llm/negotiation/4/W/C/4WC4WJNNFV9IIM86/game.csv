"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $200, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I think $200 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $100 considering my budget and the market price.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $200 might be out of your budget, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $175, which is a more reasonable price considering its value.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $175 is still a bit high for me. I can increase my offer to $120. Let's find some middle ground.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for increasing your offer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. However, $120 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. Considering you've come up from $100 to $120, I'm willing to come down a bit more from my previous offer. I can sell the product to you for $160, which is a very reasonable price given its quality and value.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $160 is still not quite where I'd like it to be. I'm willing to increase my offer to $135. Let's keep working towards a deal that benefits both of us.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your increased offer, Bob. I see we're getting closer, but $135 is still a bit shy of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make a small concession from my previous offer. I can sell the product to you for $155, which is a very competitive price considering its value and the fact that I have another buyer interested at $150. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",155.0,Alice,7,
