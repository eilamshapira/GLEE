"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $200, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I think $200 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $100 considering my budget and the market price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $100 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob or sell it to John for $150 if negotiations don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $200 might be out of your budget, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $175, which is a more reasonable price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 175}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $175 is still a bit high for me. I can increase my offer to $120. Let's find some middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Since Bob is willing to increase his offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. $120 is still too low, but I'm getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with. I'll try to meet him closer to the middle, but still above $150, which is my minimum acceptable price and also the price John is willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for increasing your offer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. However, $120 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. Considering you've come up from $100 to $120, I'm willing to come down a bit more from my previous offer. I can sell the product to you for $160, which is a very reasonable price given its quality and value."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $160 is still not quite where I'd like it to be. I'm willing to increase my offer to $135. Let's keep working towards a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Bob is getting closer to my target price, but $135 is still below what I'm willing to accept. Since I have the option to sell to John for $150, I'll try to get Bob to meet or exceed that price. I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly below my previous one, to show I'm still willing to negotiate, but also to encourage Bob to increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your increased offer, Bob. I see we're getting closer, but $135 is still a bit shy of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make a small concession from my previous offer. I can sell the product to you for $155, which is a very competitive price considering its value and the fact that I have another buyer interested at $150. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 155}"
