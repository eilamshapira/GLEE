Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $200 might be out of your budget, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $175, which is a more reasonable price considering its value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for increasing your offer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. However, $120 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. Considering you've come up from $100 to $120, I'm willing to come down a bit more from my previous offer. I can sell the product to you for $160, which is a very reasonable price given its quality and value.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your increased offer, Bob. I see we're getting closer, but $135 is still a bit shy of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make a small concession from my previous offer. I can sell the product to you for $155, which is a very competitive price considering its value and the fact that I have another buyer interested at $150. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.
