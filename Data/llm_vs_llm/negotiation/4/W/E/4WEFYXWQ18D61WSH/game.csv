"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $1000000 is lower than I can accept. The product offers significant value to you, worth $1500000 to be exact. I'm willing to come down slightly, and offer it to you for $1400000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think $1400000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our previous offers. How about we settle on $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
