"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a high initial offer allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a higher final price. Even if Bob rejects this offer, it sets a reference point for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly below both my valuation and his own stated valuation of $8,000. Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. It's worth continuing the negotiation to explore possibilities for a mutually agreeable price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 10000}

**Reasoning:**  Since Bob offered significantly lower than his perceived value, I will hold firm at my minimum acceptable price. This conveys the seriousness of my valuation and the fact that I have another buyer available."
