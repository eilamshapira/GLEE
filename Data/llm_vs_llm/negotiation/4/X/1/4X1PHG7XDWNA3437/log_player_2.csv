"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative offer ($8,000). It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer as I would lose money. Since we have 10 rounds to negotiate, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to get a better price from Alice. If the negotiations don't progress favorably, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6000}

Rationale: I'll start with a relatively low offer of $6,000 for the following reasons:
1. It's below my maximum value of $8,000, giving me room to negotiate upward if needed
2. It's below Alice's cost of $10,000, which will likely lead to a rejection, but it establishes a starting point for negotiations
3. In negotiation, it's common to start lower than your target price to allow room for compromise
4. If Alice counter-offers, we can potentially meet somewhere in the middle
5. I always have John's $8,000 offer as a backup if negotiations with Alice don't work out"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Rationale: I'll choose to buy from John for $8,000 because:
1. Alice's new offer of $10,000 is still above my maximum value of $8,000
2. While Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $12,000, she's now at her cost price ($10,000), suggesting she's unlikely to go much lower
3. John's offer of $8,000 is exactly at my maximum value
4. While we could continue negotiating with Alice, there's no guarantee she'll go below $10,000, and we might waste more rounds
5. Taking John's offer now ensures I get the product at my maximum acceptable price without further negotiation risk"
