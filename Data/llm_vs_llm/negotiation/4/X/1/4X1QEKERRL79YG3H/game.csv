"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12000 is significantly above my budget. I can get a similar product elsewhere for $8000, but I'm interested in working with you. I'd like to offer $6000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12000 may be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $6000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'd like to offer the product for $9000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.",9000.0,Alice,3,
