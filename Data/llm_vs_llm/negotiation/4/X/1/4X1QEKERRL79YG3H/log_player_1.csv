"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12000 is significantly above my budget. I can get a similar product elsewhere for $8000, but I'm interested in working with you. I'd like to offer $6000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $6,000 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'd like to proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 may be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $6,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'd like to offer the product for $9,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
