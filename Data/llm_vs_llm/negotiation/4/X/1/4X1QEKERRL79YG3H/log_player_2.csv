"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000, and also higher than John's guaranteed price of $8,000. It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations don't progress favorably, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12,000 is significantly above my budget. I can get a similar product elsewhere for $8,000, but I'm interested in working with you. I'd like to offer $6,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12000 may be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $6000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'd like to offer the product for $9000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John instead. Alice's new offer of $9,000 is still above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). Since Alice's counteroffer is still higher than John's guaranteed price, and given that we've already gone through three rounds without reaching a price below $8,000, it makes more economic sense to take John's offer rather than continue negotiations that might not reach a better price."
