"Alice's offer: The product price will be $199. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $199
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer of $199 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100), it would not be rational to accept her offer. John's price is equal to my maximum value, and it's much better than Alice's offer.
