"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair price.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it,  as that's what I'm comfortable with. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth more than $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so let's try $105. This is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I'm placing on the product. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price to $95. I'm still hoping we can meet at a price that better reflects the product's value. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to come down a bit more. Let's try $100. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
