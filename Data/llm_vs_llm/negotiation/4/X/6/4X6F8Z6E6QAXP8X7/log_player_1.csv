"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair price."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it,  as that's what I'm comfortable with. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $90 is still a bit lower than I'd like, and I have the option to sell to John for $80 if negotiations don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth more than $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so let's try $105. This is a more reasonable price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I'm placing on the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Although Bob is getting closer to my target price, $95 is still a bit lower than I'm aiming for, and I have the safety net of selling to John for $80. I'll try to meet Bob closer to the middle of our last two offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price to $95. I'm still hoping we can meet at a price that better reflects the product's value. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to come down a bit more. Let's try $100. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}"
