"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to be flexible with the price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. It's a great deal considering the product's value, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit high for me. Could we meet in the middle at $95? I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise further, but I'd like to propose a price of $100. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value and my costs. I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
