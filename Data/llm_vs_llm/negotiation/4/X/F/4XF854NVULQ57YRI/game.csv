"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $200 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $150 to me, which is what another seller is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. I'm willing to offer $120 for the product, which would save me some money while still providing you with a sale. Let me know if this works for you.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from on price. How about we meet in the middle at $160? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. That's certainly more reasonable, but I still have to consider that John is offering the same product for $150. Since that's the market price I'm aware of, I can offer you $140. This would save me $10 compared to John's price, and you'd still make a sale. Would that work for you?",140.0,Bob,4,
