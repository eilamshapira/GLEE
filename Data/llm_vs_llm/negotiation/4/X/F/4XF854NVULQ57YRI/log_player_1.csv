Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $200 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $150 to me, which is what another seller is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. I'm willing to offer $120 for the product, which would save me some money while still providing you with a sale. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. That's certainly more reasonable, but I still have to consider that John is offering the same product for $150. Since that's the market price I'm aware of, I can offer you $140. This would save me $10 compared to John's price, and you'd still make a sale. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
