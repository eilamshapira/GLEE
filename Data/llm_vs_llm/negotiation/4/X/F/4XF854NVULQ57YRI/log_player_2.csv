"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product at a competitive price. I believe you'll find it valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer compared to my alternatives.

Alice is offering the product at $200, which is $50 more than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($150). The product is only worth $150 to me, so accepting this offer would mean I'm paying more than the value I'd receive.

I already know I can buy the exact same product from John for $150, which matches my maximum valuation. However, I should try to negotiate with Alice first to see if I can get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $200 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $150 to me, which is what another seller is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. I'm willing to offer $120 for the product, which would save me some money while still providing you with a sale. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from on price. How about we meet in the middle at $160? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has countered with $160, which is still above the $150 maximum value the product has to me. While she's moved down from her initial $200 offer, I can still get the exact same product from John for $150.

Since Alice's offer exceeds my maximum valuation and is more expensive than my alternative option, it doesn't make financial sense to accept it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. That's certainly more reasonable, but I still have to consider that John is offering the same product for $150. Since that's the market price I'm aware of, I can offer you $140. This would save me $10 compared to John's price, and you'd still make a sale. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
