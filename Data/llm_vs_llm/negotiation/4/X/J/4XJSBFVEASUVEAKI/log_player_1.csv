Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think this through:

1. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $1,200,000
3. Since Bob and I both value the product at $1,200,000, I could try to get slightly more from Bob
4. If Bob rejects, I'm not worse off as I can still sell to John

I'll offer the product to Bob for a slightly higher price to try to maximize my profit.
