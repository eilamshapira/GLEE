"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering me the product for $1,100,000, but it's worth no more than $800,000 to me. Jhon is willing to sell it for $800,000, which matches my maximum valuation. Alice's current offer is significantly higher than my valuation and Jhon's price.

Since I want to save as much money as possible, and Alice's initial offer is $300,000 above my maximum valuation, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still gives her some room to negotiate.
