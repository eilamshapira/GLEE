"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I must point out that I can get the same product from another seller for $15000. I value our potential business relationship and would like to work with you, so I'm willing to offer $13500 for the product. This would give us both room for negotiation while still being a fair price considering the market alternatives.",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer and for sharing the market information. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, considering the product's value and the fact that I have another buyer willing to pay $15000, I'm willing to make a concession but not to the extent of your offer. I'd like to propose a price of $16500, which is still competitive and takes into account our potential business relationship.",16500.0,Alice,3,
