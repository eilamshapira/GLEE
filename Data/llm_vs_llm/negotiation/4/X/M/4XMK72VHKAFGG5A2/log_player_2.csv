"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be a great fit for you. After careful consideration, I've set a competitive price for the product. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Explanation (not part of response):
The offer of $17,500 is higher than both:
1. The maximum value I'm willing to pay ($15,000)
2. John's alternative offer ($15,000)

It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. If negotiations with Alice fail, I can always buy from John at $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I must point out that I can get the same product from another seller for $15,000. I value our potential business relationship and would like to work with you, so I'm willing to offer $13,500 for the product. This would give us both room for negotiation while still being a fair price considering the market alternatives."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer and for sharing the market information. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, considering the product's value and the fact that I have another buyer willing to pay $15000, I'm willing to make a concession but not to the extent of your offer. I'd like to propose a price of $16500, which is still competitive and takes into account our potential business relationship. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Explanation (not part of response):
Since:
1. Alice's new offer ($16,500) is still above my maximum value ($15,000)
2. Alice has revealed she has another buyer at $15,000
3. John is offering the product at $15,000

It makes most sense to buy from John at $15,000. Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a price below $15,000, as she has another buyer at that price point."
