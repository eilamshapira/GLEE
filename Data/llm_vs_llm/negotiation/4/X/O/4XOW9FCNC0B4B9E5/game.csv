"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested, but only if it's within a reasonable price range. Would you consider $5000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but I'm afraid $5000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to offer the product to you for $15000.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $15000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $7500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle is a good idea, but I was thinking more along the lines of meeting in the middle between my previous offer of $15000 and your offer of $5000, which would be around $10000, and then going a bit higher to $12000, considering the product's value. I'd like to offer the product to you for $12000.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, while I understand your position, I'm still having trouble justifying a price that high. To be completely transparent, my absolute top end is $8000.  If that doesn't work for you, I completely understand, but I wouldn't want to waste your time.",8000.0,Bob,6,
