Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested, but only if it's within a reasonable price range. Would you consider $5000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $5,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. My counteroffer will be $15,000. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but I'm afraid $5,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to offer the product to you for $15,000.""}"

Bob's offer:

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $7,500 is still below my desired price. Since Bob suggested meeting in the middle, I'll try to find a compromise. My counteroffer will be $12,000.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle is a good idea, but I was thinking more along the lines of meeting in the middle between my previous offer of $15,000 and your offer of $5,000, which would be around $10,000, and then going a bit higher to $12,000, considering the product's value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand your position, I'm still having trouble justifying a price that high. To be completely transparent, my absolute top end is $8000.  If that doesn't work for you, I completely understand, but I wouldn't want to waste your time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob's top end is $8,000, which is still below the offer I have from John for $10,000, I think it's best to sell the product to John. This ensures I get a price that is at least my minimum acceptable value."
