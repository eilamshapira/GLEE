Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but I'm afraid $5000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to offer the product to you for $15000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle is a good idea, but I was thinking more along the lines of meeting in the middle between my previous offer of $15000 and your offer of $5000, which would be around $10000, and then going a bit higher to $12000, considering the product's value. I'd like to offer the product to you for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
