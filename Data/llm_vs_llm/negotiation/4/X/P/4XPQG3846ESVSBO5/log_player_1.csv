Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $250. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $250 is above my budget. Would you consider $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, but I want to try negotiating with Bob before settling for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but $100 is too low for this product's value. I can come down from my initial price - how about $200? This is a significant reduction and represents excellent value for the quality you're getting."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $200 is still out of my budget. Would you consider $120 for the product? I believe it's a fair price considering my constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John since Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and his latest offer of $120 suggests he's unlikely to reach my minimum price point. John's guaranteed offer of $150 is the better business decision."
