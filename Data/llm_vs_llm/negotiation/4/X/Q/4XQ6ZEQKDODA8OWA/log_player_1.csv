Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $12500? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
