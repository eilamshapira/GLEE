"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $80 to me
2. John is willing to sell the product for $80
3. Alice's offer is $200, which is significantly higher than what I value the product at

I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, or simply buy from John. Since John's price matches exactly my maximum valuation, and there's no guarantee Alice would accept a reasonable counteroffer, the logical choice is:
