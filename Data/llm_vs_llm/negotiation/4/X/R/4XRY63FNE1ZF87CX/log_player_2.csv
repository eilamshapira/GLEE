"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm offering you first before selling it elsewhere. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $180. This product has excellent features and durability that make it well worth this price. Would you like to purchase it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Looking at Alice's offer, she's asking for $180 for the product. However, I know that:
1. The product is worth no more than $80 to me
2. I can buy the same product from John for $80

Alice's price of $180 is significantly higher than both the product's value to me and John's alternative offer. It wouldn't make financial sense to accept Alice's offer when I can get the same product for much less elsewhere.
