"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, we don't know Alice's bottom line. There's room for negotiation. We're aiming to save as much as possible within these 10 rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

We're starting with a strong counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening price. This probes the waters and gives us more information about Alice's potential bottom line.  Worst case, Alice counteroffers, and we can negotiate towards a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice reducing her price indicates some willingness to negotiate. We're still far from our ideal price range, so we'll reject and propose a counteroffer closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

We are nudging our offer up slightly to signal that we are willing to compromise, but we are still aiming for a significantly lower price than Alice's current offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

The gap is closing, but there's still room for negotiation.  We'll reject and counteroffer, aiming to settle somewhere between our last offer and Alice's current price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while pushing for a price closer to our goal. We're now in a good position to assess Alice's flexibility as we approach the halfway point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

We're getting close, but let's push a little further.  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate within this range. We'll send one more counteroffer before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

This counteroffer is a strong but fair price, especially given the remaining rounds. It puts the pressure on Alice while keeping us comfortably below John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

$910,000 is a very reasonable price, especially considering we are running out of rounds.  We've negotiated well and are getting the product for significantly less than John's offer. Accepting now secures the deal."
