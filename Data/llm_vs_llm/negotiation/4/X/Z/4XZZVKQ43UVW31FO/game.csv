"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1000000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $1000000 is too low for this product. Given that I have other interested buyers, I can offer it to you for $1350000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm afraid $1350000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $1150000? I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
