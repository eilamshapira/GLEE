"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll find our asking price of $1300000 quite reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's asking for $1,300,000, which is $300,000 more than the product is worth to me ($1,000,000). I also have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000.

Since Alice's current offer exceeds both my maximum valuation and John's price, there's no reason to accept it. I could try to negotiate with Alice, but I already have a guaranteed option to purchase at my maximum valuation from John.
