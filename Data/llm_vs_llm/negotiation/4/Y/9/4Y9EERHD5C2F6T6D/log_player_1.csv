"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. Considering its rarity and exceptional quality, I'm willing to let it go for $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $13000.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $13,000, and knowing I value the product at $15,000, I need to consider my options carefully. While $13,000 is below my value, I still have a limited number of rounds. Selling to John immediately gets me $15,000. It is not worth losing time and possibly selling the product for even less.

Therefore:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
