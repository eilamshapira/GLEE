"Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price Alice offered ($149) is very close to John's price ($150) and still higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($100). I'll reject and make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 110}

I'll offer $110, which is slightly above Alice's cost ($100). This gives Alice a small profit while being significantly better for me than the current offers of $149 from Alice or $150 from John. This leaves room for negotiation if Alice counters, but also demonstrates that I'm willing to give her a reasonable profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has lowered her price significantly from $149 to $140, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, there's still room for a better deal since the product is worth $100 to her. I'll reject and make another counteroffer that's higher than my previous one but still aims to get a better price than $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 120}

I'll increase my offer to $120, which is a significant step up from my previous offer of $110. This still gives me a good deal compared to both Alice's current offer ($140) and John's price ($150), while providing Alice with a reasonable $20 profit. This shows I'm willing to move toward a middle ground while still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $130. She's shown significant movement in the negotiation (from $149 to $140 to $130), and this price is now $20 less than John's alternative ($150). While we might be able to negotiate further, $130 represents a fair compromise - Alice gets a $30 profit, and I save $20 compared to my alternative option. The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Alice might become frustrated and stop negotiating, forcing me to pay $150 to John."
