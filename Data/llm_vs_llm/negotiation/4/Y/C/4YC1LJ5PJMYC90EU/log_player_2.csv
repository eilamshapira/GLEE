"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1200000. This is a competitive price for the value you'll receive. Would you be interested in making this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

 Alice's initial offer is higher than John's price. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but leaving room for further negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800000 is below what I can accept, I understand your concern about the initial price. Given the product's quality and value, I can offer it at $1000000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a fair price point that reflects the true value of the product while addressing your budget concerns. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice's offer now matches John's price.  There's no point in further negotiation at this point, as I am unlikely to secure a better deal from Alice. It's best to go with the guaranteed price from John."
