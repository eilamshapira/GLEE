"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the offer of $95 is less than my maximum willingness to pay of $100, and rejecting it means further negotiation which might not lead to a lower price (and carries the risk of Alice increasing her price), and also considering I have an alternative option to buy from John for $100, it's best to accept the offer of $95.
