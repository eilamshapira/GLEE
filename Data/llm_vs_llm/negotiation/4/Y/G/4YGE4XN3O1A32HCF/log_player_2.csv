"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I hope you're doing well. I have a unique product available, and I'm offering it to you today for $200. If this works for you, we can complete the sale right away. If not, no worries—I’ll be selling it to another buyer for $150. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Looking at the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $150 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $200
3. I can buy the same product from John for $150

Since Alice's offer ($200) exceeds the maximum value I place on the product ($150), and there's a guaranteed alternative to get the same product at exactly $150 from John, the economically rational choice is clear.
