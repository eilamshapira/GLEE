"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision that maximizes my value while minimizing cost.

The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $15,000, which exceeds my valuation.

Meanwhile, John is offering the same product for $8,000, which matches my maximum valuation.

The logical choice is to buy from John rather than accept Alice's significantly higher price.
