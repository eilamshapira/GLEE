"Thanks for your offer, Alice. However, $18000 is significantly above my budget. I've done my market research, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for less. I'm willing to offer $12000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more to make this work. Let's try $15000. This is my revised offer.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. We're getting closer, but since I can get this product elsewhere for $15000, I would need a slightly better offer to make it worth my while to buy from you. Would you consider $13500? This would make it an easy decision for me to choose you as my supplier.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work for both of us. Let's try $14000 flat. This is the best I can do right now.",14000.0,Alice,5,
