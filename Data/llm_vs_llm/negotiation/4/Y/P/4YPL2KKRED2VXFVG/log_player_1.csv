Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. However, $18000 is significantly above my budget. I've done my market research, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for less. I'm willing to offer $12000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. $12,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with considering the value and uniqueness of this product. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is a significant reduction from my original price, and I believe it's a very fair offer."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. We're getting closer, but since I can get this product elsewhere for $15000, I would need a slightly better offer to make it worth my while to buy from you. Would you consider $13500? This would make it an easy decision for me to choose you as my supplier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work for both of us. Let's try $14,000 flat. This is the best I can do right now."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
