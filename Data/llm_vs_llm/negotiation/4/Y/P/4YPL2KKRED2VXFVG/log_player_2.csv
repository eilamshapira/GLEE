"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited you're interested in this product. It's truly exceptional. To start our discussion, I'm offering it to you for $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $18,000
2. My maximum value for the product is $15,000
3. John is willing to sell it for $15,000
4. Alice's initial offer is $3,000 above my maximum value

Alice's opening offer is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's price. There's no reason to accept this offer when I can get it cheaper from John. However, since we have 10 rounds of negotiation available, it makes sense to try negotiating with Alice first to potentially get an even better deal than John's price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's below John's price to try to get a better deal, but not so low that it would be considered unreasonable given Alice's initial offer.

{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I've done my market research, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for less. I'm willing to offer $12,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more to make this work. Let's try $15000. This is my revised offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let's analyze this situation:

1. Alice has now offered $15,000
2. This is exactly the same price as John's offer
3. This is also exactly my maximum value for the product
4. We still have several rounds of negotiation left

Since Alice's price has matched John's price but isn't better than it, and since it's at my maximum value, there's no particular advantage to accepting Alice's offer over buying from John. However, since we have more negotiation rounds available, we could try one more time to get a better price from Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has shown willingness to negotiate down from $18,000 to $15,000, I'll try one more time to get a slightly better deal before potentially accepting her offer or going with John's option.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. We're getting closer, but since I can get this product elsewhere for $15,000, I would need a slightly better offer to make it worth my while to buy from you. Would you consider $13,500? This would make it an easy decision for me to choose you as my supplier."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm really trying to make this work for both of us. Let's try $14000 flat. This is the best I can do right now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","This is a good offer to analyze:

1. Alice has now offered $14,000
2. This is $1,000 less than John's price ($15,000)
3. This is $1,000 less than my maximum value
4. Alice has stated this is ""the best I can do right now""
5. We've seen consistent progress in the negotiation from $18,000 → $15,000 → $14,000

This is a good deal because:
- It saves me $1,000 compared to buying from John
- It's below my maximum value
- Alice has indicated this is her best offer
- The negotiation pattern suggests this might be close to her bottom line
