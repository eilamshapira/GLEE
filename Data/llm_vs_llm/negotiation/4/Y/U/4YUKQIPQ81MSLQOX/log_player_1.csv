Send your offer to Bob.,"I want to start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 (and also below John's guaranteed offer), it wouldn't be wise to accept it. While I could continue negotiating with Bob, since I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $800,000, and Bob's first counter was quite low, I'll take the sure deal with John.
