"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since John is offering the same price ($120) as Alice, and knowing that I value the product at $120, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. This gives me a chance to potentially get the product for a lower price. If the negotiation doesn't work out, I can always fall back on John's offer later.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a significantly lower offer to leave room for negotiation, aiming to get the price well below $120.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has significantly reduced the price from $120 to $100, which is a good deal considering John's fixed price is $120. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might increase the price again or end negotiations. Since $100 represents a clear $20 savings from my maximum value and John's price, I should take this offer.
