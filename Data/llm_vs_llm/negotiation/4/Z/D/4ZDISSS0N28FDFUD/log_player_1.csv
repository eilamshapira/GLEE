Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a good price to offer Bob.

First, I know the product is worth at least $120 to me, since I can always sell it to John for that amount. This establishes my minimum acceptable price.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I need to set a price that has a reasonable chance of being accepted while also giving me a good profit. If I set the price too high, Bob might reject it, and I'd only get $120 from John. If I set it too low, I might leave money on the table.

A reasonable approach would be to offer Bob a price that's meaningfully higher than my $120 floor, but not so high that it's likely to be rejected.
