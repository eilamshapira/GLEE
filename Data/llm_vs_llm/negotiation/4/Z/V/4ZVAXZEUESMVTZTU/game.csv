"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a much lower price. I'm interested in the product, but $5000000 is out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.",400000.0,Bob,2,
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, I can't accept an offer of $400000. I'm still confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you somewhere in the middle. My counteroffer is $4000000.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $4000000 is still significantly higher than I'm comfortable paying.

I'm thinking more along the lines of $600000, which is a serious commitment from my side.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm glad we're making progress, but $3000000 is still far beyond my budget. I'm starting to think that we might not be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.
