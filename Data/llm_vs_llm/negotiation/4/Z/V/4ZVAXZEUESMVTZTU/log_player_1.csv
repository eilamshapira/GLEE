Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product. Given its exceptional qualities and rarity, I'm offering it to you for $5,000,000."", ""product_price"": 5000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a much lower price. I'm interested in the product, but $5000000 is out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $400,000, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, I can't accept an offer of $400,000. I'm still confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you somewhere in the middle. My counteroffer is $4,000,000.""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your initial hesitation, but I believe the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. My counteroffer is $4,000,000."", ""product_price"": 4000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $4000000 is still significantly higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to have to make a more substantial counteroffer if we're going to reach an agreement. I'm thinking more along the lines of $600000, which is a serious commitment from my side. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new counteroffer of $600,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Although I want to get a higher price, this offer is still not that bad.
I have to consider the risk of Bob rejecting my next offer. If he does, I risk getting an even lower offer later on, or worse, no offer at all.
Therefore, I will now reject Bob's offer, and proceed to the next round, where I will send him a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Bob, I see your perspective and I understand. However, I'm confident in the uniqueness of this product. Given the market value, I can't go down to $600,000. My counteroffer to you is $3,000,000.""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a higher counter offer. I'm willing to come down even further, considering the value of our negotiation. My counteroffer is $3,000,000."", ""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're making progress, but $3000000 is still far beyond my budget. I'm starting to think that we might not be able to reach a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your current price, which would be $1800000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. However, if I accept, I will make a profit of $800,000.

Since I am confident that the offer of $1,800,000 is much better than what John can give, I will accept Bob's offer.
