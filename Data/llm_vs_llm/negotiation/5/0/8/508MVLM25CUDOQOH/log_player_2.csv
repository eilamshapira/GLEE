"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
2. John's fixed price is $12,000
3. Alice's offer is $10,000, which is $2,000 less than my maximum value
4. I still have 9 more rounds to negotiate
5. However, $10,000 is already a good price, saving me $2,000 compared to John's offer

While I could try to negotiate for an even lower price, $10,000 is already a good deal, saving me $2,000. There's also a risk that if I reject this offer, future negotiations might not lead to a better price, and I could end up having to pay more.
