"Alice's offer: The product price will be $151. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $151
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","The price Alice is offering ($151) is more than what the product is worth to me (which is no more than $100). Additionally, I can buy the same product from John for $100, which is a better deal.

Since my goal is to save as much money as possible while buying the product, the logical choice is to buy from John.
