"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice is offering the product for $150, which is higher than the $100 I value it at. Since John is willing to sell the same product for $100, there's no reason for me to accept Alice's offer at $150.

I could reject and make a counteroffer, but since John's price of $100 matches my maximum valuation, the most logical decision is to simply buy from John.
