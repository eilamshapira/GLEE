"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $800000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800000 is the minimum I can accept from another buyer, so I need to consider that. I'm willing to meet you halfway though. How about $1000000? Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the value of this product justifies a higher price. Let's settle at $950000. This is a fair compromise considering my minimum threshold and your budget constraints. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $950000 is closer, I'm afraid I can't meet that price point. How about we meet in the middle at $875000 and call it a deal?",875000.0,Bob,4,
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $875000 is still below what I'm hoping to achieve. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. How about $912500? This is a fair step towards your offer while still respecting the value of the product. What do you think?",912500.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I need to push a bit more to meet my goals. How about we settle at $900000? This is a reasonable compromise and reflects the high value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
