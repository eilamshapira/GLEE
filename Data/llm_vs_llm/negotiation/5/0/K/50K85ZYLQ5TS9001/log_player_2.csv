"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its exceptional worth, I'm setting a price that reflects its potential value to you, while also considering alternative offers I have on the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is higher than my maximum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and also higher than John's price, I should reject it and buy from John.
