"Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $11000. This is a great opportunity considering its value and quality. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product quality, $11000 is still a bit high for my budget. The market value for similar products is lower, and I'm looking to spend around $9000 for this purchase. This would still give you a good profit while fitting my budget constraints. Would you be able to meet me at this price point?",9000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, I believe the value of the product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $10000, which I think is a fair compromise given the product's worth and market value. What do you say?",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, considering your budget and the value of the product, I'm willing to adjust the price further to $9500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if this works for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
