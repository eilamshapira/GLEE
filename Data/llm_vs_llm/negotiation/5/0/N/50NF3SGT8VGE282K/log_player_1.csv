"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $11,000. This is a great opportunity considering its value and quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product quality, $11000 is still a bit high for my budget. The market value for similar products is lower, and I'm looking to spend around $9000 for this purchase. This would still give you a good profit while fitting my budget constraints. Would you be able to meet me at this price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, I believe the value of the product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which I think is a fair compromise given the product's worth and market value. What do you say?""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, considering your budget and the value of the product, I'm willing to adjust the price further to $9,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
