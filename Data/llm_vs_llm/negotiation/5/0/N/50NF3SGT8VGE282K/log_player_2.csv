"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $11000. This is a great opportunity considering its value and quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's offer of $11,000 is lower than John's price of $12,000, but there's still room for negotiation since the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice. I should try to negotiate a better price before accepting.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product quality, $11,000 is still a bit high for my budget. The market value for similar products is lower, and I'm looking to spend around $9,000 for this purchase. This would still give you a good profit while fitting my budget constraints. Would you be able to meet me at this price point?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, considering your budget and the value of the product, I'm willing to adjust the price further to $9500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her offer significantly from $11,000 to $9,500, which is a good sign. This is substantially better than John's price of $12,000, and we're getting closer to a good deal. While I could try to negotiate further for a slightly better price, $9,500 represents a good value given that the product is worth up to $12,000 to me, and we've made good progress in just a few rounds. I'll accept this offer.
