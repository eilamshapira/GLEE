"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1100000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better price. John's offer of $1,200,000 serves as a fallback option, but there's room for negotiation with Alice. By rejecting this initial offer, you might prompt Alice to propose a lower price, closer to her product valuation of $800,000."
