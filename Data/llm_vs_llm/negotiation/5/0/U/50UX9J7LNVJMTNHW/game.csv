"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $25000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $18000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on this item.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $18000 is still below what I'm looking for given the product's value. I can come down to $22000, which I believe is a fair compromise between our positions. This price reflects the quality and worth of the product while also showing my willingness to work with you.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $22000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $20000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm confident we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",20000.0,Bob,4,
