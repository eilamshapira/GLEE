"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $25,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $18000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on this item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. While $18,000 is above my minimum threshold, I believe there's still room for negotiation since my initial offer was $25,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $18,000 is still below what I'm looking for given the product's value. I can come down to $22,000, which I believe is a fair compromise between our positions. This price reflects the quality and worth of the product while also showing my willingness to work with you."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $22000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $20000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm confident we can find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $20,000. This is a reasonable compromise that provides me with a good profit margin above my minimum threshold of $15,000, and we've reached a middle ground between our initial positions. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether, and $20,000 is a satisfactory outcome."
