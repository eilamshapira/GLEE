"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I can't go down to $60, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $180?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $180 is still much higher than what I can pay. I want to be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $80. I can go up to $70 for your product, but anything higher than that and I'll need to go with the other seller.",70.0,Bob,4,
