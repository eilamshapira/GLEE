Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I've got a great product for you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $200."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is too high for me. I can get a similar product from another seller for $80. I would be willing to pay $60 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, I need to make a decision. Selling to Bob for $60 is not ideal, as I value the product at $150 and could sell it to John for that much. However, I might be able to get a better price from Bob. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I can't go down to $60, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $180?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $180 is still much higher than what I can pay. I want to be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $80. I can go up to $70 for your product, but anything higher than that and I'll need to go with the other seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","This is getting tricky. Bob's offer of $70 is still significantly less than what I could get from John ($150). Bob has clearly stated he has other options, and it's likely he won't go much higher. I'm going to cut my losses and sell to John.
