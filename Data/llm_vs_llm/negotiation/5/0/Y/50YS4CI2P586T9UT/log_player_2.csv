"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I've got a great product for you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $200 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $80. It's also much higher than John's offer of $80. However, I'll reject and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $200 is too high for me. I can get a similar product from another seller for $80. I would be willing to pay $60 for your product."", ""product_price"": 60}

I'm starting with a lower offer than my maximum value of $80 to leave room for negotiation, while also mentioning the alternative option I have to create some pressure for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I can't go down to $60, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $180? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $180 is still well above both my maximum value ($80) and John's offer ($80). While she did reduce the price, the reduction isn't significant enough. I'll reject and try another counteroffer, but if Alice doesn't come down significantly in price, I'll need to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $180 is still much higher than what I can pay. I want to be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $80. I can go up to $70 for your product, but anything higher than that and I'll need to go with the other seller."", ""product_price"": 70}

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show good faith in negotiating, while being clear about my alternative option. This helps establish that I have a strong BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement) with John's offer at $80, which should signal to Alice that she needs to significantly lower her price if she wants to make a deal."
