"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you at a competitive price. I've taken into consideration its worth to you and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price. Considering the product's worth to me, I'd like to make a counteroffer.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering the product's worth to you is $12000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to propose a price of $11500.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a price that's closer to the midpoint between your original valuation of $10000 and my maximum budget of $12000. I think $10500 would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $10500. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I was thinking that since the product is worth $12000 to you, we could meet somewhere in between your offer and the product's value to you. I'd like to propose a price of $11000, which is still a discount from the product's value to you, but closer to my target price.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer of $11000. I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to meet at that price point. Considering we've both made concessions, I'd like to propose a price that's slightly higher than my previous offer, but still lower than your current offer. I think $10750 would be a fair compromise.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $10750. I appreciate your willingness to compromise and meet me halfway. I'm getting closer to being comfortable with the price, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. Considering the product's value to you is $12000, I'd like to suggest a price of $10900. This is a small increase from your offer, but it would bring us very close to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10900.0,Alice,7,
