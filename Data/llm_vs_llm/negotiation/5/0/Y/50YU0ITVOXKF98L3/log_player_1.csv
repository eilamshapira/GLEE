"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price. Considering the product's worth to me, I'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is below my minimum threshold of $10,000, I will not accept it. Additionally, selling to John for $10,000 is a better option than accepting Bob's offer, but I still believe I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a price that's closer to the midpoint between your original valuation of $10000 and my maximum budget of $12000. I think $10500 would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $10,500 is higher than my minimum threshold of $10,000 and also higher than the offer from John. Since Bob's maximum budget is $12,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation to get a better price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $10,500. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I was thinking that since the product is worth $12,000 to you, we could meet somewhere in between your offer and the product's value to you. I'd like to propose a price of $11,000, which is still a discount from the product's value to you, but closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 11000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer of $11000. I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to meet at that price point. Considering we've both made concessions, I'd like to propose a price that's slightly higher than my previous offer, but still lower than your current offer. I think $10750 would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $10,750 is getting closer to my target price, and it's higher than the offer from John. Considering we're halfway through the negotiation rounds, I think it's a good idea to try to close the deal. However, I'd like to try to squeeze out a bit more value.
