Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $10500. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I was thinking that since the product is worth $12000 to you, we could meet somewhere in between your offer and the product's value to you. I'd like to propose a price of $11000, which is still a discount from the product's value to you, but closer to my target price.

However, I'm still a bit hesitant to meet at that price point.

This is a small increase from your offer, but it would bring us very close to a mutually beneficial agreement.
