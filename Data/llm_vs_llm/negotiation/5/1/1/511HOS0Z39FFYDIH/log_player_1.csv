Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Considering that Bob's offer of $100 is above my minimum value of $80, and it's a reasonable counter to my initial high offer, I'll accept his offer.
