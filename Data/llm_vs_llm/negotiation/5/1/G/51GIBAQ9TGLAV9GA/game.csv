"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's truly valuable and I believe it will be a great asset to your business.  I'm starting with a price of $900000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for exactly $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you consider selling it for $750000? This would save me some money compared to my alternative option while still providing you with a good sale.",750000.0,Bob,2,
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750000 is simply too low for me. I am willing to come down to $850000 to reflect your concerns, and I believe this is still a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue this conversation.  I appreciate your understanding of the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's close this deal at $825000. This price represents a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. ",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be completely transparent - I have a firm cap at $800000 for this product, which is exactly what John is offering me. In fact, to make it worth my while to continue our negotiation rather than simply going with John's offer, I would need you to beat his price. I'm prepared to pay you $775000, which gives me a small savings while still being a reasonable offer considering the product's value. Can we make this work?",775000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I understand your situation and your need to be within your budget. I'm happy to make one final compromise to close this deal. I'm willing to go down to $790000. This is as low as I can go, but I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",790000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm coming down to $790000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I'm truly hoping we can reach an agreement. This price reflects your budget constraints while still allowing me to recoup a fair amount for this valuable product.",790000.0,Alice,5,
