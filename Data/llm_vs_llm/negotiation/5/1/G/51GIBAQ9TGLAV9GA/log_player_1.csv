Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for exactly $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. Would you consider selling it for $750000? This would save me some money compared to my alternative option while still providing you with a good sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be completely transparent - I have a firm cap at $800000 for this product, which is exactly what John is offering me. In fact, to make it worth my while to continue our negotiation rather than simply going with John's offer, I would need you to beat his price. I'm prepared to pay you $775000, which gives me a small savings while still being a reasonable offer considering the product's value. Can we make this work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
