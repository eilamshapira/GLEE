"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you today. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250. This is a fair market price for this item considering its quality and features. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $250 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $100 is unfortunately below what I can accept. This product is worth at least $150 to me based on its quality and market value. I could come down to $200, which is already a significant discount from my initial offer. Would that work for you?",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $150, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work.",150.0,Bob,4,
