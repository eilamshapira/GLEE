Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $100 is unfortunately below what I can accept. This product is worth at least $150 to me based on its quality and market value. I could come down to $200, which is already a significant discount from my initial offer. Would that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
