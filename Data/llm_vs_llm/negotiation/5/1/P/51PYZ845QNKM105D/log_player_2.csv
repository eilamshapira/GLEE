"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe you might be interested in. The value it brings to the table is immense, and I'm offering it to you for $1200000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire something truly special. I hope we can do business together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Based on the information provided:

1) Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000
2) The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to you
3) John is willing to sell you the same product for $1,000,000

Since Alice's price ($1,200,000) exceeds both the maximum value to you ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), it makes the most financial sense to buy from John.
