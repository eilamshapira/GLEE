Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 950000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I was looking to spend no more than $600000. Would you be willing to negotiate the price down to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob since his offer of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Furthermore, while I have John's guaranteed offer of $800,000 as a backup, there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob."

Bob's offer:

I'll sell to John for $800,000. Bob's offer of $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and given that Bob has already indicated he won't go above $700,000, it's unlikely we'll reach a price point that exceeds John's guaranteed offer of $800,000. It's best to take the sure deal with John rather than continue negotiations that may not lead to a better outcome."
