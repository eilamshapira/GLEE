"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product that I know would be valuable for you. Given its high quality and market value, I'm offering it at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential value to your business."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $950000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to offer $850000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $850,000 is above my minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round that's lower than my initial price but still above $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to get closer to the product's true value. Given its quality and the value it will bring to your business, I can come down to $920,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents excellent value for this product."", ""product_price"": 920000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $920000 is still too high. My budget is tight. I can offer you $870000. It's a serious offer and my final one for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob has increased his offer by $20,000, showing there's still room for negotiation. Since he values the product at $1,000,000, and his latest offer of $870,000 is a meaningful increase from his previous one, I'll continue negotiating with another counteroffer that shows more flexibility while still trying to capture more value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I've carefully considered your offer. I can reduce my price to $895,000, which is a substantial decrease from my previous asks. This price reflects both the true value of the product and my willingness to work with you to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 895000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. But I'm still aiming to save as much as possible. I can meet you in the middle at $882500. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $882,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $882,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $882,500. This is a good price that's significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and Bob has shown through multiple rounds that he's unlikely to go much higher. With only 4 rounds remaining and the risk of Bob walking away, this represents a good outcome that's reasonably close to my last asking price."
