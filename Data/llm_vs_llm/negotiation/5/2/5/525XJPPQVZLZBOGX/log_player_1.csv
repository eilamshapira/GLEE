"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a high offer to maximize my potential earnings. Considering the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, I'll start with an even higher price.

{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,000,000, I will not accept Bob's offer.

However, I still want to explore the possibility of getting a better deal from Bob, so I won't sell to John just yet.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $500,000, which is quite low, I'll make a counteroffer that is still high but slightly lower than my initial offer, to show that I'm willing to negotiate.

{""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $600,000 is still below the minimum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me. While it's an improvement from his previous offer, it's not enough to convince me to sell.

I'll reject Bob's offer again and consider making another counteroffer, as I still believe I can get a better deal from him.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer increased by $100,000 from $500,000 to $600,000, I'll respond by decreasing my counteroffer by a smaller amount, to show that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a high price.
