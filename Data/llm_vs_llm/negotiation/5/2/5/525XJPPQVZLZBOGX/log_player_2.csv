"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is far too high, being more than double my maximum value of $800,000. It makes more sense to reject and make a counteroffer. While I could immediately buy from John at $800,000, I'll try negotiating with Alice first to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be unreasonable.

{""product_price"": 500000}

This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial $2,000,000, but it's a reasonable starting point that gives room for negotiation while being well below my maximum of $800,000. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground, and I still have the option to buy from John at $800,000 if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice only reduced her price by $250,000, which is still more than twice my maximum value of $800,000. Since she's not showing significant movement towards a reasonable price, I'll reject and make another counteroffer. If we can't make substantial progress in the next rounds, I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 600000}

I'll increase my offer by $100,000 to show willingness to negotiate, but still maintain a good position well below my maximum of $800,000. Since Alice's last offer was still very high, I'm moving up gradually. If Alice continues to maintain very high prices, I can always resort to John's offer of $800,000, but for now, I'll try to secure a better deal through negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John for $800,000. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer of $1.5M is still nearly double my maximum value of $800,000
2. While Alice has shown some movement in price (from $2M to $1.75M to $1.5M), the reductions are relatively small
3. The pace of price reduction suggests we're unlikely to reach a price below $800,000 in the remaining rounds
4. John's guaranteed offer of $800,000 is at my maximum acceptable price
5. Rather than waste more rounds of negotiation, it's better to secure the deal with John now"
