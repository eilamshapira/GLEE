"Hello Bob, I have a special product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at a price of $18500. This is a competitive price considering the quality and benefits this product provides. I've had significant interest in this item, and in fact, John has already made a standing offer of $10000. However, I wanted to give you the first opportunity to acquire it. Let me know if you're interested.",18500.0,Alice,1,
