"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have this fantastic product you might be interested in. Given your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both my budget and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer. This accomplishes two things:

* **Gauges Alice's flexibility:** A strong counteroffer will reveal how willing Alice is to negotiate. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  Even if Alice rejects this offer, there's space to gradually increase my offer while staying well below my $100 budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $80 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice moved from her initial offer, $130 is still too high and not far off from her first offer.  It suggests she might not be very flexible. I'll continue negotiating, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a viable alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about $90?  That's a significant jump on my end."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to compromise:** I'm increasing my offer to demonstrate I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still below budget:**  My offer remains below my $100 limit. 
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer will give me a better idea of whether reaching a deal with Alice is realistic or if I should consider John's offer more seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a good deal, and I'm trying to be reasonable. However, I can't go that low. I'll meet you at $125. That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer, but $125 is still above my budget. Calling it her ""final offer"" might be a negotiating tactic.  I'm willing to see if she'll budge a little more, but I'm also very aware of John's offer at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate a bit. I'm willing to stretch my budget and offer $100.  However, that's the absolute maximum I can do."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm now at my absolute limit, matching John's offer.
* **Firm but polite:** I'm making it clear that this is my best offer while maintaining a respectful tone. 
* **Decision time for Alice:**  This forces Alice to make a choice between accepting my offer or potentially losing the sale."
