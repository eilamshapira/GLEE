"Hello Alice, thanks for presenting your product. While I appreciate its value, the price you're asking is quite steep for me. I'm interested but only if it's within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $6000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product and for making an offer. I understand that the initial price might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to consider your budget, but I can only go as low as $10000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's unique qualities.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with my budget a little. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations.  To be frank, $8000 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend on this product. If you're unable to meet that price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
