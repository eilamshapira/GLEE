Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for presenting your product. While I appreciate its value, the price you're asking is quite steep for me. I'm interested but only if it's within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $6000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. My counteroffer will be $10,000. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product and for making an offer. I understand that the initial price might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to consider your budget, but I can only go as low as $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's unique qualities."", ""product_price"": 10000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with my budget a little. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations.  To be frank, $8000 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend on this product. If you're unable to meet that price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:

Since Bob's offer of $8,000 matches the minimum price I'm willing to accept and also matches the price John is willing to pay, it's the best option to accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
