Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product and for making an offer. I understand that the initial price might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to consider your budget, but I can only go as low as $10000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's unique qualities. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

While Alice has come down in price, it's still significantly higher than John's offer. I'm willing to negotiate a bit further, but I won't go above $8,000."
