(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,000,000, I will reject her offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a price that is close to my maximum budget.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,150,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's a slight improvement from her initial offer, I'm not willing to pay that much. I'll reject her offer again and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice rejected my previous offer of $900,000 and came back with a price of $1,150,000, I'll try to meet her halfway. I'll increase my offer to $1,000,000, which is still my maximum budget. This is a reasonable compromise, and I hope Alice will consider it.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,100,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. At this point, I have to consider that I can buy the same product from John for $1,000,000, which is a better deal for me. Since Alice's offer is not getting close enough to my budget, and I have a better alternative, I'll choose to buy the product from John.
