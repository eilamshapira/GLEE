"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product to offer you today. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the detail on the product's quality. My budget is quite tight, so I would be willing to purchase the product for $100. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Since Bob started at $100 and I started at $180, I'll try to meet somewhere in the middle to find a mutually beneficial price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $100 is too low considering the product's value. I can offer it to you for $140, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This is a fair price for the quality you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value you're offering, Alice, and I really appreciate the price reduction. However, I have an alternative option that offers me the product for $120. If you can match that price, I'm ready to close the deal with you today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $120. This is a reasonable price that's above my minimum threshold of $100, and it's better than selling to John for $100. Given that we've gone through several rounds of negotiation and Bob has indicated he has an alternative option at this price point, this seems like a fair deal for both parties."
