Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. This product is high quality and would be a valuable addition for you.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $22000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $12000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't accept $12,000 as the product is worth significantly more than that. In fact, I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $15,000 for it. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $18,500, which is still a great value given what this product offers. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 18500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $18500 is still beyond what I can afford. Considering you mentioned John's offer of $15000, I'm willing to match that and go up to $13000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $13,000 is still below what I can accept for this product. As I mentioned, I already have John's offer at $15,000, which meets my minimum acceptable value. If you're able to beat John's offer even slightly at $15,500, I'd be happy to sell to you instead. This would allow me to make a small premium while giving you a product that's worth at least that amount to you. Is this something you could consider?"", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $15500 is just above what I'm willing to spend. Since John's offer is at $15000, I'm willing to go up to $14000. This is my final offer, as it's the maximum I can stretch my budget. Let me know if this works for you.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increase to $14,000. While this is getting closer, I'm afraid I must be firm on my position. Since I already have John's offer at $15,000, I need at least that amount to make the sale worthwhile. Given that this is your final negotiation round, I'm willing to meet you exactly at $15,000, the same as John's offer. This way, I can still work with you which I'd prefer, while meeting my minimum acceptable price. Is this something you can agree to?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
