"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. This product is high quality and would be a valuable addition for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $22000. This is a competitive price given the value this product would bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't accept $12000 as the product is worth significantly more than that. In fact, I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $15000 for it. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $18500, which is still a great value given what this product offers. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $18,500 is still beyond what I can afford. Considering you mentioned John's offer of $15,000, I'm willing to match that and go up to $13,000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. Let me know if this is something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $13000 is still below what I can accept for this product. As I mentioned, I already have John's offer at $15000, which meets my minimum acceptable value. If you're able to beat John's offer even slightly at $15500, I'd be happy to sell to you instead. This would allow me to make a small premium while giving you a product that's worth at least that amount to you. Is this something you could consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $15,500 is just above what I'm willing to spend. Since John's offer is at $15,000, I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is my final offer, as it's the maximum I can stretch my budget. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increase to $14000. While this is getting closer, I'm afraid I must be firm on my position. Since I already have John's offer at $15000, I need at least that amount to make the sale worthwhile. Given that this is your final negotiation round, I'm willing to meet you exactly at $15000, the same as John's offer. This way, I can still work with you which I'd prefer, while meeting my minimum acceptable price. Is this something you can agree to? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
