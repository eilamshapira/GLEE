"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will bring great value to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to let it go for a price of $17000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to consider Alice's offer of $17,000 against my alternatives.

The product is worth at most $10,000 to me, and I know I can buy it from John for exactly $10,000. Alice's offer of $17,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation and my alternative option.

Since Alice's offer exceeds what the product is worth to me, and I have a guaranteed alternative at a better price, the most rational decision is to go with option 3.
