Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I can't meet that price. I can do $13250.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Explanation: 

While Bob's offer of $13,250 is close to the desired price, it falls short of the guaranteed $15,000 from John. At this point, the risk of Bob backing out or further lowballing outweighs the potential for a slightly higher sale price.  Selling to John provides a certain and acceptable outcome."
