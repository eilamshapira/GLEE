"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be of great value to you. Given its exceptional quality and market positioning, I'm offering it at $1200000. This is a competitive price considering the product's capabilities and potential return on investment. Would you be interested in making this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $1,200,000
2. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me
3. John is offering the same product for $1,000,000

Since:
- Alice's offer ($1,200,000) is higher than the product's value to me ($1,000,000)
- John's offer ($1,000,000) matches the maximum value I place on the product
- Buying from Alice would mean overpaying by $200,000

The logical choice is to buy from John.
