"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price of $1,450,000 is too close to John's price of $1,500,000. Since Alice's cost is $1,200,000, there's room for negotiation to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer that's more favorable while still being profitable for Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1,300,000}

I'm offering $1,300,000, which is $100,000 above Alice's cost of $1,200,000. This gives Alice a reasonable profit margin while being significantly better than John's price of $1,500,000. This offer leaves room for negotiation if Alice counters, while still being a fair starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,420,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,420,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has lowered her price from $1,450,000 to $1,420,000, showing willingness to negotiate. However, there's still significant room for a better deal since her cost is $1,200,000. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. The $30,000 reduction suggests we can find a middle ground that works for both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1,350,000}

I'm increasing my previous offer by $50,000 to $1,350,000. This represents a significant profit of $150,000 for Alice over her cost of $1,200,000, while still being substantially lower than both her previous offer of $1,420,000 and John's price of $1,500,000. This shows I'm willing to move toward a middle ground while still seeking a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $1,400,000. She has shown significant movement from her initial price of $1,450,000, dropping $50,000 in total. The current price is $100,000 less than John's price, and while Alice is making a good profit ($200,000 above her cost), continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal or only achieving minimal additional savings. This represents a fair compromise between both parties."
