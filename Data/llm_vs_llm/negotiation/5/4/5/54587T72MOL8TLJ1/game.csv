"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $25000. This product has excellent features and durability that make it worth the investment. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts.",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is significantly above my budget. I've done my market research, and similar products are available for much less. I'd be willing to offer $12000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but I cannot accept $12000. This product is of premium quality with superior features compared to similar items on the market. My bottom line is $20000, which is already a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price reflects the true value and quality of the product. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to stay within a reasonable range of its actual worth.",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand this is a premium product, and I appreciate you lowering the price. However, $20000 is still beyond what I can justify spending. I have a reliable alternative offer for $15000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can increase my offer to $13500, which would be a fair price for both of us. How does that sound?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer. I understand you have budget constraints, but I also need to ensure I'm receiving fair value for this premium product. Given that you mentioned you have an alternative at $15000, and considering the superior quality of my product, I can come down to $17500. This is significantly lower than my initial offer and represents excellent value given the product's features and benefits. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",17500.0,Alice,5,
