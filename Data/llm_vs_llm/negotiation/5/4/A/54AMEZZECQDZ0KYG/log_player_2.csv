"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than my maximum budget of $1,500,000, I am willing to consider it. However, I also know that the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, which suggests there may be room for negotiation to get a better price.

Given that I have the option to buy from John for $1,500,000, which is my maximum budget, and considering Alice's initial offer is $1,400,000, I believe I can try to negotiate a better price with Alice.

Therefore, my decision is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer, hoping to get a price closer to $1,200,000 or at least lower than $1,400,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's initial offer was $1,400,000 and the product is worth $1,200,000 to her, I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than her initial offer but still reasonable, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle.

My counteroffer will be $1,250,000. This price is higher than what the product is worth to Alice, indicating I'm willing to pay a premium, but it's also lower than Alice's initial offer, showing I'm looking for a better deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has rejected my counteroffer of $1,250,000 and come back with a new offer of $1,350,000. This indicates that she is willing to negotiate but is not willing to go as low as I initially offered.

Given that Alice's new offer of $1,350,000 is still below my maximum budget of $1,500,000, and considering that she has already moved $50,000 from her initial offer of $1,400,000, it suggests that she may be willing to negotiate further.

However, the difference between Alice's new offer and my previous counteroffer is $100,000 ($1,350,000 - $1,250,000), which is a significant amount. Before making another counteroffer, I need to consider how much I'm willing to compromise.

Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible and Alice's offer is still $150,000 above what the product is worth to her, I believe there's room for further negotiation.

Therefore, my decision is to reject Alice's new offer and make another counteroffer, aiming to find a middle ground that is more favorable to me.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's latest offer of $1,350,000 and my previous counteroffer of $1,250,000, I'll try to find a middle ground that is more favorable to me while still being reasonable for Alice.

To encourage Alice to accept my offer, I'll slightly increase my previous counteroffer. My new counteroffer will be $1,280,000. This price is still below Alice's latest offer but higher than my previous counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to compromise.

By offering $1,280,000, I'm hoping to appeal to Alice's interest in selling the product while also saving as much money as possible for myself.
