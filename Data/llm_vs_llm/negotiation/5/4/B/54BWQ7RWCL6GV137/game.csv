"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm offering for sale. Based on my market research and the product's features, I'm offering it to you for $20000. I believe this represents excellent value for what you'll be receiving.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was looking to spend no more than $5000 on this product. Would you be willing to match this price? I believe it's still a fair amount considering the market and my budget.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand you have budget constraints, but I can't go that low as the product costs me no less than $12000. I could come down to $17500, which is already a substantial discount from my initial offer. This product offers excellent value at this price point.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $17500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $6000. I believe this is a fair middle ground considering my budget and the market value of the product.",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but I'm afraid $6000 still doesn't work for me. The product costs me $12000, which is my absolute minimum. I understand you have budget constraints, but I simply cannot sell below my cost. I can offer you $15000, which represents a significant $5000 reduction from my initial offer. This is a very competitive price for the value you'll receive.",15000.0,Alice,5,
