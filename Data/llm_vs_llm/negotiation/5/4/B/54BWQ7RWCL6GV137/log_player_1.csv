Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was looking to spend no more than $5000 on this product. Would you be willing to match this price? I believe it's still a fair amount considering the market and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand you have budget constraints, but I can't go that low as the product costs me no less than $12,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 still doesn't work for me.

I can offer you $15,000, which represents a significant $5,000 reduction from my initial offer. This is a very competitive price for the value you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
