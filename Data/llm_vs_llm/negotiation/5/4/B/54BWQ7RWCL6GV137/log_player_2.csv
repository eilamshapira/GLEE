Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand you have budget constraints, but I can't go that low as the product costs me no less than $12000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500

Counteroffer: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $17,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $6,000. I believe this is a fair middle ground considering my budget and the market value of the product."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but I'm afraid $6000 still doesn't work for me. The product costs me $12000, which is my absolute minimum. I understand you have budget constraints, but I simply cannot sell below my cost. I can offer you $15000, which represents a significant $5000 reduction from my initial offer. This is a very competitive price for the value you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
