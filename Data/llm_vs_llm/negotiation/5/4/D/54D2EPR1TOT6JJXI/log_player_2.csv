"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm open to negotiations, but I'll start with a price of $120. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price.  Alice's starting price suggests there might be room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That price is a little steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards if needed while staying well below John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not comfortable selling it for $80. I can offer you a discount from my original price, though. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than her initial offer, we're still potentially leaving money on the table. Let's see if we can get her down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price significantly lower than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I still think the product is worth more than $90. How about we settle at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$95 is a fair price, saving us a significant amount compared to John's offer.  It's likely close to the best deal we can get. Accepting now avoids the risk of Alice backing out completely."
