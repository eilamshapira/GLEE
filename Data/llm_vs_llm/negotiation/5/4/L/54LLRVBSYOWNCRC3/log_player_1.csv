Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this:

1. The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $1,500,000
3. Since Bob values it at $1,500,000, he might be willing to pay slightly more to secure the deal
4. However, if I ask for too much, Bob will reject and I'll have to sell to John

I'll offer the product at $1,600,000, which is slightly above both our minimum values. This gives Bob room to negotiate if needed, and if he rejects, I still have John's offer as a safety net.
