"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the chance to acquire this unique product. Based on its value and rarity, I'm offering it to you for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept it. While I could make a counteroffer, given that Alice's initial price is so much higher than my maximum value, it might be more efficient to simply take John's guaranteed offer.
