"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I believe will be a perfect fit for your needs. Considering its value and the market demand, I can offer it to you at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is lower than your maximum price, it's still a significant markup from Alice's perspective. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal, which might lead to a counteroffer closer to her valuation."
