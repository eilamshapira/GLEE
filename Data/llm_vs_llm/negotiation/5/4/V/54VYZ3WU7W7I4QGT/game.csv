"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2500000.

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I must say that $2500000 is significantly above my budget and the market value I've researched. I have another seller, John, who is offering a similar product for $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Based on my assessment of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $600000. This allows me some room in my budget while still giving you a fair profit. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600000 is significantly below the product's value. You mentioned John offering a similar product for $800000, but I can assure you that our product offers superior quality and features. Given this, and considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to adjust my price to $2100000. This is still a competitive price for the value you'll receive.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price, but $2100000 is still significantly above what I can justify for this purchase. While you mention superior quality and features, my market research and budget constraints indicate that the value proposition doesn't align at that price point. John's offer at $800000 represents the absolute maximum I can spend on this product. However, to continue our negotiation and account for any superior features you've mentioned, I'm willing to offer $700000. This is nearly the full extent of my budget and represents a substantial purchase for me. If we can't find common ground near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to proceed with John's offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
