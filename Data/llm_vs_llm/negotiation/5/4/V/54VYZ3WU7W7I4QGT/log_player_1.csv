Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I must say that $2500000 is significantly above my budget and the market value I've researched. I have another seller, John, who is offering a similar product for $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Based on my assessment of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $600000. This allows me some room in my budget while still giving you a fair profit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price, but $2100000 is still significantly above what I can justify for this purchase. While you mention superior quality and features, my market research and budget constraints indicate that the value proposition doesn't align at that price point. John's offer at $800000 represents the absolute maximum I can spend on this product. However, to continue our negotiation and account for any superior features you've mentioned, I'm willing to offer $700000. This is nearly the full extent of my budget and represents a substantial purchase for me. If we can't find common ground near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to proceed with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

{""message"": ""I apologize, Bob, but I cannot accept an offer that's less than half of the product's true value. Given that I have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,500,000, which better reflects the product's worth, I will proceed with selling to him. Thank you for your interest and time, but I must prioritize business decisions that align with the product's actual value. Good luck with your search.""}"
