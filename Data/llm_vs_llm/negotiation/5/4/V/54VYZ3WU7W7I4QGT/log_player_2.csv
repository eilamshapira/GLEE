"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2500000. This is a fair price considering the product's capabilities and potential return on investment. Would you be interested in making this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $2,500,000 (which is more than 3 times my maximum value), I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. However, since I also have the option to buy from John at exactly my maximum value ($800,000), I need to consider if negotiating with Alice might lead to a better deal.

Let me reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price before considering John's option.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I must say that $2,500,000 is significantly above my budget and the market value I've researched. I have another seller, John, who is offering a similar product for $800,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Based on my assessment of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $600,000. This allows me some room in my budget while still giving you a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600000 is significantly below the product's value. You mentioned John offering a similar product for $800000, but I can assure you that our product offers superior quality and features. Given this, and considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to adjust my price to $2100000. This is still a competitive price for the value you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $2,100,000 is still far above my maximum value of $800,000 for the product. While she claims superior quality and features, the price difference is too substantial to justify. Even with her reduction from the initial offer, the current price is still more than 2.5 times what the product is worth to me.

Since I can buy from John for exactly $800,000 (my maximum value), and Alice's price is still far too high, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating to see if Alice will come down to a reasonable price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price, but $2,100,000 is still significantly above what I can justify for this purchase. While you mention superior quality and features, my market research and budget constraints indicate that the value proposition doesn't align at that price point. John's offer at $800,000 represents the absolute maximum I can spend on this product. However, to continue our negotiation and account for any superior features you've mentioned, I'm willing to offer $700,000. This is nearly the full extent of my budget and represents a substantial purchase for me. If we can't find common ground near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to proceed with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
