Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $10,000."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $10,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially reaching a win-win scenario.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 gives me a strong position to hold firm if Bob tries to lowball."
