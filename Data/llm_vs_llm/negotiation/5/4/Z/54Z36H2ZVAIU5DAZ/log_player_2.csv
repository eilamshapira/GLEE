"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $10000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision that maximizes my benefit.

The product is worth up to $12,000 to me, and I have three options:
1. Accept Alice's offer of $10,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $12,000

Alice's offer of $10,000 is $2,000 less than what I would pay to John ($12,000). Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is below my maximum valuation, accepting her offer makes the most financial sense.
