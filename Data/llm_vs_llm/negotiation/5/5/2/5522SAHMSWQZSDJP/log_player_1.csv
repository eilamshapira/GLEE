Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1450000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. This is a fair price given my assessment of the product's value.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
