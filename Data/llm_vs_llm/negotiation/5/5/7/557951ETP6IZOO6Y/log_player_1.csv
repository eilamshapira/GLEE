Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, I believe your asking price is quite high. Given market conditions and comparable products, I would like to make a counteroffer of $900000. This represents a significant profit margin for you while being a more reasonable price point for me. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
