"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m pleased to present this exceptional product to you. Given its rarity and quality, I’m offering it at $1200000. This is a unique opportunity, and I believe the value is well reflected in this price. Please let me know if you’d like to proceed or discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice is offering the product at $1,200,000, which is exactly the same price as John's offer and equal to my maximum valuation, it would be better to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there should be room for negotiation to reach a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably above Alice's cost ($800,000) but significantly below her asking price, leaving room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, I believe your asking price is quite high. Given market conditions and comparable products, I would like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. This represents a significant profit margin for you while being a more reasonable price point for me. I look forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
