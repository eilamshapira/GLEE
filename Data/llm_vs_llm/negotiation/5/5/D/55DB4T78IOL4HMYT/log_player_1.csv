Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while staying under Bob's maximum value of $15,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","$12,000 is a good offer - it's significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and while it's less than my initial ask, it's still a reasonable price point. Given that continuing negotiations might risk Bob walking away, and it's better than John's guaranteed $10,000, I'll accept this offer.
