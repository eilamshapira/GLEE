"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value to you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate it, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. How about $12500 for the product? Let me know if that works for you.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $13500. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows for a smooth transaction. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still need to keep the price lower. How about $13000 for the product? I believe this would work for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",13000.0,Bob,6,
