{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your maximum price. You should definitely reject and counter-offer.  You have room to negotiate down towards your limit, and John's offer provides a good fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

This is a starting point. It's significantly below Alice's asking price but leaves room for negotiation. It also immediately lets Alice know you're serious about getting a good deal."

While Alice is coming down, the price is still too high. We should counter-offer again, but inch closer to John's price as a signal that we have an alternative."

Alice is clearly very reluctant to move much. We need to signal we're getting close to our limit and John's offer is looking more tempting."

This is a strategic increase to show we're willing to move, but we're getting close to walking away.  The next counter-offer should likely be our final one before seriously considering John's deal."

Alice is barely budging.  It's time to make our final offer, and if she doesn't accept, we'll go with John."

This is our final offer. If Alice rejects this, we take John's deal. This offer represents a significant saving and a fair compromise, considering her product valuation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,505,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,505,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is not negotiating reasonably.  We gave her a final offer and she countered with a negligible change. It's time to walk away and buy from John for $1,200,000. It's the best decision to guarantee the purchase while staying within our budget."
