"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $250. Let me know if you'd like to take it at this price!",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $250 is well beyond what I'm willing to pay for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a reasonable price. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $200. Let me know if this works for you.",200.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for the product. I'm willing to lower my price to $180. This is a good deal considering the quality and value of the product. Let me know if you can accept this offer.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for lowering your price, Alice, but $180 is still much higher than what I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I have a guaranteed option to purchase this for $100 from another seller. However, I'd be willing to pay $90 to buy from you instead. This is my best offer since I have a solid alternative at $100.",90.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to do business with you. Please let me know if this works for you.",160.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower the price further to $155. This is very close to my minimum, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you can accept this offer.",155.0,Alice,5,
