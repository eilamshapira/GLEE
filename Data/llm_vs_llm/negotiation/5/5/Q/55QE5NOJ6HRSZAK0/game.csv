"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I need to be honest - the product is worth no more than $10000 to me. In fact, I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $10000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I can't justify paying more than what the product is worth to me. I can offer you $8000, which would be a win for both of us - I save compared to John's price, and you make a sale. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
