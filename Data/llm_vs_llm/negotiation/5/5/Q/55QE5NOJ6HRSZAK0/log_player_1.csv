"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm excited to present you with a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I need to be honest - the product is worth no more than $10000 to me. In fact, I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $10000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I can't justify paying more than what the product is worth to me. I can offer you $8000, which would be a win for both of us - I save compared to John's price, and you make a sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
