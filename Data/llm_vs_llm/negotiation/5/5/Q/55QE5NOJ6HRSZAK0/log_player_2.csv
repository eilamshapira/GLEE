"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to present you with a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I'm offering it to you for $15000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to be careful here. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, but Alice is asking for $15,000. This is higher than both my maximum value and John's guaranteed price of $10,000.

Since Alice's initial offer exceeds what I'm willing to pay, and is higher than my alternative option, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I need to be honest - the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me. In fact, I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $10,000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I can't justify paying more than what the product is worth to me. I can offer you $8,000, which would be a win for both of us - I save compared to John's price, and you make a sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
