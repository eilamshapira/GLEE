"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1750000 is well above what I'm looking to spend on this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $1200000, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your counteroffer. While I understand your budget considerations, the inherent value and unique features of this product justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down from my initial asking price. How about $1600000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Your product is certainly valuable, but I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. I can increase my offer to $1350000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer. This is the most I can reasonably offer while maintaining the project's financial viability.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I acknowledge your increased offer and appreciate your commitment to this negotiation. Considering your budget limitations and my desire to reach an agreement, I'm prepared to lower the price again. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1500000?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
