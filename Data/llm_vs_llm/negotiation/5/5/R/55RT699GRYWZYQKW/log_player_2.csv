"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited about the potential of you acquiring this exceptional product. Its unique capabilities and potential for significant returns make it an invaluable asset. To begin, I'm offering it to you for $1750000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer ($1,750,000) is higher than both my maximum value ($1,500,000) and John's price ($1,500,000), it would not be rational to accept it. Since John's price equals my maximum value, I could get the product at that price, but let me first try negotiating with Alice to potentially get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price, giving room for negotiation while trying to get a better deal.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,750,000 is well above what I'm looking to spend on this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your counteroffer. While I understand your budget considerations, the inherent value and unique features of this product justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down from my initial asking price. How about $1600000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,600,000 is still above John's price of $1,500,000, and since John's price represents my maximum valuation, there's no reason to accept a higher price. However, Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing her price significantly. Let me try one more counteroffer to see if we can get a better deal than John's price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $1,750,000 to $1,600,000, showing significant flexibility, I'll increase my previous offer but still stay well below John's price to leave room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Your product is certainly valuable, but I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. I can increase my offer to $1,350,000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer. This is the most I can reasonably offer while maintaining the project's financial viability."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I acknowledge your increased offer and appreciate your commitment to this negotiation. Considering your budget limitations and my desire to reach an agreement, I'm prepared to lower the price again. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1500000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has now offered the same price as John ($1,500,000), which is also my maximum valuation. Since we've reached my maximum price point and there's no possibility of getting a better deal by further negotiation (as I wouldn't accept anything higher), and since there's no difference between Alice's and John's prices now, I might as well accept Alice's offer.
