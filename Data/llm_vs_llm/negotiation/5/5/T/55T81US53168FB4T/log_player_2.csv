"Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice's offer is $19,500, which is much higher than my maximum valuation of $10,000. Even if I valued the product at exactly $10,000, accepting Alice's offer would mean a loss of $9,500 for me.

John's offer is $10,000, which matches my maximum valuation. This would leave me with no surplus but also no loss.

Since Alice's initial offer is so high (even above her own valuation of $15,000), it makes sense to either reject and counteroffer or buy from John. Given the significant gap between Alice's offer and my valuation, I should buy from John rather than engage in what might be a lengthy negotiation with Alice.
