"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,500,000 is higher than my maximum value of $1,000,000, and it's also higher than John's price. There's no reason to accept this offer. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'll make a counteroffer of $700,000. This is significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000, which gives me room to negotiate upward if needed. If Alice's true value is below $700,000, she might accept. If not, we can continue negotiating, and I still have John's offer as a backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,400,000 is still above both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000). While Alice has reduced her price by $100,000, it's still not a good deal for me. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, as there's still room for negotiation. If we can't reach a better deal, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

I'll increase my previous offer to $800,000. This shows I'm willing to move up from my initial offer of $700,000, demonstrating flexibility in negotiation, while still staying well below both my maximum value and John's price. This gives me room to negotiate further if needed, while potentially being more attractive to Alice than my previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly above John's price of $1,000,000. While Alice continues to lower her price, she's still not offering a competitive deal. I'll reject and make another counteroffer. If Alice doesn't come down to a price below John's offer soon, it would make more sense to take John's deal, but for now, there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 850000}

I'll increase my offer to $850,000. This continues to show my willingness to negotiate by increasing my offer incrementally. It's still significantly below John's price of $1,000,000, which gives me both a safety margin and room for further negotiation. By gradually increasing my offers ($700K → $800K → $850K), I'm demonstrating good faith in the negotiation while trying to secure a better deal than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I think it's best to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($1,250,000) is still significantly above John's price ($1,000,000)
2. While Alice has been gradually reducing her price, the decrements are relatively small
3. We've gone through 7 rounds, and we're still $250,000 above John's price
4. Even if Alice continues reducing her price at the same rate, it's unlikely she'll go below John's price in the remaining rounds
5. There's a risk of losing more time in negotiation without reaching a better deal than John's

Therefore, it's most prudent to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 rather than continue negotiating with Alice."
