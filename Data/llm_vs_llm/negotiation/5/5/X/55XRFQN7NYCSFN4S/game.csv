"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, $17500 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $12000 to me, and I actually have another seller (John) who's willing to sell me the same product for exactly that amount. However, I'd like to do business with you if possible. I can offer you $10000 for the product, which would allow me to save some money compared to my alternative option.",10000.0,Bob,2,
