"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $17,500. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, $17500 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $12000 to me, and I actually have another seller (John) who's willing to sell me the same product for exactly that amount. However, I'd like to do business with you if possible. I can offer you $10000 for the product, which would allow me to save some money compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
