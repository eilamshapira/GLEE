"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $17500. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's initial offer of $17,500 is well above the maximum value of $12,000 that the product is worth to me. It's also significantly higher than John's guaranteed price of $12,000. Since I want to save as much money as possible, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, $17,500 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and I actually have another seller (John) who's willing to sell me the same product for exactly that amount. However, I'd like to do business with you if possible. I can offer you $10,000 for the product, which would allow me to save some money compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
