"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that budget is a concern. However, I'm not comfortable selling it for $10500. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I can offer it to you for $11150. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go without compromising the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11150.0,Alice,3,
