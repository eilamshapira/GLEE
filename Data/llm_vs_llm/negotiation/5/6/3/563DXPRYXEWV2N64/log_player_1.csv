Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,500 is higher than the minimum amount I'm willing to accept ($10,000) but lower than what I initially hoped for, and considering that selling to John would only get me $10,000, I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my initial offer or at least ensure I get more than Bob's current offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Considering Bob's offer of $10,500 and my initial offer of $12,000, I'll try to find a middle ground that still favors me but shows willingness to negotiate. A reasonable counteroffer would be slightly below my initial offer, aiming to meet Bob halfway between his offer and my initial price.
