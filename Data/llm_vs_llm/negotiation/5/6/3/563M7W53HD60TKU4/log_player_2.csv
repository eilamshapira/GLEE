"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $80 to me (maximum I'm willing to pay)
2. Alice is offering it for $120
3. John is willing to sell it for $80
4. My goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible

Since Alice's offer ($120) is above my maximum value ($80) and higher than John's price ($80), it makes the most sense to buy from John. I will get the product at my maximum acceptable price, which is also the lowest available option.
