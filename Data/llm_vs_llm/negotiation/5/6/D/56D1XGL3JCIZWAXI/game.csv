"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is quite high for this product. I've done some market research, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for $100. However, I'd like to work with you. Would you consider $85 for the product?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $85 is significantly below my bottom line. I'm willing to come down to $140. This offer reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I want to be transparent - I can purchase this product from another seller for $100, and that's really the maximum value for me. To make it worth both our while, I'm willing to offer $90, which would give you a quick sale and save me a bit compared to my other option.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident this product is worth more than $90. I'm willing to make my final offer at $115. This is a very competitive price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  Let me know your decision.",115.0,Alice,5,
