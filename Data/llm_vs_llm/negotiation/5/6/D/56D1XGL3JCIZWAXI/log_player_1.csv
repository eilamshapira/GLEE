Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is quite high for this product. I've done some market research, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for $100. However, I'd like to work with you. Would you consider $85 for the product?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I want to be transparent - I can purchase this product from another seller for $100, and that's really the maximum value for me.
