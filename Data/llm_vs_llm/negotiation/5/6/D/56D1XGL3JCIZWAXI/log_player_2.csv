"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
2. John is willing to sell it for $100
3. Alice's offer of $180 is significantly above both my maximum value and John's price

The logical choice is to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. I shouldn't accept $180 when I have a guaranteed option of $100, and the product isn't worth more than $100 to me anyway.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than John's price to give room for negotiation, but not so low as to be insulting.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is quite high for this product. I've done some market research, and I know I can get this product elsewhere for $100. However, I'd like to work with you. Would you consider $85 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $85 is significantly below my bottom line. I'm willing to come down to $140. This offer reflects the true value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer of $140 is still well above John's price of $100, and above my maximum value of $100, there's no reason to accept this offer. I can either continue negotiating or buy from John. Since I still have several rounds left for negotiation and Alice has shown willingness to reduce her price significantly (from $180 to $140), I'll reject and try another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down $40 from her initial offer, I'll increase my offer a bit to show good faith in the negotiation, but still keep it below John's price to maintain my bargaining position.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I want to be transparent - I can purchase this product from another seller for $100, and that's really the maximum value for me. To make it worth both our while, I'm willing to offer $90, which would give you a quick sale and save me a bit compared to my other option."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident this product is worth more than $90. I'm willing to make my final offer at $115. This is a very competitive price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer of $115 is still above John's price of $100, and Alice has stated this is her ""final offer"" and she's ""not willing to go any lower,"" it would be best to end the negotiation with Alice and take John's guaranteed offer of $100. This is especially true since the product is only worth $100 to me anyway.
