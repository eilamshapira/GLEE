Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product sounds interesting, but $95 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
