Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $18000 is significantly above my budget. I've been offered this same product elsewhere for $12000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. This gives you a chance to make the sale today without me having to go elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $10,000 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

My counteroffer is: $17,000. This price reflects the product's value and gives Bob a chance to acquire it at a competitive price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be out of your budget, but I also have to consider the product's value. Your offer of $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I can offer you the product for $17,000, which is still a competitive price considering its worth. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to continue negotiating."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17000 is still significantly higher than what I can justify paying. I mentioned I have an offer for $12000 elsewhere, which is actually my absolute maximum budget for this product. To give you my business instead, I can offer $11500. This is very close to my other option, but I'd rather work with you if we can reach a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $11,500 because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Although Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, I believe I can get a better deal either from him or from John.

My next step is to make another counteroffer to Bob, trying to meet him halfway while still being mindful of my minimum price. 

My counteroffer is: $16,000. This price is slightly lower than my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still reflects the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me and meet halfway. However, $11,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. Considering your budget and my own requirements, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $16,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This price takes into account the product's value and your competing offer. If you're serious about acquiring the product, I believe this is a fair price. Let me know if this works for you or if you need more time to consider."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price further to $16000. However, I need to be completely transparent - I cannot and will not pay more than $12000 for this product, as that is both my maximum budget and the exact price I've been offered elsewhere. At this point, I'm prepared to pay you $12000, which is the same as my alternative offer. This is my final offer, as anything higher simply doesn't make financial sense for me. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need a price that's competitive with the market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

I decide to sell the product to John for $15,000. Bob's final offer of $12,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I have a better alternative with John. Since Bob has stated that $12,000 is his maximum budget and final offer, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price. Given this, selling to John at $15,000 is the most profitable option for me."
