"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you for a competitive price. Let's start the negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's offer of $18,000 is well above the $12,000 that the product is worth to me, and it's also higher than John's guaranteed price of $12,000. It wouldn't make sense for me to accept this offer.

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. John's offer gives me a solid backup option, but I'll try negotiating with Alice first to see if I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I've been offered this same product elsewhere for $12,000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This gives you a chance to make the sale today without me having to go elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18000 might be out of your budget, but I also have to consider the product's value. Your offer of $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I can offer you the product for $17000, which is still a competitive price considering its worth. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to continue negotiating. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has only slightly reduced her price from $18,000 to $17,000, which is still well above both my maximum value of $12,000 and John's alternative offer of $12,000. This doesn't represent a significant movement toward a fair deal.

Since I can get the exact same product from John for $12,000, and that price equals my maximum value for the product, I should reject Alice's current offer and try one more counteroffer. If Alice doesn't come down significantly, I'll go with John's option.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17,000 is still significantly higher than what I can justify paying. I mentioned I have an offer for $12,000 elsewhere, which is actually my absolute maximum budget for this product. To give you my business instead, I can offer $11,500. This is very close to my other option, but I'd rather work with you if we can reach a fair agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me and meet halfway. However, $11500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. Considering your budget and my own requirements, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $16000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This price takes into account the product's value and your competing offer. If you're serious about acquiring the product, I believe this is a fair price. Let me know if this works for you or if you need more time to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price from $17,000 to $16,000, which shows some movement, but it's still $4,000 above my maximum value and John's alternative offer of $12,000. 

Since I can get the exact same product from John for $12,000, and that price equals my maximum value for the product, there's no reason for me to pay $16,000 to Alice. I'll reject this offer, but I'm getting closer to just accepting John's offer since Alice doesn't seem to be coming down to a competitive price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price further to $16,000. However, I need to be completely transparent - I cannot and will not pay more than $12,000 for this product, as that is both my maximum budget and the exact price I've been offered elsewhere. At this point, I'm prepared to pay you $12,000, which is the same as my alternative offer. This is my final offer, as anything higher simply doesn't make financial sense for me. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need a price that's competitive with the market."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
