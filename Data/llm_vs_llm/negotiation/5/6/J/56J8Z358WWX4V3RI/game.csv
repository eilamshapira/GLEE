"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $1800000. It's a steal considering its true value. I'm confident this product will be a game-changer for you. What do you say?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1800000 is out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $600000, which is a significant investment for me. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600000 is unfortunately too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering you the product for $1200000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a deal that will benefit both of us. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm interested in finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering my previous offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. I'm offering $750000, which is a significant stretch for me. I hope this offer is more acceptable to you.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, and I respect that.  However, $750000 is still significantly below the value of this product for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal.  I'm offering you the product for $900000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.
