"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $125. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Let me know if you're interested or if you have any questions about the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to evaluate Alice's offer against my alternatives:

- Alice is offering the product for $125
- The product is worth no more than $150 to me
- If I reject, I can buy from John for $150

Since Alice's price ($125) is less than both my maximum valuation ($150) and John's price ($150), accepting Alice's offer would save me $25 compared to buying from John.
