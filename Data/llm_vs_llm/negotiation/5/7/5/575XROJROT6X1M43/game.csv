"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $8000 is a bit too low for this product, I can come down from my initial price. Given the product's quality and value, I can offer it to you for $10000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
