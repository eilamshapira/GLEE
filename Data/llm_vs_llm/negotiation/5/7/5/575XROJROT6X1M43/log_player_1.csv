Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great value for you. I'm offering it for $12,000. This price reflects the quality and worth of the product. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, I was hoping to secure it for $8000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer is exactly the same as John's guaranteed offer ($8,000), and Bob seems willing to negotiate, I should try to get a better price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $8,000 is a bit too low for this product, I can come down from my initial price. Given the product's quality and value, I can offer it to you for $10,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
