,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential benefits, $15000 is quite a bit above my budget. Would you consider $6000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your response! However, $6000 is quite low for this product. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Let me know your thoughts!",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks, Alice, for considering my offer. $12000 is still higher than what I'm looking to spend. I can offer $7000. It's my best offer at this time.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that you have budget constraints, but $7000 is still below what I can accept. How about $10000? It's a great deal for this product and I think you'll find it's worth it. Let me know!",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $10000 is still too high for me. I am willing to increase my offer to $7500. This is as high as I can go. Please let me know if that works for you.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest! I understand your budget limitations, but $7500 is still below what I can accept. How about we settle on $9000? I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. Looking forward to your response!",9000.0,Alice,7,
