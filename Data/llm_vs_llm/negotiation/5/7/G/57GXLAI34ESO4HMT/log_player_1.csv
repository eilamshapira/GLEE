"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $15,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a high offer to Bob to see if there's potential for a better deal.

{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000 (and even below his own valuation of $8,000), and I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $15,000, I see no reason to continue negotiating with such a low offer.
