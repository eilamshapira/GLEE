"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Looking at the offers available to me:

Alice is offering the product for $15,000.
John is offering the product for $15,000.

Both offers are identical at $15,000, which is exactly at my maximum valuation for the product. Since there's no price advantage between the two sellers, I can choose either one.
