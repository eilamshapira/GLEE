"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the value proposition, the price is a bit over my budget. I'm willing to offer $700000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering market alternatives and my specific needs.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, I must inform you that $700000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I currently have another buyer willing to pay $800000, but I believe this product would be more valuable in your hands. I'm willing to reduce my initial price significantly - I can offer it to you for $1000000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer, reflecting my genuine interest in doing business with you. Would you consider this revised price?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1000000 is my alternative offer from another vendor. To make a deal with you worthwhile, I need a better price.  I'd be willing to go to $850000. This represents a significant move on my side and hopefully bridges the gap.",850000.0,Bob,4,
