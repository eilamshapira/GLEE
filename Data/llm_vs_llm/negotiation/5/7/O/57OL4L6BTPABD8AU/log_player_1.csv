"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,200,000. This is a competitive price for the product's capabilities and potential return on investment. Would you be interested in proceeding with this offer?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the value proposition, the price is a bit over my budget. I'm willing to offer $700000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering market alternatives and my specific needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll proceed with a counteroffer since Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 (which is what John is offering), but I still see potential to negotiate for a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, I must inform you that $700,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I currently have another buyer willing to pay $800,000, but I believe this product would be more valuable in your hands. I'm willing to reduce my initial price significantly - I can offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer, reflecting my genuine interest in doing business with you. Would you consider this revised price?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1000000 is my alternative offer from another vendor. To make a deal with you worthwhile, I need a better price.  I'd be willing to go to $850000. This represents a significant move on my side and hopefully bridges the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $850,000. This is a good outcome because:
1. It's $50,000 more than John's offer of $800,000
2. Bob has moved significantly up from his initial offer of $700,000
3. There's always a risk that further negotiation could lead Bob to walk away, leaving me with only John's lower offer
4. The price is reasonable given the initial negotiations and represents a fair compromise"
