Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, I must inform you that $700000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I currently have another buyer willing to pay $800000, but I believe this product would be more valuable in your hands. I'm willing to reduce my initial price significantly - I can offer it to you for $1000000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer, reflecting my genuine interest in doing business with you. Would you consider this revised price?
