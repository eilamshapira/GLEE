"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's offer. She is offering the product at $1,500,000, which is exactly the maximum value it's worth to me. It's also exactly the same price that John is offering as an alternative.

Since this is only round 1, and I have up to 10 rounds to negotiate, I should try to get a better price from Alice. There's no downside to rejecting this initial offer since I can always buy from John later for the same price if negotiations with Alice don't yield a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a significantly lower counteroffer to leave room for negotiation.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her price from $1,500,000 to $1,300,000, which is a significant reduction of $200,000. This is already a better deal than buying from John at $1,500,000. However, since we still have 7 more potential rounds of negotiation, I should try to negotiate for an even better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer but still aim for a price considerably lower than Alice's last offer.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her price further to $1,250,000, which is $250,000 less than John's price. She's showing willingness to negotiate, dropping her price by $50,000 from her previous offer. While this is already a good deal, I have 5 more potential rounds to negotiate and might be able to get an even better price.
