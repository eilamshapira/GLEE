"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it could be a great asset for you. I'm asking $25000 for it. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $25000 is way beyond my budget. I am willing to offer $5000 for the product.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $5000 is far too low for this product. Its unique qualities and potential benefits justify a higher price. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $22000.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $22000 is still too high for me. I understand the product has value, but my absolute maximum is $6000. Please let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about your maximum budget. However, accepting $6000 would be a significant loss for me. I'm willing to come down further, but I can't go that low. My absolute lowest is $20000. I am confident that you will find that the long-term value will be worth the investment.",20000.0,Alice,5,
