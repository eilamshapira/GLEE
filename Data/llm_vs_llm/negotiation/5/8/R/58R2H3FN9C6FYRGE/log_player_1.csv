"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{""product_price"": 2500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **High Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential valuation of the product. I want to see how high he's willing to go.
*   **Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, I create room to negotiate downwards in subsequent rounds if needed. This is a common negotiation tactic.
*   **John as Backup:** Knowing I have John willing to pay $1,500,000 provides a solid safety net. I can afford to be somewhat aggressive in the initial rounds.
*   **Information Gathering:** Bob's response (accept or reject, and the potential counteroffer) will provide valuable information about his valuation. This information will inform my strategy in later rounds.
*  **Profit Seeking:** I want to maximize my profit, and starting higher than the minimum is a good first step."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I would lose a significant amount of money by accepting this offer. Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 at any time, selling to Bob at $600,000 is completely unacceptable. I'm going to reject and see if I can pull him up closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's initial offer was extremely low. While it's a long shot, I'm only reducing the price slightly from my initial offer. This serves several purposes:

*   **Anchoring Effect:** It reinforces my initial valuation (albeit slightly reduced) and keeps the negotiation in a higher range than Bob's extremely low offer.
*   **Testing Bob's Limits:** It forces Bob to react and show more of his hand. Does he immediately jump up significantly, or is he truly committed to an extremely low price?
*   **Maintaining Profit Potential:** I still aim to maximize my profit.
*   **John as Safety Net:** I still have John willing to pay $1,500,000, so I can afford to maintain my position at a higher price.

I'm expecting Bob to reject this offer, but his response will tell me more about his strategy and willingness to negotiate. I'm essentially pushing back on his low offer to gauge his actual interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has only increased by $100,000, still leaving it significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Selling to Bob at $700,000 would result in a substantial loss compared to selling to John. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiations and hopefully reach a more acceptable price in subsequent rounds. I still believe there's potential for Bob to increase his offer significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's only increased his offer by $100,000. I need to see if there is any room to negotiate at all and how serious Bob is. I'll come down again to see if that incites any reaction.

* **Small Decrease:** The price is coming down slowly, but is still well above my minimum
*   **John as Safety Net:** I can sell to John at any time for $1,500,000
*   **Information Gathering:** Bob's response will tell me more about his strategy. If Bob's offer increases I'll be more willing to come down closer to my minimum.

I'm expecting Bob to reject this offer, but his response will tell me more about his strategy and willingness to negotiate. I'm essentially pushing back on his low offer to gauge his actual interest. If he's stuck at this $700,000, I'll likely sell to John in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is not even getting close to a reasonable offer. He is only increasing his offer by increments of $50,000 when the price is still less than half of the minimum I would accept. I'm confident that I can get $1,500,000 from John. Since I only have 4 rounds left, and Bob doesn't seem to even want to negotiate with me in good faith, it's time to move on. I have to assume the value to Bob is extremely low, or that he is negotiating in bad faith."
