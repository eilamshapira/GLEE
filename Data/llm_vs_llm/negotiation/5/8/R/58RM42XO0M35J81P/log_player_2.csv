"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","The offer from Alice is $250, which is way above the $80 limit of what the product is worth to me. Since John is willing to sell the product for exactly $80, I should either try to negotiate with Alice for a better price or buy from John.

Given that Alice's initial offer is so high ($250), it seems unlikely that she will come down to $80 or less in a reasonable number of rounds. I could try to negotiate, but with the guaranteed option of buying from John at $80, there's no reason to pay more than that.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $220 is still much higher than the $80 maximum value to me and higher than John's guaranteed price of $80. While Alice has reduced her price, it's still far from what would be acceptable to me.
