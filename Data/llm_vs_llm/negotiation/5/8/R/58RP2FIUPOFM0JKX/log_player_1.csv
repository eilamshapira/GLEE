"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Let me make my initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $12,000 to me (my minimum acceptable price) and I know Bob values it at $8,000, I'll start high to leave room for negotiation, but not so high that it immediately ends the conversation.

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and even below his own valuation of $8,000, this is not a good offer. Given that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, which meets my minimum price, and Bob's initial offer is so low, I'll sell to John rather than continue negotiations that are starting from such a low point.
