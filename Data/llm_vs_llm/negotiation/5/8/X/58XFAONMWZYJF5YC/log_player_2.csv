"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have an exclusive product available for you. I'm offering it at a price that reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Analyzing this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000
3. I can buy the same product from John for $1,000,000

Alice's offer is higher than both my maximum value and John's price. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer or continue negotiating when I have a guaranteed better option available.
