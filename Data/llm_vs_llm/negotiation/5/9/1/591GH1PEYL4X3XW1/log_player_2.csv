"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **Alice's Offer:** $95
*   **My Value:** $100 (maximum I'd pay)
*   **Alice's Cost:** $80
*   **John's Offer:** $100

I want to buy the product for as little as possible.

*   **Option 1 (Accept Alice's Offer):** I pay $95. This is acceptable because it's below my maximum of $100.
*   **Option 2 (Reject and Counteroffer):** This is risky. I might get a better price, but I also might end up paying more or not getting the product at all. The longer we negotiate, the higher the chance of me ending up with nothing.
*   **Option 3 (Buy from John):** I pay $100. This is the worst option, as I'd pay the maximum amount I'm willing to.

Since Alice's offer is below my maximum, and I want to save as much money as I can, I should accept it.
