Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make my initial offer to Bob. Since I know I can always sell to John for $100, I'll start relatively high to leave room for negotiation while potentially maximizing my profit.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100 (and below John's guaranteed offer), and I still have both the option to continue negotiating with Bob or sell to John, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's initial counter was quite low at $80, I'll come down from my initial offer but still maintain a price well above my minimum to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $90 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $100, and there's no indication that Bob will significantly increase his offer beyond $100, the rational choice is to take the guaranteed $100 from John.
