"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it for $12000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and market value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given Alice's offer of $12,000, which is $3,000 less than John's price ($15,000) and below the maximum value of the product to me ($15,000), this appears to be a good deal. While I could try to negotiate an even lower price with a counteroffer, the current offer already saves me a significant amount compared to my alternative.
