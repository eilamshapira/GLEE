"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it reflects the product's value.",1000000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the offer. However, considering the product's value and potential, I can't go that low. I am willing to come down to $2000000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it's a very good offer. Let me know what you think.",2000000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2000000 is still outside my price range. I'm prepared to offer $1500000, which reflects a significant compromise on my part.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  I'm eager to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,,
