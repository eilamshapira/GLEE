"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in your product, your price matches exactly what John is offering me for the same product. For me to consider buying from you instead, I'd need a better deal. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product, which I believe is fair considering the market value. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to lower my price to $1100000. Let me know what you think.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the product's value is higher than your current offer. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I think it reflects a fair compromise. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. That's definitely a step in the right direction. However, I believe there's still room for us to find a middle ground that works for both of us. I can increase my offer to $950000. This is a substantial amount and represents a fair value for the product. If we can agree on this price, we can close the deal immediately without further negotiation.",950000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your increased offer, Bob. I'm glad we're moving closer to an agreement. However, I believe the product's value is still higher than your current offer. I'm willing to lower my price further to $1000000. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm prepared to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1000000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
