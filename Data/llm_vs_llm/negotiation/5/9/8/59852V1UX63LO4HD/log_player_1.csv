Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in your product, your price matches exactly what John is offering me for the same product. For me to consider buying from you instead, I'd need a better deal. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product, which I believe is fair considering the market value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. That's definitely a step in the right direction. However, I believe there's still room for us to find a middle ground that works for both of us. I can increase my offer to $950000.
