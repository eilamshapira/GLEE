"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to evaluate this offer from Alice. She's offering the product at $1,200,000, which is exactly the same price John is offering and also the maximum value the product is worth to me. In this case, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's current offer since I could potentially negotiate a lower price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in your product, your price matches exactly what John is offering me for the same product. For me to consider buying from you instead, I'd need a better deal. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which I believe is fair considering the market value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the product's value is higher than your current offer. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I think it reflects a fair compromise. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $1,050,000, which is $150,000 less than John's price and my maximum value for the product. This is a significant improvement and represents real savings. However, there might still be room to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. That's definitely a step in the right direction. However, I believe there's still room for us to find a middle ground that works for both of us. I can increase my offer to $950,000. This is a substantial amount and represents a fair value for the product. If we can agree on this price, we can close the deal immediately without further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm prepared to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1000000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has now offered $1,000,000, which is $200,000 less than John's price and my maximum value. This is a very good offer, representing significant savings. While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has already come down considerably from her initial offer and is showing willingness to compromise. This price point is good enough that I should accept it rather than risk losing the deal by pushing too hard.
