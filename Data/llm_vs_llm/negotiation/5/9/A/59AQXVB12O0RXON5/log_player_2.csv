"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Analyzing the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $12,000
2. The product is worth at most $8,000 to me
3. John is offering the same product for $8,000
4. Alice values the product at $15,000, so she has room to negotiate down

Alice's current offer of $12,000 exceeds the value of the product to me and is higher than John's price. Even though I could try negotiating with Alice, there's no guarantee she'll go below $8,000, and John's offer is already at my maximum valuation.
