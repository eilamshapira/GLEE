"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10000. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the product's unique qualities. Please let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $10,000
3. John's fixed price is $12,000

Alice's offer at $10,000 is $2,000 less than John's price and below my maximum value. Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, I should accept Alice's offer. This will save me $2,000 compared to buying from John.
