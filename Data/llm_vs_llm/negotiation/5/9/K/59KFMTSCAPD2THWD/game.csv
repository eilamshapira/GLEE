"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, I need to be transparent that your asking price of $2500000 is much higher than what I can justify for this product. The product is worth no more than $1200000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell it at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $900000, which provides you with a quick sale while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
