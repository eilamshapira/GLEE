Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, I need to be transparent that your asking price of $2500000 is much higher than what I can justify for this product. The product is worth no more than $1200000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell it at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $900000, which provides you with a quick sale while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
