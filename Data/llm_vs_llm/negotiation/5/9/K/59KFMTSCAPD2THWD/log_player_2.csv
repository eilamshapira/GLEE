# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss an incredible opportunity with you. I am offering you my exclusive product at a price of $2500000. I believe this represents great value given its unique attributes and potential. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Based on the information provided, Alice's offer of $2,500,000 is significantly higher than the maximum value of $1,200,000 that the product is worth to me. It's also higher than John's guaranteed price of $1,200,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, I need to be transparent that your asking price of $2,500,000 is much higher than what I can justify for this product. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell it at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which provides you with a quick sale while giving me some savings compared to my alternative option. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
