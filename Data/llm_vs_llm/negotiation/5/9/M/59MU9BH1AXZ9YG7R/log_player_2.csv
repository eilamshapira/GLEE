"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $280. It's a really great deal and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $280. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $280
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since the product is only worth $80 to me and I have the option to buy it from John for $80, I would definitely reject Alice's offer of $280, which is significantly higher than both my valuation and John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $280 is way too high for me. I can actually get this product elsewhere for much less. I would be willing to pay $75 for it."", ""product_price"": 75}

I'm offering slightly below my maximum value ($80) to leave room for negotiation, while also letting Alice know that I have other options available. Since I can always buy from John at $80, there's no reason for me to offer more than that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $280 is a bit high. However, $75 is much too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $220. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $220. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $220
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's new offer of $220 is still far above my maximum value of $80. Since she only dropped the price from $280 to $220, it seems unlikely that she will come down to a price below $80 in future negotiations. Given that I can buy the product from John for $80 (which is my maximum value), the best decision is to end negotiations with Alice and buy from John instead."
