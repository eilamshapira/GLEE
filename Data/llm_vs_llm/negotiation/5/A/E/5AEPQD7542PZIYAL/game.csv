"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $120 is quite high for what I'm looking for. I've done some market research, and I believe a more reasonable price would be $60. This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but $60 is too low for me. I've taken your market research into consideration and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try to find a middle ground.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $100 is still more than I can justify spending. I could go up to $75, which I think is a fair price considering the market. This would be a good compromise between our positions.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Since you've come up to $75, I'm willing to come down a bit further. Let's try $90, which is a significant concession from my original price. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",90.0,Alice,5,
