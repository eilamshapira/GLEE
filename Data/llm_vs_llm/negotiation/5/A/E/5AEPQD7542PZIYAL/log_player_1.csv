"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair price."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $120 is quite high for what I'm looking for. I've done some market research, and I believe a more reasonable price would be $60. This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $60 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but $60 is too low for me. I've taken your market research into consideration and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $100 is still more than I can justify spending. I could go up to $75, which I think is a fair price considering the market. This would be a good compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer, as $75 is still slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $80, and I think I can get a better deal from Bob. I'll try to meet him closer to the middle between his offer and my previous counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Since you've come up to $75, I'm willing to come down a bit further. Let's try $90, which is a significant concession from my original price. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 90}"
