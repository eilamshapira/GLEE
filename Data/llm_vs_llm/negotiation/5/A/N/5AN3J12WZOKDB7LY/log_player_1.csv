"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be perfect for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential value."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you Alice, but I think $15000 is too high. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer since $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price and I can get $12,000 from John. Let me try to negotiate with Bob for a better price.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $10,000 is too low for this product. I can offer it to you for $13,500, which is a reasonable reduction from my initial price and reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $10,000 is too low for this product. I can offer it to you for $13,500, which is a reasonable reduction from my initial price and reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective Alice, but I can only offer $11000 for the product. I believe this price is fair and reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $12,000. Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below what John is willing to pay, and since Bob's last two offers have been significantly below my target price, it seems unlikely we'll reach a deal that exceeds John's offer of $12,000. It's best to secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John rather than risk further negotiation rounds with Bob."
