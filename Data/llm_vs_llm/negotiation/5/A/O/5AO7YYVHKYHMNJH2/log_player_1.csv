(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","The offer of $10,800 is better than John's $10,000, but I believe there's still room for negotiation since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob. I'll reject and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob has increased his offer to $11,000, which is a good price and represents a solid profit above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Bob becoming frustrated and withdrawing, and we've already used 4 rounds. This is a reasonable offer that's significantly better than John's $10,000, so I'll accept it.
