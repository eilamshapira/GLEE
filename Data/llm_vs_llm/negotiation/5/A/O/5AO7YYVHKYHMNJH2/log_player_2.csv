"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'll analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth up to $12,000 to me
2. Alice's first offer is $11,500
3. Alice's cost is $10,000
4. I have the alternative to buy from John at $12,000

Alice's initial offer of $11,500 is better than John's price of $12,000, but I should try to negotiate for a better price since there's a $1,500 gap between Alice's cost and her offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives us both some value. Since Alice's cost is $10,000 and the product is worth up to $12,000 to me, I'll propose a price that's better than her initial $11,500 offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I notice Alice has reduced her price from $11,500 to $11,200, which shows she's willing to negotiate. This is progress, but I believe there's still room for a better deal since her cost is $10,000. Her new offer is still $800 better than John's price of $12,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $11,500 to $11,200 (a $300 reduction), I'll move up from my previous offer of $10,800 to show good faith in the negotiation. I'll aim for a price that's closer to the middle ground between our positions.
