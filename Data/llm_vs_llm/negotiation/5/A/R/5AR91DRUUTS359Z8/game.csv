"Alice, thank you for your offer, but it's outside my acceptable range. I can offer you $600000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiationsâ€”let's work together to reach an agreement.",600000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thank you, Bob, for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600000 is still below what I'm comfortable selling the product for. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I need to feel that the price reflects the product's true value. I'm offering a compromise at $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,,
