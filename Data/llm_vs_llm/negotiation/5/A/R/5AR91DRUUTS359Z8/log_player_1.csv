"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its worth to me."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer, but it's outside my acceptable range. I can offer you $600000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiationsâ€”let's work together to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 900000} 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $600,000 because it's significantly lower than the product's value to me. Since Bob is willing to negotiate, I'll make a counteroffer of $900,000, which is still below my initial offer but shows a willingness to compromise. This gives Bob room to consider a higher price while also keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you, Bob, for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 is still below what I'm comfortable selling the product for. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I need to feel that the price reflects the product's true value. I'm offering a compromise at $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
