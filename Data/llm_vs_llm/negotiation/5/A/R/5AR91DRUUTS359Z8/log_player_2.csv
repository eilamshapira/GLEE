Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you, Bob, for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600000 is still below what I'm comfortable selling the product for. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I need to feel that the price reflects the product's true value. I'm offering a compromise at $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's worth.
