"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $950,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000 and also higher than John's price. It would be better to reject this offer and make a counteroffer to Alice, as there's potential to negotiate a better price. If the negotiation doesn't work out, I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 750000}

I'll offer $750,000 to Alice. This is a strategic counteroffer because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $800,000
2. It's below John's price of $800,000, giving me room to negotiate upward if needed
3. While it's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it still provides a decent return for Alice given her $1,000,000 valuation
4. If Alice rejects this offer, we can still negotiate to a higher price, but starting low gives me more room for negotiation
5. If negotiations fail, I still have the option to buy from John at $800,000"
