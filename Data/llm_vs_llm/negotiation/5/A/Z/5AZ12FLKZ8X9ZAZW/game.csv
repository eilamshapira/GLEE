"Hello Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I'm open to discussing the price further if you have a different offer in mind.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $11000 is quite high for this product. Given market conditions and product value, I would be willing to pay $9000, which would still give you a good profit margin. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $9000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle at $10000. This way, we both walk away with a good deal. Looking forward to your response.",10000.0,Alice,3,
