Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $11000 is quite high for this product. Given market conditions and product value, I would be willing to pay $9000, which would still give you a good profit margin. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
