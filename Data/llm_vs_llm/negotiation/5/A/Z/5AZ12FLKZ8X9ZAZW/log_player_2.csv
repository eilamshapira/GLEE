"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I'm open to discussing the price further if you have a different offer in mind. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
2. Alice's offer is $11,000
3. I know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice
4. John's fixed price is $12,000

Alice's offer of $11,000 is high considering the product is worth $8,000 to her. While it's below my maximum value of $12,000, there's room for negotiation. Since I can make a counteroffer and try to get a better price, I should reject this initial offer. Even if negotiations fail, I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably above Alice's cost but significantly lower than her initial offer:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $11,000 is quite high for this product. Given market conditions and product value, I would be willing to pay $9,000, which would still give you a good profit margin. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

This counteroffer is strategic because:
1. It's $1,000 above Alice's cost ($8,000), giving her a reasonable profit
2. It's significantly below her initial offer, giving room for negotiation
3. It's still well below my maximum value ($12,000), giving me room to increase if needed
4. I maintain John's offer ($12,000) as a backup option"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $9000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle at $10000. This way, we both walk away with a good deal. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has moved down from $11,000 to $10,000
2. This is a $2,000 profit for her (from her cost of $8,000)
3. It's $2,000 less than John's price
4. The negotiation is moving in a positive direction

While I could try to negotiate further, $10,000 is actually a pretty reasonable offer:
- It's significantly below my maximum value ($12,000)
- It represents a substantial savings compared to John's price
- Alice has made a meaningful concession from her initial offer
- There's a risk that if I push too hard, Alice might become less flexible

Given these factors, I think it's wise to accept this offer. The price is fair and the savings are substantial.
