"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm selling this amazing product. I think you'll love it. How about I offer it to you for $150?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $150 is a bit high for me. Given that I can find similar products elsewhere, I'd be comfortable paying $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, let's analyze this. I need to make a decision that maximizes my profit.

*   **Accept Bob's offer:** $90 profit, which is good.
*   **Reject Bob's offer:** I might get a higher offer later, but I risk Bob walking away, or getting offers that are lower than $90.
*   **Sell to John:** $80 profit, the minimum I can take.

Since I can get $90 now, which is more than the $80 from John and also gives me some room for negotiation, I will proceed with the negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to get a bit more for it. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
