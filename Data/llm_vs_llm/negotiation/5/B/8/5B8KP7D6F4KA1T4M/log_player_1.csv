"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,500 is higher than the minimum amount I'm willing to accept ($10,000) but lower than what I initially hoped for, and considering that selling to John would only get me $10,000, I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my initial offer or at least ensure I get more than Bob's current offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Considering Bob's offer of $10,500 and my initial offer of $12,000, I'll try to find a middle ground that still favors me but shows willingness to negotiate. A reasonable counteroffer would be slightly below my initial offer, aiming to meet Bob halfway between his offer and my initial price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's new offer of $11,000 is getting closer to a price that I consider reasonable, given that the product is worth $12,000 to him. Since his offer is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and also higher than what John is willing to pay, it's a better option than selling to John. However, I still have some room to negotiate, but considering Bob's willingness to increase his offer, accepting $11,000 might be the best choice to ensure the sale, as further negotiation might risk him pulling out or not being willing to go higher.
