"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, reject it and make a counteroffer, or buy from John.

Alice is offering the product at $12,000, which is the same price John is willing to sell it for, and it's the maximum amount the product is worth to me. Since the product is only worth $10,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation to get a better price.

I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, as this gives me a chance to save money compared to paying the full $12,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but gives me room to save money. Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice and up to $12,000 for me, I'll start with a price closer to Alice's cost.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price from $12,000 to $11,500, which is a good sign that she's willing to negotiate. This new price is already $500 less than John's offer, so I'm making progress. However, since the product only costs Alice $10,000, there's still room for a better deal.

I should reject this offer and continue negotiating to try to get a price closer to Alice's cost.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $12,000 to $11,500, showing willingness to negotiate, I'll increase my previous offer but still aim for a good deal. I'll split the difference between my previous offer ($10,500) and her current offer ($11,500).
