"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $50 is significantly lower than the minimum value of $120 that I have for the product, I will not accept it. Additionally, selling to John for $120 is a guaranteed option, but I want to try to negotiate a better price with Bob.

So, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

My counteroffer to Bob is: $180."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer of $70 is still lower than the minimum value of $120 that I have for the product. I will not accept it.

Although Bob's offer has increased from $50 to $70, it's still far from my desired price. However, I don't want to give up on the negotiation yet, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob.

So, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

My counteroffer to Bob is: $160."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer of $90 is getting closer to my minimum value of $120, but it's still lower. I will not accept it.

However, I notice that Bob's offers are increasing ($50, $70, $90), which suggests that he's interested in the product and willing to pay more. I'll try to meet him halfway.

So, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.
