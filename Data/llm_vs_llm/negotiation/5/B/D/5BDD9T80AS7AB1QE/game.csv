,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $850000 would be a fair price. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $850000 is below our minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which still represents a great value for the product. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the value this product brings to your business justifies a higher investment. How about we settle at $950000? This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and should meet you halfway.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900000 is the highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, $900000 is still a bit low for us. How about we settle at $925000? This is very close to your offer and should be a fair compromise.",925000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to drop the price to $915000. This is very close to your last offer and reflects my desire to close this deal with you.",915000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $907500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",907500.0,Bob,6,
