"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to make a decision based on the given options.

Alice's offer is $120, which is more than the product is worth to me (which is at most $100). 

Option 3 allows me to buy from John for $100, which matches the maximum value I place on the product.

Since Alice's initial offer exceeds what I'm willing to pay, and I have a guaranteed option to buy at $100 from John, there's no reason to accept the $120 offer or engage in further negotiation.
