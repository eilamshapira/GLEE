"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given Alice's offer of $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than the $800,000 maximum value of the product to me, and considering I can buy the same product from John for $800,000, the rational decision is clear.
