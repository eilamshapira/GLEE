"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I'm willing to sell. Given its quality and features, I believe a fair price would be $120. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'm playing as Bob, and I'm looking for a product worth no more than $80 to me. Alice is offering the product for $120, which is significantly above my valuation. Since John is willing to sell the same product for $80 (which matches my maximum valuation), it makes the most sense for me to buy from John instead of accepting Alice's high offer or continuing a negotiation that might not end favorably.
