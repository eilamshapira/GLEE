I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully gets Bob thinking about the value of the product.  I'm confident it's worth more than $1,000,000 to me, so I'm not afraid to ask for a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

Bob's offer was too low. I'm countering with $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still a respectable price. I believe this is a fair compromise that could lead to a deal."
