"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's alternative price ($1,200,000). It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. While I could immediately buy from John, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first to potentially get a better price. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 900000}

Reasoning: I'll start with a relatively low offer of $900,000, which is significantly below John's price of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate upward while still potentially getting a better deal than John's price. If Alice rejects this offer, I can gradually increase my price in subsequent rounds while still maintaining the option to go to John if needed. Starting low also helps me understand Alice's price flexibility through her counter-response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Reasoning: Alice has lowered her price to $1,200,000, which matches John's price and is equal to my maximum value for the product. At this point, there's no advantage in continuing negotiation because:
1. The price equals John's alternative offer
2. It's at my maximum acceptable value
3. Further negotiation might risk Alice increasing the price again
4. Even if I could negotiate further down, the potential savings might not be worth the risk of losing this acceptable deal

Therefore, it's best to accept this offer now."
