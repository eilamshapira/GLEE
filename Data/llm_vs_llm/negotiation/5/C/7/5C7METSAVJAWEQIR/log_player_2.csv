"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation.  I will reject the offer and propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a strong counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and my maximum price. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling that I'm looking for a good deal."
