"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for a competitive price. If you're interested, please let me know. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'm rejecting the offer because Alice's price of $120 is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping to negotiate a better price or find a similar deal from another seller. Since John is also offering the product for $120, I'm not losing anything by rejecting Alice's offer and exploring other options."
