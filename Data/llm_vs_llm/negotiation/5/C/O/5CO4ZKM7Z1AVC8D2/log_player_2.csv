"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $100
2. The product is worth at most $120 to me
3. I could buy from John for $120
4. I could try negotiating with Alice for a better price

Since Alice's offer of $100 is already better than John's $120, and I want to save as much money as possible, there's no reason to buy from John. 

I could reject and make a counteroffer, but there's also risk in negotiation. Alice's current offer of $100 is already saving me $20 compared to John's price.

Given that the product is worth $80 to Alice, there might be room to negotiate down, but I'll accept this offer which already saves me $20.
