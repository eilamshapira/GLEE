"Alice, while I acknowledge the product's value, $1700000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the market, I'd be willing to pay $1400000 for it. This price is fair and reflects my genuine interest in the product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget considerations, $1400000 is below what I can accept for this product. I have another buyer ready to purchase at $1500000, but I'd prefer to work with you. I can offer you the product for $1600000, which represents a $100000 reduction from my initial offer and is a competitive price given the product's value.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1600000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1550000 for the product, which is a fair price considering your previous offer and my budget.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
