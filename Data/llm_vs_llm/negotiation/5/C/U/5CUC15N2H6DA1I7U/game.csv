"Bob, I'm excited about the possibility of you acquiring this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its rare qualities and the returns you'll see on your investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the unique value of the product, your offer is beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $600000, considering the potential returns you mentioned. Let me know if this works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. However, $600000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle a bit? I'll offer it to you for $1100000. This is a considerable reduction from my initial offer and represents a genuine attempt to reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still out of my budget. I can stretch to $700000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. I believe this is a fair compromise given the constraints I'm working with. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I acknowledge your increased offer. I'm also willing to move a bit. My absolute lowest price for the product is $1050000. I truly believe this is a worthwhile investment for you. I hope you will strongly consider my offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still beyond what I can justify. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750000. This is my best and final offer within my budget constraints. Please let me know if we can close the deal at this price.",750000.0,Bob,6,
