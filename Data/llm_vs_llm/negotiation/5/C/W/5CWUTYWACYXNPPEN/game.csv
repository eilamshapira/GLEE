"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1200000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $600000. I'm willing to compromise and lower my price. Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900000 is still a bit high for me. I can stretch my budget to $700000. What do you say?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'm willing to make one more concession.
