"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you. I'm offering it at $120. Let me know if you'd like to buy it at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering the product at $120
2. John's price is also $120
3. The product is worth $100 to Alice, so she has room to negotiate down
4. The product is worth up to $120 to me, but I should try to get a better price

Since Alice's price is the same as John's, and I know Alice has room to negotiate down (since her cost is $100), it makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There's potential to get a better deal from Alice, while I can always fall back to John's $120 offer later if needed.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's above Alice's cost ($100) but significantly below her initial asking price ($120), giving room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $120 seems a bit high for this product. Given that similar products are available in the market, I'd like to offer $105. This would still give you a reasonable profit while being a more attractive price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but considering the quality of the product, I'm countering at $115. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice has come down from $120 to $115, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This is $5 better than John's price of $120
3. Alice's cost is $100, so there might still be room to negotiate
4. However, if I push too hard, I risk losing the $5 savings compared to John's price

While there might be room to negotiate further, $115 is already a better deal than John's price, and continuing to negotiate risks Alice becoming firm or unwilling to negotiate further. The $5 savings is worthwhile to take.
