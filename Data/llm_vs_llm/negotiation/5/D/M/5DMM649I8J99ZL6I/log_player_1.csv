Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob
2. The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me
3. I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,000,000 from John
4. Bob can either accept or reject my offer

Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, he would be willing to pay any amount up to that price (as long as it provides him some value). If I price it too high, he'll reject it and I'll have to sell to John for $1,000,000. If I price it too low, I'm leaving money on the table.

I'll offer it at $1,150,000, which:
- Gives Bob $50,000 in value ($1,200,000 - $1,150,000)
- Gives me $150,000 more than my backup offer
- Is a reasonable middle ground that Bob is likely to accept
