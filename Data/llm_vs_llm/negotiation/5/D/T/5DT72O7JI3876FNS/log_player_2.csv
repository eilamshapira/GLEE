"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you a premium product that I believe will greatly benefit you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $17500. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $17,500, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $10,000.
