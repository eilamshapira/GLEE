"Bob, I'm excited to finally offer you this incredible opportunity. This product is truly unique and I believe it will be a game-changer for you. Given its exceptional qualities and potential value, I'm starting the conversation at $2500000. I'm confident that once you see its full capabilities, you'll agree it's worth every penny.",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $2500000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to consider the product at $800000, which is my maximum limit.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, given my need for the product and your desire to sell it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is far below what I can accept. While I'm willing to negotiate, I also have another buyer, John, ready to purchase for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to work with you. Let's meet in the middle. How about $2200000?",2200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2200000 is still a significant stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1200000.  I'm sure you can see that we're getting closer, and this price is closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1200000. I'm also willing to come down a bit. Given that John is offering $1500000 and I value our potential business relationship, let's try to make this work. How about $1800000?",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1800000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1400000. This feels like a fair price considering your other offer and my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, since we are so close, I'm willing to come down a little further. My absolute minimum is $1600000. That's the lowest I can go.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me in the middle.  However, $1600000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1500000.  This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the other offers and our desire to close this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,8,
