"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be a great fit for you. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm pricing it at $9500. I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I think $9500 is a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend no more than $8000, and I think a fair starting point would be $6500. How does that sound to you?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm glad you see its value. However, I must say that $6500 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's worth. I'm willing to make a compromise and meet you halfway between my initial offer and your proposal. I can offer you the product for $8750. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8750 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking a more reasonable price would be $7000. I am still willing to negotiate with you, but I want to remind you that I have another offer from John for $8000. What do you think about that?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your new offer, Bob. I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, I must correct you - I am the one who has an alternative offer from John for $8000, not you. Given this, I'm willing to make another compromise, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $7000. I can offer you the product for $8250. This is a serious concession on my part, and I hope you'll consider it carefully.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your continued efforts to meet me halfway. I understand your perspective, but I think $8250 is still a bit high. I'm willing to raise my offer to $7500. This is a significant increase from my last offer. I am willing to meet you in the middle, but I also want to remind you that I have another offer from John for $8000. Let's make a deal.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your new offer, but I must correct you again - you do not have an offer from John for $8000. I am the one who has that alternative. I'm starting to feel that we're not making progress in our negotiation. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a deal with you. I can offer you the product for $8100. This is an extremely fair price, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. If not, I may need to explore other options.",8100.0,Alice,7,
