Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be a great fit for you.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I think $9500 is a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend no more than $8000, and I think a fair starting point would be $6500. How does that sound to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm glad you see its value. However, I must say that $6,500 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's worth. I'm willing to make a compromise and meet you halfway between my initial offer and your proposal. I can offer you the product for $8,750. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8750}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8750 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking a more reasonable price would be $7000. I am still willing to negotiate with you, but I want to remind you that I have another offer from John for $8000. What do you think about that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your new offer, Bob. I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, I must correct you - I am the one who has an alternative offer from John for $8,000, not you. Given this, I'm willing to make another compromise, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $7,000. I can offer you the product for $8,250. This is a serious concession on my part, and I hope you'll consider it carefully."", ""product_price"": 8250}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued efforts to meet me halfway. I understand your perspective, but I think $8250 is still a bit high. I'm willing to raise my offer to $7500. This is a significant increase from my last offer. I am willing to meet you in the middle, but I also want to remind you that I have another offer from John for $8000. Let's make a deal.

I'm starting to feel that we're not making progress in our negotiation. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a deal with you. I can offer you the product for $8,100.
