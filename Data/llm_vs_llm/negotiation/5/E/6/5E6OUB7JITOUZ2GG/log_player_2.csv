# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I think $9500 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle for $6500 instead? I believe this price point aligns better with my budget and the product's market value."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm glad you see its value. However, I must say that $6500 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's worth. I'm willing to make a compromise and meet you halfway between my initial offer and your proposal. I can offer you the product for $8750. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8750 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking a more reasonable price would be $7000. What do you think about that?"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your new offer, Bob. I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, I must correct you - I am the one who has an alternative offer from John for $8000, not you. Given this, I'm willing to make another compromise, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $7000. I can offer you the product for $8250. This is a serious concession on my part, and I hope you'll consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your new offer, but I must correct you again - you do not have an offer from John for $8000. I am the one who has that alternative. I'm starting to feel that we're not making progress in our negotiation. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a deal with you. I can offer you the product for $8100.
