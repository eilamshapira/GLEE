"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers.  A counteroffer is necessary to see if you can get a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 750000}

This counter-offer is 50% of Alice's initial asking price.  It significantly undercuts Alice's offer while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed. This strategy allows me to gauge Alice's bottom line and determine her willingness to negotiate within a reasonable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is getting closer to John's price, it's still worthwhile to try and negotiate a bit further. There's a good chance Alice might be willing to go a little lower, saving me a significant amount compared to simply accepting her current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

This offer splits the difference between her current offer ($1,250,000) and my previous offer ($750,000).  It shows willingness to move towards her price, but also sets a firm limit below John's offer."
