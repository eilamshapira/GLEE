Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my options carefully. The product is worth at least $12,000 to me, and I already have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price. Meanwhile, the product is only worth $10,000 to Bob, so he won't rationally pay more than that.

Given that Bob's maximum valuation ($10,000) is less than my minimum acceptable value ($12,000), there doesn't appear to be a zone of possible agreement. It would be most logical to sell directly to John for $12,000, but I'll start by offering Bob a price at my minimum value to see if he might accept.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

You have three options:
