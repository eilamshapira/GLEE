"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price offered by Alice ($12,000) is above my maximum value ($10,000) and higher than John's offer ($10,000). It would be rational to reject this offer and make a counteroffer to Alice, as there's potential to negotiate a better price. If Alice doesn't agree to a lower price, I can always buy from John at $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9000}

I'll offer $9,000 to Alice. This is a strategic counteroffer because:
1. It's below John's price of $10,000, giving me potential savings
2. It's above Alice's cost ($8,000), so there's still room for profit for her
3. If Alice rejects this offer, I can still negotiate up or ultimately go to John's offer of $10,000
4. Starting lower gives room for negotiation upward if needed"
