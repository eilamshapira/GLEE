"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You know you can get the product from John for $150. So, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer at the same price.  You can try to negotiate with Alice or see if she'll lower her price."
