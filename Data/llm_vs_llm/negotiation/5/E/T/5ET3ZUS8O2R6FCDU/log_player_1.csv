"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $80 is lower than my minimum price of $100 and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

My counteroffer is: $120

So, the response is not one of the three options you specified, but rather a counteroffer. To fit your format, I'll say:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer of $90 is still lower than what I can get from John, but it's getting closer. I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price from Bob.

My counteroffer is: $110

So, I'll reject Bob's offer and send a new counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Next round, I'll send the counteroffer: {""product_price"": 110}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 110}"
