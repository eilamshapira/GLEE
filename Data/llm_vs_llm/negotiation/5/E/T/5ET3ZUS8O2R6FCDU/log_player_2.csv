"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $150 is clearly above both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). There's no reason to accept this offer when I can either negotiate for a better price or buy from John. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}

I'll offer $80, which is below both Alice's cost ($100) and John's price ($100). This gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's price. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground that's still below $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $120 is still above both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). There's no reason to accept this offer. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round. If we can't reach a deal below $100, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

I'll increase my offer to $90, which is still below John's price but closer to Alice's cost. This shows I'm willing to negotiate upward while still maintaining an advantageous price for myself. If Alice refuses, I still have the option to go with John's $100 offer, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Alice's offers have consistently remained above $100, which is both my maximum value and John's selling price. While we could continue negotiating, Alice seems unwilling to go below $110, and I have a guaranteed option to buy at $100. It's the rational choice to take John's offer rather than continue negotiations that may not lead to a better price."
