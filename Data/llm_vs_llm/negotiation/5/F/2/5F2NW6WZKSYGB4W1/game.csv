"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you today. Given its features and value, I'm pricing it at $15000.

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand budget considerations, but I can't go as low as $10000 given the product's value. I could come down to $14000, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. This product is of premium quality and represents a strong value even at this price point. Would this work for you?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $14000 is still above what I'm prepared to spend. I can go up to $11000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget constraints. Let me know if you can meet me at this price.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $11000. I can see you're interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of its value. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle at $13000, which represents a $2000 reduction from my last offer. This is quite competitive for a product of this quality. Would this price work for you?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11500. This is my final offer before considering other options. Please let me know if this works for you.",11500.0,Bob,6,
