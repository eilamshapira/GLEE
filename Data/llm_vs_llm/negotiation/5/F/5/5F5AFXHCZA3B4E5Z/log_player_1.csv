I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to get closer to the product's value to him. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. This is still below the $1,200,000 it's worth to Bob, but higher than his initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but also aware of the product's value."

I've decided to accept Bob's offer of $950,000. Although it's still below the $1,200,000 the product is worth to him, it's significantly higher than the $800,000 I can get from John, and we've negotiated to a point where Bob has stated this is his highest offer. Accepting this offer ensures I earn a substantial amount for the product, and it concludes the negotiation on a mutually agreeable term."
