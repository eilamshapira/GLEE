"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $112.50?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth that price.",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $112.50 is still above what I'm looking to spend. How about we meet at $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $100.  It's still a good deal for you and a reasonable price for me. Let's try to make this work.",100.0,Alice,5,
