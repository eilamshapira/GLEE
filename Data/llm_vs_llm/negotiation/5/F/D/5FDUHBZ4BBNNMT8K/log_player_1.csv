"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product I think you'd be really interested in. Considering its value, I'm offering it to you for:"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I think $200 is too high. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, Bob's counteroffer is too low. I need to aim higher than $100. I can still sell to John for $120, but I think I can get a better price from Bob if I negotiate.

Therefore:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for:"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $150 is still too high for me. I can offer $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","This is a tough spot. Bob is offering $120, which is the same as what John is offering. I need to consider whether I can realistically get a better price from Bob in the remaining rounds. I also have to consider that I might not get a higher offer.

Since I can sell the product to John for $120, and I don't want to risk not selling the product at all, and since there are many rounds left, I should accept Bob's offer.
