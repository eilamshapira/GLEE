"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm looking forward to your response.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but I must decline as $700000 is below what I can accept. The product has significant value, and my minimum acceptable price is $800000, which is actually what I've been offered by another buyer. However, I'd prefer to work with you, so I'm willing to come down to $900000, which still represents excellent value given that this product is worth $1000000 in the right hands. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you have another buyer willing to pay $800000, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still not comfortable with $900000. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $850000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price. If not, I may need to explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,
