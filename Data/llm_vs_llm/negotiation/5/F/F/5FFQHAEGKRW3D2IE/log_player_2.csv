"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but I must decline as $700000 is below what I can accept. The product has significant value, and my minimum acceptable price is $800000, which is actually what I've been offered by another buyer. However, I'd prefer to work with you, so I'm willing to come down to $900000, which still represents excellent value given that this product is worth $1000000 in the right hands. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.
