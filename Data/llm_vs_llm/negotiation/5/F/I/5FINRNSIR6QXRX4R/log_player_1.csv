Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.
