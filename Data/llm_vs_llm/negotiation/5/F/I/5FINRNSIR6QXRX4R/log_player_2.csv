"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a firm price of $1200000. Please let me know if you are interested in proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice's initial offer is $1,200,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and closer to my budget. Since I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, I'll make an offer that is significantly lower, but still shows that I'm interested in buying the product.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
