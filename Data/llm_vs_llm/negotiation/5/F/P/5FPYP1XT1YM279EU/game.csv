"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in your product but $3000000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $1500000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm placing on this product. I'm open to discussing further if needed.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1500000. I understand that $3000000 might be out of your range, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering your budget and the value you're placing on the product, I'm willing to make a compromise. However, $1500000 is the lowest price I can consider, and I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'd like to propose a price of $2250000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still reflects the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",2250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $2250000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not able to go that high. I'm willing to offer $1800000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product and our previous discussions.",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $1800000. I appreciate the increase and your continued interest in the product. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. Considering your latest offer, I'm willing to compromise further. I'd like to propose a price of $2000000. This is a significant reduction from my previous counteroffer and reflects my willingness to find a middle ground. I believe this price better represents the product's value and is a fair compromise given our discussions.",2000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to find a middle ground.  While $2000000 is closer to my goal, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to offer $1900000.  I believe this represents a fair compromise given our previous discussions and my commitment to acquiring this product.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",1900000.0,Bob,6,
