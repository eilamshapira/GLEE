Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1500000. I understand that $3000000 might be out of your range, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering your budget and the value you're placing on the product, I'm willing to make a compromise. However, $1500000 is the lowest price I can consider, and I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'd like to propose a price of $2250000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still reflects the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.

# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $1800000. I appreciate the increase and your continued interest in the product. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. Considering your latest offer, I'm willing to compromise further. I'd like to propose a price of $2000000.
