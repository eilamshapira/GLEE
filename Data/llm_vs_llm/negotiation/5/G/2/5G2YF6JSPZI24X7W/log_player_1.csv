Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Given its rarity and high demand, I believe it's worth a premium price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which I think is a fair value considering its unique features and benefits. Let me know if you're interested or if you'd like to make a counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $800000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let me know if this works for you or if you have another price in mind. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer is equal to the price I can get from John, and I believe the product is worth more, I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price from Bob. My next counteroffer will be lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer.
