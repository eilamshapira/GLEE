"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. $20000 is beyond my budget. I value this product at around $4000. Would you be open to negotiating at that price?",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, but I must say that $4000 is quite far from the product's true value. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $17000, which is still a significant reduction from my initial price.",17000.0,Alice,3,
