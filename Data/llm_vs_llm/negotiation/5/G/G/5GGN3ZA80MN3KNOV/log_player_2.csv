"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product, valued at $1000000, represents an exceptional investment. Given its market value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1200000. This price reflects the product's true worth and immediate availability. I have another interested buyer, but I'm extending this offer to you first. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Looking at the situation:

1. The product is worth at most $1,000,000 to me.
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $1,200,000.
3. John will sell me the same product for $1,000,000.

Alice's offer would mean I'm paying $200,000 more than the product is worth to me. There's no reason to accept this when I can get the same product from John at its actual value.
