"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to consider this carefully. Looking at the given information:

- Alice is offering the product for $12,000
- The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy the same product from John for $12,000

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price of $12,000, and this matches the maximum value of the product to me, I'm indifferent between the two options. There's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other.
