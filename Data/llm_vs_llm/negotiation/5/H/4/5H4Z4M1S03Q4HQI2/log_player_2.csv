It's better to try and negotiate with Alice.  We know the product is worth less to her than the asking price, so there's room for a deal.  Let's see if we can get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still above what the product is worth to her. Hopefully, this will encourage her to negotiate further."

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $950,000.  This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm still not willing to pay her full asking price."

We're getting closer!  Let's try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal."
