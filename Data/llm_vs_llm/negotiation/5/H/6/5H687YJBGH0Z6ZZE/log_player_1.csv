"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start by making a relatively high offer to maximize my potential earnings. I can always adjust my price later based on Bob's response.

{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($8,000), but I still don't know the maximum price Bob is willing to pay, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

My counteroffer will be slightly lower than my initial offer, to show that I'm willing to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob was willing to pay $10,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. This will give me a chance to negotiate a better price while also showing that I'm willing to compromise.

{""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's new offer of $10,500 is higher than his previous offer, which suggests that he's interested in the product and willing to pay a premium for it. Since $10,500 is a good price, but I still think I can get a better deal, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer.

However, I'll make a smaller adjustment this time, to see if I can get Bob to meet me at a higher price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's last offer was $10,500, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than his offer, but not excessively so. I'll aim for a price that's still within the realm of possibility for Bob, while also trying to maximize my earnings.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's new offer of $11,000 is a significant increase from his previous offers, and it's a very good price. At this point, I'm inclined to accept his offer, as it's likely that I won't be able to get a much better price from him. Additionally, selling to John for $8,000 is no longer an attractive option, given Bob's higher offer.
