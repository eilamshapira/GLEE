"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower. Would you consider $7000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $18000 might be out of your budget, but $7000 is below what I'm comfortable selling the product for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $12000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm trying to be flexible, but I also need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $10500, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going. If this works for you, I think we can finalize the sale.",10500.0,Alice,5,
