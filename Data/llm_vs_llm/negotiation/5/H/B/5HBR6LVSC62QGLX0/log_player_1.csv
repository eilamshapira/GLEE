Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower. Would you consider $7000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price. My counteroffer will be $12,000. This price is still below my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer, giving us room for further negotiation if needed. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 might be out of your budget, but $7,000 is below what I'm comfortable selling the product for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.""}"

Bob's offer:

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since Bob's maximum budget is $9,000 and I'm trying to get as close to my target as possible without going below $15,000, I'll try to meet him closer to his budget while still being mindful of my own minimum.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm trying to be flexible, but I also need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $10,500, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going. If this works for you, I think we can finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
