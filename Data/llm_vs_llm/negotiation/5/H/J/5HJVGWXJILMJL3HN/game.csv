"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",8000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,Bob's offer is too low.
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me to accept. However, considering our interest in the product, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $18000?",18000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your original price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,,
