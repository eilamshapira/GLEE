Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this amazing product. Considering its value and the unique features it offers, I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me to accept. However, considering our interest in the product, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $18000 is still a bit out of my budget.

I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.
