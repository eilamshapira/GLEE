"Hi Bob, I have a great product for you. I know that this product is worth $100 to you, so I'm offering it at $95. This gives you a $5 benefit while also allowing me to earn more than my minimum acceptable price. It's a fair deal where we both win. Would you like to purchase the product at this price?",95.0,Alice,1,
