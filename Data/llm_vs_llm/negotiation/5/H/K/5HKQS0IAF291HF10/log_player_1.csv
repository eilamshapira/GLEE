Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price point that is significantly lower. Given my budget constraints, I would like to offer $600000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and even lower than the guaranteed sale price to John, I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $600,000 is below my expectations.

I believe this is a more reasonable price point, and I'm open to further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. However, I need to manage my budget effectively. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000. This price point aligns better with my current financial situation, and I hope we can reach an agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $700,000 is still lower than the guaranteed sale price to John, I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob, but if the negotiation doesn't improve, I can always fall back on selling to John for $800,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for increasing your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to make another concession and lower the price to $950,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $800,000 matches the guaranteed sale price to John, I will accept the offer. There's no benefit in continuing the negotiation, as I've already achieved the minimum price I was willing to accept. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at the desired price, and I can conclude the negotiation."
