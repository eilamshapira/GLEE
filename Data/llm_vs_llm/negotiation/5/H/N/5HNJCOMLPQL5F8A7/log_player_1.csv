"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, this is a tricky situation. Bob's offer is quite low. I need to consider my options carefully.

Considering the potential profit:
*   Selling to Bob for $80: Profit is $80 - $150 = -$70
*   Selling to John for $150: Profit is $150 - $150 = $0

Since I have 8 rounds left and the product is worth $100 to Bob, it is possible to negotiate the price higher.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, this is still not a great offer. But the pressure is building. Let's analyze the current situation:

*   Selling to Bob for $90: Profit is $90 - $150 = -$60
*   Selling to John for $150: Profit is $150 - $150 = $0

I still have 6 rounds left. Bob is offering a price lower than the product's worth to me, so it is possible to negotiate the price higher.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, let's try this:
