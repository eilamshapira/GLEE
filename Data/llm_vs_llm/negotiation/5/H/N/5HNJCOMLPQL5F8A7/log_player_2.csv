(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","$200 is well above my budget limit of $100, so I won't accept this offer. I could buy from John immediately for $100, but I'll try negotiating with Alice first to see if we can reach a better deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has lowered her price, but $180 is still significantly above my limit of $100. Since the product is only worth $100 to me, and John is offering it for exactly $100, I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's option.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice is gradually lowering her price, but $170 is still well above my $100 maximum value for the product. Since I can buy the same product from John for $100, and Alice is still far from this price point after several rounds of negotiation, it makes the most economic sense to buy from John.
