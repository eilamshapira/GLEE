"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an outstanding product available. Considering its quality and value, I’m offering it to you for $140. If this works for you, please let me know—if not, I’ll be selling it to another buyer for $120. I hope we can make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the product is available from John for $100, and Alice's offer of $140 is above my budget of $100, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John instead.
