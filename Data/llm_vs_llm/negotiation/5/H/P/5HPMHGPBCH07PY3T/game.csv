"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested but $18000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12000, which is the maximum I can afford at this time.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget, but I believe the product is truly worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $15000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm firm on my offer of $12000.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is firm at $12000.  If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to unfortunately look elsewhere.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I see your firm budget, and I appreciate you sticking to it. Since I'm keen on closing the deal with you, and considering the value you'll gain from the product, I'm willing to make a final offer of $13000. This is as low as I can go.",13000.0,Alice,7,
