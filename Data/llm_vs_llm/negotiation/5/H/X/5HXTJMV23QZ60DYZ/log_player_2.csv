"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you my product. I would like to offer it to you for $1350000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $1,350,000 is higher than the value I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000 is the value to Alice, so I'm hoping to get it for less), and it's still below my maximum budget of $1,500,000, I'll choose to reject the offer and make a counteroffer to try and get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I don't know how flexible Alice is with her price, I'll start with a somewhat aggressive offer to see how she responds.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I cannot accept your offer of $1000000, I would be willing to sell you the product for $1275000. How does that sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,275,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with. Since I know that Alice values the product at $1,200,000, I'm hoping to get it for somewhere around that price or slightly higher.

I'll choose to reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer, trying to split the difference between my previous offer and Alice's new offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a new counteroffer that is higher than my previous offer of $1,000,000, but still lower than Alice's current offer of $1,275,000. I'll try to meet Alice halfway and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still very interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $1,187,500?"", ""product_price"": 1187500}"
