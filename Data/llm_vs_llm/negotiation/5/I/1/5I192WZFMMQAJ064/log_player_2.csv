"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1200000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value. Would you be interested in making this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to make a decision that maximizes my value. Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is $400,000 more than what the product is worth to me (which is a maximum of $800,000). John is willing to sell the exact same product for $800,000, which is exactly my maximum value.

Since Alice's initial offer exceeds my maximum value, and John's offer is exactly at my maximum value, the rational choice is to simply buy from John.
