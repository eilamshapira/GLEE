"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to consider the offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $150, which is more than the $100 it's worth to me. I also have the option to buy from John for $100, which guarantees I get the product at my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's initial offer is above my valuation, and I have a guaranteed option at $100, the rational choice is to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This gives me a chance to negotiate a better price than John's $100.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives room for negotiation but is less than John's price.
