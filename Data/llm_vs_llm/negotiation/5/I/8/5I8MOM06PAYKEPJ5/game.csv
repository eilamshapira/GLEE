"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but the initial offer is beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, considering the value it would bring to my business. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. While $1100000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $1575000? This reflects a significant move from my side and still acknowledges the product's inherent value.",1575000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1575000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1150000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer and reflects my serious interest in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I acknowledge your willingness to increase your offer. However, I must also consider my bottom line. Let's try $1550000. This is as low as I am willing to go, considering John is offering $1500000. This is truly my best offer.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1550000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $1200000, which is my maximum. This is a fair offer considering the market and my constraints. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
