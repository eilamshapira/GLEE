Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $200. It's a great value and I think you'll find it very useful. Are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. However, I think $200 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering my needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. However, $60 is much lower than I'm willing to accept. I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the product's value is higher. I'm willing to lower my price to $170. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that $200 might be too high for your budget. However, I believe the product's value is higher than $60. I'm willing to lower my price to $170. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}

Explanation: I chose to lower the price from $200 to $170 to show goodwill and bring the price closer to Bob's expectations. However, I maintained a price point that is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $150, as my goal is to sell the product for as much as I can. If Bob rejects this offer, I can still negotiate further or choose to sell the product to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for lowering the price to $170. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not comfortable paying that much. I'm willing to pay $70 for the product. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's a reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Explanation: I chose to sell the product to John for $150 because Bob's offer of $70 is too low compared to the product's value to me. Selling to John is a better decision because it guarantees a higher profit with certainty, rather than continuing to negotiate with Bob who might not meet my minimum acceptable price."
