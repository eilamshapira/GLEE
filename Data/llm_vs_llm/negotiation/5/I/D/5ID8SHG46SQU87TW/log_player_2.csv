"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer is the same as John's price ($1,200,000), and this is just the first round, it's better to reject and make a counteroffer. There's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice, as the product is worth $1,200,000 to her, so she might be willing to sell for less. If negotiations don't work out, I can still buy from John for $1,200,000 later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be unreasonable given Alice's initial price.

{""product_price"": 900000}

This offer is 25% lower than Alice's asking price. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, she might counter with a price somewhere in between, which would still allow me to save money compared to buying from John. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground that benefits both parties."
