"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll really enjoy. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

- The product is worth no more than $120 to me (Bob)
- Alice is offering to sell it for $150
- John is willing to sell the same product for $120

Since Alice's offer ($150) exceeds both the maximum value I place on the product ($120) and John's alternative price ($120), it makes economic sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John instead.
