"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $700,000 is lower than the product's worth to me and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

My counteroffer is: $900,000

So, the response is not one of the three options you listed, but rather a counteroffer. However, to fit the format you requested:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $750,000 is still lower than what I can get from John, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

My counteroffer is: $850,000

So, the response is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I will send the counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $800,000 is the same as what I can get from John, and I've already negotiated for several rounds, I don't see a benefit in continuing to negotiate with Bob.
