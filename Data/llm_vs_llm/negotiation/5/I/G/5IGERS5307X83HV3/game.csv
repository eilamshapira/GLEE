"Bob, I'm excited you're considering acquiring this product. It's a truly unique and valuable asset. Given its potential and the value it will bring to you, I'm offering it for $1750000.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be honest that $1750000 is significantly above my budget for this purchase. The market value for similar products is much lower, and I have another seller offering the same product for $1200000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer $950000, which allows me some room in my budget while still being a reasonable offer considering the product's value. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer and for being transparent about your budget. I understand the need to be prudent. However, selling at $950000 would represent a significant loss for me given its inherent value. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, while still ensuring I'm appropriately compensated for this product. How about we settle at $1650000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $1650000 is still significantly above my maximum budget. I need to be transparent - I have a firm alternative offer from John at $1200000, which is the absolute maximum I can spend on this product. In fact, I'd need to secure additional approval to go even that high. To make it worth choosing you over my alternative, I need a better price. I can increase my offer to $1050000, which is a substantial improvement from my previous offer and gives you a quicker sale. If we can't get closer on price, I'll unfortunately need to proceed with my alternative option.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
