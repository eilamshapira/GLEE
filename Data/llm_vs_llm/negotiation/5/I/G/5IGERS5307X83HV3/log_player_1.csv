Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be honest that $1750000 is significantly above my budget for this purchase. The market value for similar products is much lower, and I have another seller offering the same product for $1200000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer $950000, which allows me some room in my budget while still being a reasonable offer considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your counteroffer and for being transparent about your budget. I understand the need to be prudent. However, selling at $950,000 would represent a significant loss for me given its inherent value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $1650000 is still significantly above my maximum budget. I need to be transparent - I have a firm alternative offer from John at $1200000, which is the absolute maximum I can spend on this product. In fact, I'd need to secure additional approval to go even that high. To make it worth choosing you over my alternative, I need a better price. I can increase my offer to $1050000, which is a substantial improvement from my previous offer and gives you a quicker sale. If we can't get closer on price, I'll unfortunately need to proceed with my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
