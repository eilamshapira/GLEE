"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Looking at the options, I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, reject it, or buy from John.

Alice is offering the product for $10,000, which is exactly the maximum I'm willing to pay. John is also offering the product for $10,000.

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($10,000), and this is my maximum budget, there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other. In this case, I might as well accept Alice's offer since she's the primary seller I'm dealing with.
