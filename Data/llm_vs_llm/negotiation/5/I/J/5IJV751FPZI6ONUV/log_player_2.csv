"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer is the same as John's price ($12,000), and I know the product is worth only $10,000 to Alice, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There's no risk in negotiating further since I can always buy from John at $12,000 later.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly above Alice's cost ($10,000) to make it somewhat attractive but still gives me good savings compared to the $12,000 alternative.

{""product_price"": 10,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has lowered her price from $12,000 to $11,750, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still quite high considering her cost is $10,000. Since I still have 7 more rounds of negotiation possible and can always fall back on John's offer, I'll reject this and try another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer slightly to show I'm willing to meet in the middle, but still maintain a good margin for savings.

{""product_price"": 10,800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has dropped her price significantly from $11,750 to $11,400, showing she's becoming more flexible. However, there's still room for negotiation since this is well above her cost of $10,000, and I still have 5 more rounds. I'll reject and counter again.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has shown willingness to move down in price significantly, I'll increase my offer more substantially to show good faith and try to meet at a middle ground.

{""product_price"": 11,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has come down to $11,200, which is getting closer to my last offer of $11,000. This is a good price compared to John's $12,000, saving me $800. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might become less flexible, and I only have 3 rounds left. This seems like a reasonable deal that gives both parties a fair margin.
