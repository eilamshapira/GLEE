Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

{""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Considering the options:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100:** This is below my minimum price of $150, so I won't do this.
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer:** This allows me to try for a better price.
*   **(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150:** This guarantees a profit, and is above my minimum.

I'll choose option (3) and sell to John, as it guarantees me $150.
