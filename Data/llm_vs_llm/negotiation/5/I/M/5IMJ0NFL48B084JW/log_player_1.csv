Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer, but leaving some room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","While $130 is above my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's still quite low considering Bob values the product at $150. I believe there's room for a better deal, so I'll reject and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still maintain a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","$135 is a reasonable offer - it's significantly better than John's $120 offer, and while we could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Bob getting frustrated and walking away. The difference between $135 and my last ask of $140 is relatively small. I'll accept this offer.
