"Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offer is $145
2. I know the product is worth $120 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation
3. John's price ($150) is my worst-case scenario
4. Since Alice's current offer ($145) is already better than John's price ($150), I could accept it
5. However, since I know Alice's cost ($120), I can try to negotiate for a better price
6. Even if negotiations fail, I can always go back to John or accept a later offer from Alice

Given this analysis, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. Alice has room to go lower since her cost is $120, and I have John's offer as a backup.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know Alice's cost is $120, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives her some profit while trying to get a better deal for myself. I'll offer $130, which gives Alice a $10 profit margin while saving me $20 compared to her initial offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has dropped her price from $145 to $140, showing willingness to negotiate
2. My counteroffer of $130 was rejected, but Alice came down $5
3. The gap between our positions has narrowed ($130 vs $140)
4. $140 is still better than John's price ($150)
5. However, since Alice's cost is $120, there might still be room for one more negotiation round
6. If I make another counteroffer, I risk Alice raising the price again

Given that Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by lowering her price, I'll try one more round of negotiation. The worst case is I can still accept a later offer or go to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to meet Alice closer to the middle between my last offer ($130) and her current offer ($140). I'll offer $135, which would still give her a reasonable $15 profit while getting me a better deal than her current offer.
