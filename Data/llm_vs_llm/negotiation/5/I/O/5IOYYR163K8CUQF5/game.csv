"Hi Bob, I'm offering a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm selling it for $140. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value in the market.",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. The market value for this product is actually closer to $110-120. I'd like to offer you $110 for it. This gives you a reasonable profit while helping me stay within my budget. What do you say?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I need to consider the true value of this product. It's worth substantially more than $110-120 in the current market. However, I'm willing to come down to $130 as a courtesy to you. This still represents a good value given the product's quality and market position.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, I've been researching similar products and I believe $130 is still above the fair market value. I can increase my offer to $120, which gives you a solid $20 profit from your cost of $100. This seems like a fair deal for both of us. How does that sound?",120.0,Bob,4,
