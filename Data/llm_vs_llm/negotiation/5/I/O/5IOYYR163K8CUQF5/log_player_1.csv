"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm selling it for $140. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value in the market."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. The market value for this product is actually closer to $110-120. I'd like to offer you $110 for it. This gives you a reasonable profit while helping me stay within my budget. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I need to consider the true value of this product. It's worth substantially more than $110-120 in the current market. However, I'm willing to come down to $130 as a courtesy to you. This still represents a good value given the product's quality and market position."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, I've been researching similar products and I believe $130 is still above the fair market value. I can increase my offer to $120, which gives you a solid $20 profit from your cost of $100. This seems like a fair deal for both of us. How does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
