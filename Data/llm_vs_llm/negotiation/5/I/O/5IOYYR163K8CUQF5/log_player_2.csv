"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm selling it for $140. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and value in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to analyze this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $140, which is below the $150 that John would charge me. However, I know the product is only worth $100 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.

I'll reject this offer since I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can likely get a better price. Even if negotiations fail, I can still buy from John at $150 as a fallback.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. The market value for this product is actually closer to $110-120. I'd like to offer you $110 for it. This gives you a reasonable profit while helping me stay within my budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I need to consider the true value of this product. It's worth substantially more than $110-120 in the current market. However, I'm willing to come down to $130 as a courtesy to you. This still represents a good value given the product's quality and market position. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has come down to $130 from her initial $140, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, I still believe there's room to get a better price considering the product is worth $100 to her. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating, as I still have plenty of rounds left.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, I've been researching similar products and I believe $130 is still above the fair market value. I can increase my offer to $120, which gives you a solid $20 profit from your cost of $100. This seems like a fair deal for both of us. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
