Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer that's closer to Bob's value of $120, but leaves some room for negotiation if needed.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob offered $90, which is better than John's $80, but still quite low considering Bob values the product at $120, I'll reject and make another counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still aim for a price that gives me a good profit, considering Bob values it at $120.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","$95 is a reasonable offer - it's significantly higher than John's $80 and represents a fair compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's valuation. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Bob walking away, leaving me with only John's $80 offer. I'll accept this offer.
