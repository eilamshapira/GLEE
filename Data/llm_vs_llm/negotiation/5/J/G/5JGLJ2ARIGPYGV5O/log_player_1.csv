Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to set a price that balances the potential for higher profit against the risk of rejection. Since I have a guaranteed fallback of $12,000 from John, I can be somewhat aggressive with my offer to Bob. I'll set a price significantly higher than my minimum, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected.
