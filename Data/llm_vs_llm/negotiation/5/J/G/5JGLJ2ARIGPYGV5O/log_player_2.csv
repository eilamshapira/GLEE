"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and I have the option to buy it from John for exactly $10,000, Alice's offer of $18,500 is not a good deal. It's significantly higher than both the product's worth to me and John's alternative price.
