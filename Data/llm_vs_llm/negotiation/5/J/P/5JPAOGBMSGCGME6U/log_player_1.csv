Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. 

Given that:
1. My minimum acceptable price is $80 (as I can sell to John for this amount)
2. I don't know Bob's maximum willingness to pay
3. I only have one chance to make an offer

I should set a price significantly above $80 to maximize my potential profit, while still keeping it at a reasonable level that Bob might accept. I'll aim for a 50% markup over my minimum price.
