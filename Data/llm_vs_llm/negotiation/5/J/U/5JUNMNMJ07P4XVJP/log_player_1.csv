Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $1500000 exceeds my budget and the value this product represents to me. I know the product is valued at $1000000 to you, and I have an alternative option to purchase from John at exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm prepared to offer you $800000, which would provide you with a quicker sale while allowing me some savings compared to my alternative option. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. While I understand you have budget considerations, I need to clarify a point - you mentioned having an alternative option to purchase from John at $1,000,000, but John is actually my alternative buyer, not yours. I've carefully considered your offer of $800,000, but I cannot accept less than the product's minimum value to me. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer to $1,100,000, which provides you with significant savings from my original price while still reflecting the true value of the product. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I think there might be some confusion. John is actually another seller who has offered to sell me the same product for $1000000, not a buyer as you mentioned. While I appreciate you lowering your initial offer, $1100000 is still more than what I can get from John. Since the product is worth $1000000 to you according to my information, and I can purchase it elsewhere at that exact price, I'd need you to meet or beat that price for us to do business. I'm willing to offer you $950000, which would save me money compared to John's offer while still giving you a reasonable return. Would this work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for clarifying the situation. I understand now that John is another seller offering you the same product at $1,000,000. However, I need to be transparent that in my case, John is actually a buyer who has offered to purchase my product for $1,000,000 guaranteed. This means that I have a firm alternative at that price point. While I appreciate your offer of $950,000, accepting it would mean I'd be losing $50,000 compared to my alternative with John. Since we both want to make this deal work, I can offer you the product at $1,000,000 - the same price you'd pay John, but perhaps with better terms or service from me. This price represents my absolute minimum, as anything less would not be economically viable for me given my alternative."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
