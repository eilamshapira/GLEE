"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'm offering to you. It's a unique opportunity that I believe would be beneficial for you. I'm valuing this product at $1500000, which I think is fair considering its market value and potential. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's asking for $1,500,000 for a product that is worth at most $1,000,000 to me. Since John is willing to sell me the same product for $1,000,000, and that's the maximum value of the product to me, Alice's offer doesn't make financial sense.

I know the product is valued at $1,000,000 to you, and I have an alternative option to purchase from John at exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. While I understand you have budget considerations, I need to clarify a point - you mentioned having an alternative option to purchase from John at $1000000, but John is actually my alternative buyer, not yours. I've carefully considered your offer of $800000, but I cannot accept less than the product's minimum value to me. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer to $1100000, which provides you with significant savings from my original price while still reflecting the true value of the product. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","It seems there's been a misunderstanding. Alice believes John is her alternative buyer, but according to my instructions, John is actually another seller who is willing to sell me the same product for $1,000,000.

Alice has reduced her price to $1,100,000, but this is still $100,000 more than what John is offering. Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and I can get it from John at exactly that price, Alice's current offer doesn't make financial sense.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I think there might be some confusion. John is actually another seller who has offered to sell me the same product for $1,000,000, not a buyer as you mentioned. While I appreciate you lowering your initial offer, $1,100,000 is still more than what I can get from John. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to you according to my information, and I can purchase it elsewhere at that exact price, I'd need you to meet or beat that price for us to do business. I'm willing to offer you $950,000, which would save me money compared to John's offer while still giving you a reasonable return. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for clarifying the situation. I understand now that John is another seller offering you the same product at $1000000. However, I need to be transparent that in my case, John is actually a buyer who has offered to purchase my product for $1000000 guaranteed. This means that I have a firm alternative at that price point. While I appreciate your offer of $950000, accepting it would mean I'd be losing $50000 compared to my alternative with John. Since we both want to make this deal work, I can offer you the product at $1000000 - the same price you'd pay John, but perhaps with better terms or service from me. This price represents my absolute minimum, as anything less would not be economically viable for me given my alternative.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has now matched John's price of $1,000,000. Since both options are now at the same price, and Alice suggests she might offer better terms or service, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer rather than going to John.
