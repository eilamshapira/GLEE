"Hi Bob, I hope you're doing well. I'm offering you a valuable product that I believe would be a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, which represents its fair market value. This is the same price that my other potential buyer, John, has already agreed to pay. I wanted to give you the first opportunity to purchase it at this price before finalizing the deal with John. Would you like to proceed with this purchase?",10000.0,Alice,1,
