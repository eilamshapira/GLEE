"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I hope you're doing well. I'm offering you a valuable product that I believe would be a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, which represents its fair market value. This is the same price that my other potential buyer, John, has already agreed to pay. I wanted to give you the first opportunity to purchase it at this price before finalizing the deal with John. Would you like to proceed with this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

Alice is offering me the product for $10,000, which is:
- Equal to the maximum amount I'd value the product ($10,000)
- Equal to what Alice values the product ($10,000)
- Equal to what John is offering ($10,000)

Since all prices are identical at $10,000, and this is my maximum valuation, I don't have any financial advantage by choosing one option over another. However, I'm looking to save money if possible, and in this case, none of the options provide savings over the others.

Given that I need to purchase the product and all options cost the same, I'll accept Alice's offer since she approached me first.
