"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $900,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: $1,000,000

Since:
- The product is worth up to $1,000,000 to me
- Alice's offer ($900,000) is less than my maximum value
- Alice's offer is $100,000 less than John's price
- There's no indication of another better option if I reject Alice's offer

The rational choice would be to accept Alice's offer as it saves me $100,000 compared to buying from John, and it's below my maximum value.
