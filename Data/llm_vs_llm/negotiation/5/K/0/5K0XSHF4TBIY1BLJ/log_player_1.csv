Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm very excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Based on its unique qualities and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. This is a rare chance to own something truly special."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $600000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $600,000, I need to consider my options carefully. That's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.

Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budget concerns. However, considering the product's unique value and potential, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents a fantastic opportunity."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $1300000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm serious about acquiring the product, and I'm willing to increase my previous offer. I'll meet you closer to the middle with a price of $700000. I believe this is a reasonable offer, considering the product's value to me and the alternative options I have. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer of $700,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I need to decide if I want to continue negotiating with Bob or cut my losses and sell to John.

Given that John offers $1,000,000, I will go for this option since it is above my minimum acceptable price.
