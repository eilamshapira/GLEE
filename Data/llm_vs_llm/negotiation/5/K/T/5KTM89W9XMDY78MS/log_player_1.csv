Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but $160 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. The product is worth no more than $80 to me based on my needs and budget. I'd like to offer $60 for it. This allows you to make a sale today while giving me some room in my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but $60 is too low for me as the product costs me no less than $120. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to at least cover my costs. I can offer you the product for $130, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. However, you should know that I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at $120. I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a fair price."", ""product_price"": 130}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price to $130. I understand you mentioned the product costs you $120, but I need to be frank - the product is only worth $80 to me based on my needs and budget constraints. In fact, I can purchase the same product from another seller for exactly $80. I'd like to offer you $75, which would give you a quick sale today. This is my best offer considering my alternatives. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
