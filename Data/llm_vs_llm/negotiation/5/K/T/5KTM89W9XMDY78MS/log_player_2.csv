"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well. I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its features and value, I'm offering it at $160. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I see that Alice is offering the product for $160, which exceeds the maximum value of $80 that it's worth to me. John is willing to sell the same product for $80, which is exactly at my maximum value. However, I'll try negotiating with Alice first to see if I can get a better deal before going to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but $160 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. The product is worth no more than $80 to me based on my needs and budget. I'd like to offer $60 for it. This allows you to make a sale today while giving me some room in my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but $60 is too low for me as the product costs me no less than $120. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to at least cover my costs. I can offer you the product for $130, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. However, you should know that I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at $120. I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has reduced her price to $130, but this is still well above my maximum value of $80. She's mentioned that the product costs her $120, which matches the information I was given. She's also mentioned another buyer named John who would pay $120, but I know I can buy from John for $80 at any time.

Since Alice's current offer exceeds my maximum value and John's price of $80 is exactly at my maximum value threshold, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price to $130. I understand you mentioned the product costs you $120, but I need to be frank - the product is only worth $80 to me based on my needs and budget constraints. In fact, I can purchase the same product from another seller for exactly $80. I'd like to offer you $75, which would give you a quick sale today. This is my best offer considering my alternatives."", ""product_price"": 75}"
