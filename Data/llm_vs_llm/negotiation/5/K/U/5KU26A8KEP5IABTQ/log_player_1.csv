Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob is offering $80, which is the same price that John is willing to pay, and we don't know if Bob would accept a higher counteroffer, it makes sense to reject this offer and make a counter-offer. We might be able to get a better price from Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $80 is lower than what I'm looking for. Given the quality and value of the product, I could go down to $100. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
