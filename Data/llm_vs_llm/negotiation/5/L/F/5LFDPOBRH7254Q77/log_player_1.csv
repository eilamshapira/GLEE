Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Considering my options:

*   **Accept Bob's offer (sell for $7,000):** This is not ideal, as it's below my minimum and I'd lose money.
*   **Reject Bob's offer and counter (continue negotiation):** This gives me a chance to get a better price from Bob.
*   **Sell to John ($10,000):** This guarantees a profit and is higher than Bob's current offer.

Since I want to maximize profit, I'll continue the negotiation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Okay, let's re-evaluate:

*   **Accept Bob's offer ($7,500):** Still below my minimum and not ideal.
*   **Reject Bob's offer and counter:** Could potentially get a better price, but it's a gamble.
*   **Sell to John ($10,000):** Guaranteed profit, and significantly better than what Bob is offering.

Given the persistent low offers from Bob, and the security of a good price from John, I will sell to John.
