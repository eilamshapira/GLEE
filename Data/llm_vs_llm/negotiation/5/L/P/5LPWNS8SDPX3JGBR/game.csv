"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my research and budget, I can offer $50 for it. This seems fair considering the market value.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $50 is too low for me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? I can offer the product to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $120 is still more than I can justify spending. I have another seller (John) who's offering the same product for $80. To make it worth buying from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $65 for it.",65.0,Bob,4,
