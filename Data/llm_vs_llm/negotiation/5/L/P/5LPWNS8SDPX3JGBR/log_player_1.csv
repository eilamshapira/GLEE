Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my research and budget, I can offer $50 for it. This seems fair considering the market value.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $120 is still more than I can justify spending. I have another seller (John) who's offering the same product for $80. To make it worth buying from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $65 for it.
