"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'm offering. Would you be interested in buying it for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer of $150 for the product. Since the product is only worth up to $80 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $80, Alice's offer of $150 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my research and budget, I can offer $50 for it. This seems fair considering the market value."", ""product_price"": 50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $50 is too low for me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? I can offer the product to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has lowered her price from $150 to $120, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $120 is still significantly higher than my maximum value of $80 for this product. Since John is offering the exact same product for $80, which matches my maximum valuation, Alice would need to beat that price for me to consider her offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $120 is still more than I can justify spending. I have another seller (John) who's offering the same product for $80. To make it worth buying from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $65 for it."", ""product_price"": 65}"
