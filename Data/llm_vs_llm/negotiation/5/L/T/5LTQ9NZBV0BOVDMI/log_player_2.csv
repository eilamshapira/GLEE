"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice is offering the product at $1,500,000, which is exactly the same price that John is offering and also equal to my maximum valuation, I don't gain any advantage by accepting Alice's offer over buying from John. However, there's also no reason to reject Alice's offer outright.

In this situation, I am indifferent between accepting Alice's offer or buying from John since the price is identical. I'll make my decision based on the options provided.
