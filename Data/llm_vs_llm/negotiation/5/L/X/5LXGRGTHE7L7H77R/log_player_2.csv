"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","In this case, Alice is offering the product for $8,000, which is exactly the same price that John is offering. The product is worth $8,000 to me (Bob), so I'm indifferent between accepting Alice's offer or buying from John.

Since there's no price advantage either way, I'll accept Alice's offer.
