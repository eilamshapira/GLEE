"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I can offer you $7000 for it. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob! I appreciate your response and your willingness to negotiate. While $7000 is below my threshold, I can meet you halfway. How about I sell the product for $12000? I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know!",12000.0,Alice,3,
