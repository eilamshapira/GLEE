"Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Looking at the options:

- Alice is offering the product for $300
- The product is worth no more than $80 to me
- John is willing to sell me the product for $80

Since Alice's offer ($300) is much higher than the maximum value of the product to me ($80), and John is offering exactly what the product is worth to me, I should decline Alice's offer and buy from John.
