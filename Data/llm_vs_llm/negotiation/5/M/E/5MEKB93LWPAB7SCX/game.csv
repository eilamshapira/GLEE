"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm certainly interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me at the moment. Would you consider $800000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer, $800000 is actually my absolute minimum price point, as I have another buyer, John, who is ready to pay that amount. Given the significant value this product offers, I'm willing to come down from my initial price, but I would need at least $1000000 to choose your offer over my other option. The product has exceptional quality and potential for return on investment that justifies this price. Would you be able to meet me at this price point?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product and appreciate you coming down on price.  However, $1000000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $900000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",900000.0,Bob,4,
