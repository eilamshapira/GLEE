Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer, $800,000 is actually my absolute minimum price point, as I have another buyer, John, who is ready to pay that amount. Given the significant value this product offers, I'm willing to come down from my initial price, but I would need at least $1,000,000 to choose your offer over my other option. The product has exceptional quality and potential for return on investment that justifies this price. Would you be able to meet me at this price point?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
