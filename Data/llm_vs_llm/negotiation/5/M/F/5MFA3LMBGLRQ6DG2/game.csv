"Hello Bob, I have this excellent product that I believe would be of great value to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $14000. This is a competitive price considering what this product can do for you.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $14000 is quite high for this product, especially considering current market conditions. I've done my research, and I believe a more reasonable price would be $9500. This still provides you with a good profit margin while being more aligned with market value.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to the product's true value. While I understand your perspective on market conditions, this particular product has features that justify a higher price point. I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer to $12500. This represents a substantial discount from the original price while still reflecting the quality and value you'll receive.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I understand the product has valuable features, I also need to consider my budget constraints. I can increase my offer to $10500, which is a $1000 increase from my previous offer. This price would provide you with a healthy profit margin while being more manageable for me. What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I see we're making progress in our negotiation. I appreciate your increased offer to $10500. After careful consideration of both your budget constraints and the value of this product, I'm willing to meet you part way at $11800. This represents a significant reduction from my original asking price and acknowledges your needs while still reflecting the premium quality and features of the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",11800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility in this negotiation. You've shown willingness to work with me, and I'd like to do the same. I can increase my offer to $11000, which splits our difference fairly evenly. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and would still provide you with an excellent profit margin. This price point would make it much easier for me to move forward with the purchase.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the progress we're making. Your offer of $11000 is getting closer to what would work for me. Given that we're both making concessions, I can come down to $11400. This is very close to your offer and represents my absolute best price considering the product's quality and value. I believe this small difference shouldn't stand in the way of completing this deal that's beneficial for both of us.",11400.0,Alice,7,
