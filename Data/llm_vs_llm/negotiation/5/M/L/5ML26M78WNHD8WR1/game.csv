"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $50 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering my budget.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $50 is much too low for this product. I have another buyer willing to pay $150, so I cannot go below that price. However, I can reduce my initial asking price to $175. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $50 was too low, but $175 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your reduced price. I'd like to offer $112.50 for the product.",112.5,Bob,4,
