"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $200. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $50 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $50 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $50 is much too low for this product. I have another buyer willing to pay $150, so I cannot go below that price. However, I can reduce my initial asking price to $175. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 175}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $50 was too low, but $175 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your reduced price. I'd like to offer $112.50 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's highest offer ($112.50) is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer of $150, and knowing that the product is only worth $80 to Bob, it's unlikely he'll increase his offer above $150. The most rational decision is to sell to John and secure the $150."
