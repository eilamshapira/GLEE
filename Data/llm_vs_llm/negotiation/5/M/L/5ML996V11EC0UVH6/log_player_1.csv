Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, Bob, let's talk business. I have a very special product that I think you'll be extremely interested in. Considering its value to you, and its rarity, I'm offering it to you for a price of:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive product. Knowing your interest in it, I'm offering it to you at a special price."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a tricky situation. Bob is offering my absolute floor price. I need to try and get a bit more, but I also don't want to lose the deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, Bob, I understand your position, but I've done some research and the value is significantly higher. Considering the unique qualities of this product, and its value to you specifically, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about:

{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, the product's value is substantial. I can offer it to you for a reduced price now."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price. However, I'm still looking to get the best deal possible. Considering my initial offer was $1000000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between your new offer and my initial offer. I'd like to propose $1050000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob is clearly trying to lowball me. While $1,050,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to him, and less than I initially hoped to get.

I think I can push a little further. I'll reject and counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob, you're a tough negotiator, I'll give you that! However, this is truly a rare and valuable item. To show you I'm serious about making a deal, and to recognize that we're getting closer, I'm willing to meet you closer to your last offer.

{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, and I'm willing to adjust my price further."", ""product_price"": 1075000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. Your latest offer of $1075000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still trying to stay within a budget. I'd like to propose $1060000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer but still below your current price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a tough decision. Bob is only offering $1,060,000, which is $60,000 more than what I could get from John. While I'd prefer a higher price, I also don't want to lose the sale entirely. I've pushed for a higher price and now I must accept Bob's offer.
