"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for a price of $1500000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I believe its value to you could be even higher. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be realistic about my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $600000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'll come down to $1200000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while also accommodating your budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but the gap between our positions is still too wide. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but it needs to make sense for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $700000? That's a substantial increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my strong interest.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate your commitment.  $700000 is still too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $900000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it demonstrates my desire to make this deal work. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $900000 is getting closer, but it's still a stretch for me. I'd be willing to go to $750000. This is a significant investment on my part and shows how much I value this product. What do you say, can we make this work?",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $750000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make one last move.  I'll offer $850000. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll need to consider other options.  I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,7,
