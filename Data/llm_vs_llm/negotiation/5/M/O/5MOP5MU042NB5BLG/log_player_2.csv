Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'll come down to $1200000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate your commitment.  $700000 is still too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $900000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it demonstrates my desire to make this deal work. What do you say?

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $900,000 is getting closer, but it's still a stretch for me. I'd be willing to go to $750,000. This is a significant investment on my part and shows how much I value this product. What do you say, can we make this work?"",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $750000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make one last move.  I'll offer $850000. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll need to consider other options.  I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
