I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly.  To kick things off, I'd like to propose a starting price of $18,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $6000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is extremely low and likely significantly undervalues the product. While I want to be flexible, accepting a price that's a third of my minimum would be a significant loss.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $6,000 is significantly below the product's true value.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  While I appreciate your increased offer, the gap between our valuations is still quite wide.
