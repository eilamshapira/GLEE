"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, I need to consider the true value of what I'm offering. The product is worth significantly more than $12000, which happens to be my absolute minimum. Given its quality and value, I can come down to $13500, which still represents good value for what you're getting. This is a fair middle ground between our positions.",13500.0,Alice,3,
