"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of my product with you. I'm offering it at a price of $2000000. I believe this investment could be highly beneficial for you. Let me know what you think!",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $800000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800000 is significantly lower than I can accept. I can offer the product for $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts!",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1800000 is still too far out of my budget.  How about $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your position, $1000000 is still below what I can accept. How about I meet you halfway at $1500000? This price reflects the true value of the product. Let me know if that works for you!",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  However, that's still a significant gap for me. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, say $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I cannot go as low as $1250000. I can do $1400000, which is a fair compromise between our offers. Let me know if that works for you!",1400000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting very close.  I'm willing to come up a bit, how about $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your flexibility, but I still cannot accept $1300000. How about we settle at $1350000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's true value. Looking forward to your response!",1350000.0,Alice,9,
