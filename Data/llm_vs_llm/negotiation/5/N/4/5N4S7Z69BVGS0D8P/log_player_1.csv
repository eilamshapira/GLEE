"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, I will not accept it. Additionally, selling to John for $8,000 is an option, but I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

My counteroffer to Bob is: $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.
