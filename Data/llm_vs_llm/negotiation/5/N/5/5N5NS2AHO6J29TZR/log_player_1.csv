Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my price offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at exactly $1,000,000, I should offer Bob a price above this amount.

If I set the price too high, Bob might reject it. If I set it only slightly above my reservation value, I'm not maximizing my potential profit. Given that I don't know Bob's valuation, I'll offer a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected.
