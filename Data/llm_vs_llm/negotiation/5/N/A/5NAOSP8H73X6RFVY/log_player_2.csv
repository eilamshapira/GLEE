"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's alternative offer ($1,000,000). It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer when I have a better alternative. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to negotiate a better price with Alice, knowing I always have John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 900000}

Rationale: I'll start with a relatively low offer of $900,000 for a few strategic reasons:
1. It's below my maximum value of $1,000,000
2. It gives room for negotiation, as Alice will likely counter
3. Since I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, there's potential for a deal between $900,000 and $1,200,000 that could benefit both parties
4. If negotiations fail, I still have John's $1,000,000 offer as a backup"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: Alice has only slightly reduced her price from $1,250,000 to $1,220,000, which is still well above both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's offer ($1,000,000). While Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate by lowering the price, the current offer is still not competitive. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, as there's still plenty of room for negotiation and several rounds remaining. If Alice doesn't come down to a more reasonable price, I can always take John's offer later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 950000}

Rationale: I'll increase my offer to $950,000 for these reasons:
1. It shows I'm willing to move up from my initial offer of $900,000, demonstrating good faith in negotiations
2. It's still below both my maximum value and John's offer of $1,000,000
3. Since Alice's product is worth $1,200,000 to her, a sale at $950,000 would still allow her to avoid a loss
4. By moving up $50,000, I'm signaling that I'm serious about making a deal
5. I'm maintaining a safety margin below John's offer, which remains my backup plan"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Rationale: At this point, I'm choosing to buy from John because:
1. Alice's current offer ($1,200,000) is still significantly above my maximum value ($1,000,000)
2. While Alice has shown some movement in price (from $1,250,000 to $1,200,000), she seems unwilling to go below her cost value ($1,200,000)
3. John's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly at my maximum value
4. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation without getting close to a mutually beneficial price
5. There's no indication that Alice will drop her price below John's offer
6. Continuing to negotiate might just waste time when I have a guaranteed acceptable option with John

It's time to take the sure deal with John rather than continue negotiations that don't seem likely to result in a better outcome."
