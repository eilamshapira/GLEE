"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see how much Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $10,000, and far below what the product is worth to me. I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum, but still gives Bob some room to negotiate. I'm hoping to find a middle ground where we can both be satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to what I'm willing to accept, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm coming down in my price a bit, but still staying above my minimum. I want to make a serious effort to reach a deal with Bob, but I'm not willing to go lower than $8,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not high enough. I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob for a slightly better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

I'm making one final concession. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. If he doesn't, I'll move on to John."
