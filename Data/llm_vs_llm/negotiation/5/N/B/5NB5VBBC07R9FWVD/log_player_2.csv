"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's offer. She is offering the product for $11,000, but it's only worth $8,000 to me. Additionally, I know I can buy the same product from John for exactly $8,000.

Alice's current offer is higher than both my maximum valuation and John's alternative price, so it doesn't make sense to accept it. I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice, taking into account both our positions.

{""product_price"": $6,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has lowered her price to $9,000, which is a significant reduction from her initial offer of $11,000. However, this is still higher than John's price of $8,000, and it's still above my maximum valuation of $8,000.

Since I can buy the same product from John for $8,000, and Alice's offer exceeds that price, the rational decision is to reject Alice's current offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a more reasonable counteroffer to Alice, moving closer to what might be acceptable to both of us while keeping in mind my alternatives.

{""product_price"": $7,200}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has now offered $8,500, which is getting closer to what I might be willing to pay. However, this is still higher than John's price of $8,000, and John's price matches my maximum valuation.

Given that I can get the same product from John for $8,000, and this option is both cheaper than Alice's current offer and exactly matches my maximum valuation, the rational choice is to reject Alice's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make one more counteroffer to Alice that's very close to my alternative option, giving her a final chance to make a deal that works for both of us.

{""product_price"": $7,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has now offered $8,000, which exactly matches John's price of $8,000 and is equal to my maximum valuation of $8,000. 

Since both options (buying from Alice or buying from John) now have the same price, and this price is exactly at my maximum valuation, I'm indifferent between the two options. I'll accept Alice's offer since we've already invested time in this negotiation.
