You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $7,500 as it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 (and even lower than John's guaranteed offer). However, I'll continue negotiating with Bob since we still have several rounds left.

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's new offer of $8,500 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and he's only increased his offer by a small amount ($1,000). Since he's not showing significant movement toward a reasonable price and we've already used 4 rounds, I'll choose to sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000 rather than risk further negotiations.
