"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the value I'm looking for, I'd be happy to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and the offer you've made. However, I must say that $80 is below the product's value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. With that in mind, I'd like to make a counteroffer.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, and I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",100.0,Bob,4,
