"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1000000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.  Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,200,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000
3. John's fixed price is $1,200,000

Alice's offer at $1,000,000 is $200,000 less than John's price and below my maximum value. This is a good deal that would save me money compared to buying from John.

Therefore, I should accept Alice's offer.
