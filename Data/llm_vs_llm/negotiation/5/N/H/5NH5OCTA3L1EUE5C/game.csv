"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique value and the effort it takes to part with it, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I need to be transparent that your asking price of $950000 is well above what makes sense for me financially. I'm aware that the product is valued at $800000, and that's actually my maximum budget for this purchase. In fact, I have another seller, John, who has already agreed to sell me the identical product for $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer you $700000, which provides you room to counter while still giving me savings compared to my alternative option.",700000.0,Bob,2,
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. However, given the value of this product, I'm not able to accept $700000. I understand you have a budget of $800000, and I am willing to consider that, since I am the seller you like the most. I offer $880000. I think this is a fair price given the unique value of the product.",880000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your perspective. Considering the value of this product and the other options available, I'm willing to meet you closer to your maximum budget. How about we settle at $860000? It's still a significant price, but I believe it reflects the true value of the product, and that is still better than your alternative.",860000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. However, I still need to be practical about this. I have a firm budget ceiling of $800000 for this product, which is exactly what John is asking. For me to choose you over the guaranteed option with John, I would need some financial incentive. I can offer you $750000, which still gives you a reasonable price while providing me with savings compared to my alternative. This would allow us both to walk away satisfied with the deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I understand your position. However, I still believe the product is worth closer to $800000 for both of us. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and settle for $820000. This gives you a good deal and allows me to walk away with a reasonable profit.",820000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm offering the product for $820000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value and your willingness to prioritize working with me. It allows you to get the product while offering me some benefit.",820000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me and reducing your price. However, I need to be completely straightforward - I simply cannot pay more than $800000 for this product. That's both my maximum budget and exactly what John is offering. In fact, to make it worthwhile for me to continue our negotiation rather than just going with John's offer immediately, I would need to pay less than $800000. My offer is $780000, which is a fair price that allows you to make the sale while giving me a small incentive to choose you over my alternative. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $800000, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.",780000.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, and I am trying to accommodate you, I cannot accept less than $800000 for this product. I want to make this deal happen, so I am offering the product to you for $800000. If you accept this, it is a done deal; if you don't accept, I will sell to John.",800000.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I am offering the product for $800000. This is my final offer. If you accept, we have a deal. If you reject, I will be selling to John.",800000.0,Alice,7,
