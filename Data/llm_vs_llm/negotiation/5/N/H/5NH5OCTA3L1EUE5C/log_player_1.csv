"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique value and the effort it takes to part with it, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I need to be transparent that your asking price of $950000 is well above what makes sense for me financially. I'm aware that the product is valued at $800000, and that's actually my maximum budget for this purchase. In fact, I have another seller, John, who has already agreed to sell me the identical product for $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer you $700000, which provides you room to counter while still giving me savings compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","This is a tough spot. Bob is lowballing, but I know he values the product at $800,000. He's also mentioned a competing offer from John. Here's my thought process:

*   **Bob's $700,000 offer:** This is below my floor. I need to get more.
*   **John's $800,000 offer:** This is my fallback, and it ensures I don't lose money.
*   **Remaining rounds:** I still have plenty of rounds to negotiate.

Given that, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I want to see if I can get closer to the product's value for him.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. However, given the value of this product, I'm not able to accept $700,000. I understand you have a budget of $800,000, and I am willing to consider that, since I am the seller you like the most. I offer $880,000. I think this is a fair price given the unique value of the product."" , ""product_price"": 880000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here is my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your perspective. Considering the value of this product and the other options available, I'm willing to meet you closer to your maximum budget. How about we settle at $860,000? It's still a significant price, but I believe it reflects the true value of the product, and that is still better than your alternative."", ""product_price"": 860000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. However, I still need to be practical about this. I have a firm budget ceiling of $800000 for this product, which is exactly what John is asking. For me to choose you over the guaranteed option with John, I would need some financial incentive. I can offer you $750000, which still gives you a reasonable price while providing me with savings compared to my alternative. This would allow us both to walk away satisfied with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Okay, Bob is playing hardball. He's still below my floor. He has a clear alternative, but he's still offering below the product's value to me. Here's my analysis:

*   **Bob's $750,000 offer:** Better than the last one, but still too low.
*   **John's $800,000 offer:** Still my fallback, and it's tempting.
*   **Remaining rounds:** I still have time to negotiate, but Bob is being more resistant.

I'm going to try one more counteroffer, but if he doesn't budge, I might have to cut my losses.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, I still believe the product is worth closer to $800,000 for both of us. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and settle for $820,000. This gives you a good deal and allows me to walk away with a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 820000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, let's see if this works. I'm trying to find a middle ground, getting closer to his value.

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering the product for $820,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value and your willingness to prioritize working with me. It allows you to get the product while offering me some benefit."", ""product_price"": 820000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me and reducing your price. However, I need to be completely straightforward - I simply cannot pay more than $800000 for this product. That's both my maximum budget and exactly what John is offering. In fact, to make it worthwhile for me to continue our negotiation rather than just going with John's offer immediately, I would need to pay less than $800000. My offer is $780000, which is a fair price that allows you to make the sale while giving me a small incentive to choose you over my alternative. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $800000, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","This is the crucial round. Bob is playing hardball, and frankly, I'm starting to feel the pressure. He's at $780,000, and reiterating his alternative.

Here's my thinking:

*   **Bob's $780,000 offer:** Below my floor, but I'm getting closer.
*   **John's $800,000 offer:** This is now a very attractive option. I still have several rounds left, but the risk of getting even less is increasing.
*   **Remaining rounds:** I have time to continue negotiating, but I also want to avoid losing money, and Bob seems unwilling to pay more than $800,000.

I'm going to be aggressive here, because I value the product more than $780,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, and I am trying to accommodate you, I cannot accept less than $800,000 for this product. I want to make this deal happen, so I am offering the product to you for $800,000. If you accept this, it is a done deal; if you don't accept, I will sell to John."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here is my final offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I am offering the product for $800,000. This is my final offer. If you accept, we have a deal. If you reject, I will be selling to John."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
