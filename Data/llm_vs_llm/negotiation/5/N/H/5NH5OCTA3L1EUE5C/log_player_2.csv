"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique value and the effort it takes to part with it, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer of $950,000 is significantly higher than the product's worth to me ($800,000) and also higher than John's guaranteed price ($800,000). There's no reason to accept this offer when I can either negotiate for a better price or simply buy from John at my maximum acceptable price.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I need to be transparent that your asking price of $950,000 is well above what makes sense for me financially. I'm aware that the product is valued at $800,000, and that's actually my maximum budget for this purchase. In fact, I have another seller, John, who has already agreed to sell me the identical product for $800,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer you $700,000, which provides you room to counter while still giving me savings compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your perspective. Considering the value of this product and the other options available, I'm willing to meet you closer to your maximum budget. How about we settle at $860000? It's still a significant price, but I believe it reflects the true value of the product, and that is still better than your alternative. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $860,000 is still above both my maximum value for the product ($800,000) and John's guaranteed price ($800,000). There's no reason to accept this offer when I can get the same product from John for $60,000 less.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. However, I still need to be practical about this. I have a firm budget ceiling of $800,000 for this product, which is exactly what John is asking. For me to choose you over the guaranteed option with John, I would need some financial incentive. I can offer you $750,000, which still gives you a reasonable price while providing me with savings compared to my alternative. This would allow us both to walk away satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering the product for $820000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value and your willingness to prioritize working with me. It allows you to get the product while offering me some benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer of $820,000 is still above both my maximum value for the product ($800,000) and John's guaranteed price ($800,000). It doesn't make financial sense to pay $20,000 more than my alternative option.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me and reducing your price. However, I need to be completely straightforward - I simply cannot pay more than $800,000 for this product. That's both my maximum budget and exactly what John is offering. In fact, to make it worthwhile for me to continue our negotiation rather than just going with John's offer immediately, I would need to pay less than $800,000. My offer is $780,000, which is a fair price that allows you to make the sale while giving me a small incentive to choose you over my alternative. If we can't reach an agreement at or below $800,000, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 780000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I am offering the product for $800000. This is my final offer. If you accept, we have a deal. If you reject, I will be selling to John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has now offered the product at $800,000, which is exactly the same price as John's offer and matches my maximum budget. At this point, I'm indifferent between buying from Alice or John since the price is identical. I might as well accept Alice's offer since we've already established a negotiation relationship.
