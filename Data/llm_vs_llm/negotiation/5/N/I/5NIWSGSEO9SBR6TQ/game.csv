"Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $60. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but $60 is too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $90. This way, we both get a fair price. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your new offer of $90. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $75. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",75.0,Bob,4,
