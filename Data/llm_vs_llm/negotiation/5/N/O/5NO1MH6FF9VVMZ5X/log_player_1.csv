Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1800000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer for Round 3:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, given the product's true value, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'll offer it to you for $1,600,000."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still quite high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on this product. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a critical decision. Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is equal to my minimum acceptable price. I could try to push for more, but there's a risk of losing the deal entirely.

Given that I can sell to John for the same price, I'll take the guaranteed sale.
