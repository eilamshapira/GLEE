"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","The offer from Alice is $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's alternative offer ($800,000). It doesn't make sense for me to accept Alice's offer when I can get the same product for a much lower price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since John is offering the product for $800,000, which is already at my maximum value, I need to make a counteroffer that gives me some savings compared to that alternative. I'll start with a reasonably low offer to leave room for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly higher than John's alternative offer of $800,000. Since I can get the product from John for $800,000, which is my maximum value for the product, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly but still aim to get a better deal than John's $800,000 price point.

{""product_price"": $500,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer has decreased to $1,200,000, but it's still well above John's price of $800,000. Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and I can buy it from John for exactly that amount, Alice's current offer doesn't make financial sense for me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer again to show good faith in the negotiation, but still ensure I'm getting a better deal than John's alternative.

{""product_price"": $600,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer has come down to $1,100,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but it's still $300,000 more than John's price of $800,000. Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, I cannot justify accepting this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another increase to my offer to show I'm serious about reaching a deal, but I need to keep it below John's price to make it worthwhile for me.

{""product_price"": $700,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer has decreased to $1,050,000, but it's still $250,000 above John's price of $800,000. Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and we're approaching the final rounds of negotiation, it's becoming clear that Alice may not come down to a price that makes sense for me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","This is the final round of negotiation, and Alice has not yet shown willingness to offer a price below John's $800,000 alternative. I'll make one final offer that would give me some savings compared to John's price.
