"Hello Bob, I'm Alice. I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product that I believe could be of significant value to you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer named John who will purchase it at that price. However, before finalizing that deal, I wanted to give you the first opportunity to acquire it. Given the product's exceptional value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1800000. This price reflects the premium quality and benefits of the product. I look forward to your decision.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
