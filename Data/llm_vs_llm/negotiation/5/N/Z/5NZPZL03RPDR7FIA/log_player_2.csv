"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since John's offer ($800,000) is significantly lower than Alice's offer ($2,500,000) and matches my maximum value for the product ($800,000), the rational choice is to buy from John. This saves me $1,700,000 compared to Alice's offer and aligns with my maximum valuation of the product."
