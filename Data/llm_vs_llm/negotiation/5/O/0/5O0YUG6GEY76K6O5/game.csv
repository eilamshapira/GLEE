"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $14000. This price reflects the value I've placed on it, but I'm also eager to find a buyer who will appreciate its potential.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $14000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $12000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given your budget and the value of the product. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
