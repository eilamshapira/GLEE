"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $149. Would you like to buy it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

- The product is worth at most $150 to me
- Alice is offering it for $149
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $150

Alice's product is $1 cheaper than John's offer. While the price is very close to my maximum valuation, it still saves me $1 compared to my alternative option.
