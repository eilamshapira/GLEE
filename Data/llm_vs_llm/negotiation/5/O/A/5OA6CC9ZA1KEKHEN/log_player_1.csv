Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. Since I know:
1. The product is worth at least $15,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $15,000
3. Bob's valuation is unknown, but could be higher

I should offer a price significantly above $15,000 to try to capture more value, while knowing I have the safety net of John's offer if Bob declines.
