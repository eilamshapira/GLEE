"Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $300 is significantly higher than the product's worth to me ($120) and higher than John's price ($120). It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. If the negotiation doesn't go well, I can always fall back on John's offer of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}

I'll offer $80, which is significantly lower than John's price of $120. This gives room for negotiation while potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's price. If Alice rejects this offer, we can still negotiate upward, and I always have John's $120 offer as a backup."
