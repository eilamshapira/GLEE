"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is lower than the minimum value of $8,000 that the product is worth to me, and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer. However, I still want to try to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Therefore, I will proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

My counteroffer is: $10,000

So, my decision is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} and I'll wait for Bob's response to my counteroffer."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $7,000 is still lower than what I was hoping to get, but closer to my target, I will reject Bob's offer again. However, I notice that Bob's offer is getting closer to the price that I can get from John, which is $8,000. 

I will proceed to the next round with a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous offer, to see if we can meet in the middle.

My counteroffer is: $9,000

So, my decision is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} and I'll wait for Bob's response to my counteroffer.
