Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll send an offer to Bob for the product. 

Based on the information I have:
- The product is worth at least $800,000 to me
- I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $800,000
- I don't know how much the product is worth to Bob

Since I have a guaranteed $800,000 from John, I want to set my price to Bob higher than that. However, I don't want to price it so high that he automatically rejects it. I'll set a price that gives me a significant premium over my guaranteed alternative while still potentially being attractive to Bob.
