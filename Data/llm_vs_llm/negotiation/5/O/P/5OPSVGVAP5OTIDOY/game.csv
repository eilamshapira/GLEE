"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12000 is quite high for this product. I've done my market research, and I can actually get a similar product elsewhere for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Would you consider $6500? This would be a fair price that works for both of us.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your perspective and willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your position, the $6500 offer is significantly below the true value of this product. I've priced it competitively, and I'm confident in its worth.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9500?",9500.0,Alice,3,
