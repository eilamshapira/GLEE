"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12000 is quite high for this product. I've done my market research, and I can actually get a similar product elsewhere for $8000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Would you consider $6500? This would be a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your perspective and willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your position, the $6,500 offer is significantly below the true value of this product. I've priced it competitively, and I'm confident in its worth.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,500?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
