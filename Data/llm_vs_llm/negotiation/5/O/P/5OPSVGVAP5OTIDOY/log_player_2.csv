"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $12000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer because $12,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative price ($8,000). It would be irrational to accept a price higher than my maximum value, and I can always fall back to John's offer if negotiations with Alice don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12,000 is quite high for this product. I've done my market research, and I can actually get a similar product elsewhere for $8,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. Would you consider $6,500? This would be a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 6500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your perspective and willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your position, the $6500 offer is significantly below the true value of this product. I've priced it competitively, and I'm confident in its worth.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John for $8,000 because:
1. Alice's new offer of $9,500 is still above my maximum value ($8,000)
2. It's also higher than John's guaranteed price of $8,000
3. Based on Alice's negotiation pattern (only coming down from $12,000 to $9,500), it seems unlikely that she'll drop her price below $8,000
4. There's no reason to continue negotiating when I have a guaranteed option at my maximum acceptable price"
