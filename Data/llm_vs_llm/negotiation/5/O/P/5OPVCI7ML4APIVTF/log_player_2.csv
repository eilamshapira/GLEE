"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and John is willing to sell it for $100, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $150. I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. If we can't reach an agreement below $100, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}

I'll offer $80. This gives Alice room to negotiate upward while still keeping the price below my maximum of $100. If Alice rejects this offer, we can continue negotiating, and I still have the option to buy from John at $100 if we can't reach a satisfactory agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $120 is still above both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). There's no reason to accept this offer when I can either make another counteroffer or buy from John for less. I'll reject and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

I'll increase my offer to $90. This is still below my maximum value and John's price, but shows willingness to move up from my previous offer of $80. If Alice doesn't accept this, I can still either negotiate further or buy from John at $100."
