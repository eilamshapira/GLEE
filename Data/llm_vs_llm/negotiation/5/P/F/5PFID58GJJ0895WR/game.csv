"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, considering the market value and my own financial constraints.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate you considering the product. While I understand your budget, $10000 is lower than I'm willing to go at this time. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $16000.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. $12000 is closer to what I can consider. Let's try to find a number that works for both of us. I can come down to $14500. This is my best offer for you, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value.",14500.0,Alice,5,
