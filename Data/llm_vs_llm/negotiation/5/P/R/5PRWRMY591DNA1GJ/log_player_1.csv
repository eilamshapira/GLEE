Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Okay, considering my options, I want to maximize my profit. I know the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, and Bob values it at $12,000. Bob's offer of $10,000 is a good deal for me.

Therefore:
