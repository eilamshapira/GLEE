"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I’m reaching out to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I am prepared to sell it for $1500000 – a price that reflects its premium nature and the quality you can expect. Should this proposal not be the right fit for you, please note that I will be finalizing the sale with another buyer for $1000000. I hope you see the value in this opportunity and I look forward to hearing from you soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $1,500,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within my budget.
