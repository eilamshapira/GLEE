"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Explanation (not part of response): The current offer from Alice is $1,500,000, which is the same as John's price. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation to get a better price. It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1250000}

Explanation (not part of response): I'm offering $1,250,000 which is:
1. Higher than Alice's cost ($1,200,000), giving her a $50,000 profit
2. Significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price ($1,500,000)
3. A reasonable starting point for negotiation that leaves room for further adjustment if needed
4. Still saves me $250,000 compared to the alternative options"

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1300000}

Explanation (not part of response): I'm increasing my previous offer from $1,250,000 to $1,300,000 because:
1. It shows I'm willing to move up from my initial position
