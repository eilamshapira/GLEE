"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice's initial offer is $1,500,000, which is much higher than my maximum budget, I will reject Alice's offer. I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and closer to my maximum budget. Since I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, I'll make an offer that is significantly lower, but still shows that I'm interested in buying the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,400,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. While it's a slight improvement from her initial offer, it's still not a price I'm willing to pay.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and consider making another counteroffer. However, I'll also keep in mind that I have the option to buy the product from John for $800,000, which is my maximum budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer that is still within my budget and shows that I'm willing to negotiate. Since Alice's last offer was $1,400,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her offer and my previous counteroffer of $600,000.
