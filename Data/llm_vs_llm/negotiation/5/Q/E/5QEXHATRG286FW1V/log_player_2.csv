"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this unique item. Given its exclusivity and the meticulous craftsmanship, I'm offering it to you for a price of: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice's offer is $25,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $8,000

The logical decision would be to purchase from John since:
- Alice's price ($25,000) is more than three times higher than my maximum value ($8,000)
- John's price ($8,000) matches my maximum value
- There's no reason to accept Alice's much higher price when I can get the same product at a lower price
