"Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is quite high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $500000 for the product.  What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and your counteroffer. I appreciate your response, but $500000 is significantly below the product's value. Given that I have another buyer willing to pay $1000000, I couldn't accept anything less than that amount. However, considering our potential business relationship, I can reduce my initial asking price to $1500000. This represents a substantial discount from my original offer while still reflecting the true value of the product.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1500000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  I can go up to $700000. This is a strong offer on my end, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price point that works for you, and I appreciate you increasing your offer to $700000. However, I must emphasize that I have a guaranteed buyer at $1000000, which represents my absolute minimum acceptable price. Given our negotiations so far, I'm willing to come down further to $1250000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offers. This price reflects both the true market value of the product while also giving you a competitive advantage over market rates.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
