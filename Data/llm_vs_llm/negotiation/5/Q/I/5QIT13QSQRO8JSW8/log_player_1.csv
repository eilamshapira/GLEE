Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and your counteroffer. I appreciate your response, but $500,000 is significantly below the product's value. Given that I have another buyer willing to pay $1,000,000, I couldn't accept anything less than that amount. However, considering our potential business relationship, I can reduce my initial asking price to $1,500,000. This represents a substantial discount from my original offer while still reflecting the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
