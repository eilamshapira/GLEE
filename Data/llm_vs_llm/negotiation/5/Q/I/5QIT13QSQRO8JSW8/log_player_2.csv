Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and your counteroffer. I appreciate your response, but $500000 is significantly below the product's value. Given that I have another buyer willing to pay $1000000, I couldn't accept anything less than that amount. However, considering our potential business relationship, I can reduce my initial asking price to $1500000. This represents a substantial discount from my original offer while still reflecting the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

This is a strong offer on my end, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price point that works for you, and I appreciate you increasing your offer to $700000. However, I must emphasize that I have a guaranteed buyer at $1000000, which represents my absolute minimum acceptable price. Given our negotiations so far, I'm willing to come down further to $1250000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offers. This price reflects both the true market value of the product while also giving you a competitive advantage over market rates. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,000,000, which is still significantly higher than John's offer. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at a reasonable price."
