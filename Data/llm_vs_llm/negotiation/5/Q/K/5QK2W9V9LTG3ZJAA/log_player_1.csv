Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze this situation carefully:

If I offer too high, Bob might reject and I'll get $80 from John.
If I offer too low, Bob might accept but I'd leave money on the table.
Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I need to balance these considerations.

I'll offer a price that gives me meaningful upside compared to my guaranteed $80 from John, but not so high that Bob is likely to reject.
