"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'll analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $110
2. Reject Alice's offer (unclear outcome)
3. Buy from John: $120

Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $110, which is $10 less than John's price, I should accept Alice's offer to maximize my savings.
