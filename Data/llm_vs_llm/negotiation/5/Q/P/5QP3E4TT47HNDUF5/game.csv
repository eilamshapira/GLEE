"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm aiming for a lower price point. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $700000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a good compromise.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking for a lower price point, but I'm afraid $700000 is below my acceptable range. I'm willing to compromise and make a counteroffer of $900000, which I believe is a fair price for the product. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to move forward with the transaction.",800000.0,Bob,4,
