Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm aiming for a lower price point. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $700000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as his offer of $700,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. 

My counteroffer: $900,000. This price reflects the product's value and is a compromise from my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will consider it and we can move forward with the sale."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking for a lower price point, but I'm afraid $700,000 is below my acceptable range. I'm willing to compromise and make a counteroffer of $900,000, which I believe is a fair price for the product. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob's offer of $800,000 is the same price that John is willing to pay, and I don't have any additional information about Bob's willingness to pay more, I've decided to sell the product to John for $800,000. This ensures that I get a fair price for the product, and I don't have to continue negotiating with Bob."
