"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $14000 seems quite high considering market conditions. Given that similar products are available in the market, I would be comfortable purchasing it for $10000, which I believe is a fair price considering its features and value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your perspective. While $10,000 is lower than I initially hoped for, I'm willing to meet you somewhat in the middle. How about $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
