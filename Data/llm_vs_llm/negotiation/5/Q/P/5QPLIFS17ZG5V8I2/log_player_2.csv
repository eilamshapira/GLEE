"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited you're interested in the product! Given its unique value and the benefits it offers, I'm offering it to you for $14000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $15,000
2. Alice's offer is $14,000
3. John's fixed price is $15,000
4. The product costs Alice $8,000

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still quite high, being only $1,000 less than John's price and $6,000 above her cost. There's likely room for negotiation here. Since there's no immediate pressure to accept and I can always buy from John later, I should try to negotiate for a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $14,000 seems quite high considering market conditions. Given that similar products are available in the market, I would be comfortable purchasing it for $10,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its features and value."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your perspective. While $10000 is lower than I initially hoped for, I'm willing to meet you somewhat in the middle. How about $12500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has moved down significantly from her initial offer of $14,000 to $12,500
2. That's a $1,500 reduction and $2,500 less than John's price
3. However, knowing that her cost is $8,000, there might still be room for negotiation
4. She showed willingness to negotiate by making a substantial move

While we could try another counteroffer, there's a risk of pushing too hard and potentially damaging the negotiation. $12,500 represents a good compromise and provides me with meaningful savings compared to John's price. Given this analysis, I think it's reasonable to accept this offer.
