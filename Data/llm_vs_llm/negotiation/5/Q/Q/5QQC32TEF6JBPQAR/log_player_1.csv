Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price to offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price, I should offer Bob a higher price to maximize my earnings.

If Bob values the product higher than my asking price, he'll accept. If not, I still have my $1,000,000 from John as a backup.

Given that I don't know Bob's valuation, I'll set a significantly higher price than my minimum, but not so high that it seems completely unreasonable.
