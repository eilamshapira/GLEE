"Hi Bob, I'm Alice. I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on its features and market value, I'm offering it at $15000. This is a competitive price for a product of this caliber, and I believe it would be a valuable addition for you. Are you interested in purchasing at this price?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I can't go that low. The product is worth at least $12000 to me, and I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $13500, which is still a good value considering the quality of the product. How does that sound?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $13500 is still above what I'm willing to spend. Given that you mentioned John is willing to pay $12000, I'd like to offer $11000. This is a fair compromise, considering my budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go below $12000 for this product, as that's its minimum value to me. Since I have John ready to pay exactly $12000, I need to at least match that amount to consider selling to you instead. If you can meet me at $12500, that would give me a reason to sell to you rather than John. This is my final offer - what do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
