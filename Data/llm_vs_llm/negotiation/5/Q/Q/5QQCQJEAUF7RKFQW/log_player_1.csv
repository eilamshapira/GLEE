Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. What do you think?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

Given that you mentioned John is willing to pay $12000, I'd like to offer $11000. This is a fair compromise, considering my budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.
