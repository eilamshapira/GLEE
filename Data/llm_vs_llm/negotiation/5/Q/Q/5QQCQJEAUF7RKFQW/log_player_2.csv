# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm Alice. I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on its features and market value, I'm offering it at $15000. This is a competitive price for a product of this caliber, and I believe it would be a valuable addition for you. Are you interested in purchasing at this price?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I can't go that low. The product is worth at least $12000 to me, and I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $13500, which is still a good value considering the quality of the product. How does that sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Given that you mentioned John is willing to pay $12,000, I'd like to offer $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering my budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go below $12000 for this product, as that's its minimum value to me. Since I have John ready to pay exactly $12000, I need to at least match that amount to consider selling to you instead. If you can meet me at $12500, that would give me a reason to sell to you rather than John. This is my final offer - what do you think?
