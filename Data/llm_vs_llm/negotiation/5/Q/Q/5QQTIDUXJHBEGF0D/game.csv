"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, the price of $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob! I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go as low as $8000. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to offer the product to you for $12000. Let me know if this works for you.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9000. I believe this is a reasonable price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob! Thank you for your offer of $9000. I appreciate your interest, but I need to make a better deal. How about $11000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product. Let me know your thoughts!",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I can see that we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not comfortable paying $11000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9500. I believe this is a fair price, considering our previous discussions. Let me know if this works for you.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob! I appreciate your counteroffer of $9500, but I still need to get a better price for the value of this product. How about we settle at $10500? I think it's a fair compromise. Looking forward to your response!",10500.0,Alice,7,
