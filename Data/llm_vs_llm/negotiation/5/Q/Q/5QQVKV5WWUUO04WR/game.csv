"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great fit for you. Given its market value and quality, I'm offering it at $950000. This is a competitive price for a product of this caliber.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800000 for this product. Could you consider selling it to me for $700000? I believe this is a fair price given my constraints.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $700000 as it's below my minimum threshold. I have another buyer willing to pay $800000, but I'd prefer to work with you. I can reduce my initial asking price to $875000, which is still a competitive offer given the product's value.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $875000 is still above my budget. Given that you mentioned another buyer at $800000, I'm willing to match that offer. Could you accept $800000 for the product? This would allow us to close the deal and meet both our needs.",800000.0,Bob,4,
