"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great fit for you. Given its market value and quality, I'm offering it at $950,000. This is a competitive price for a product of this caliber."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800000 for this product. Could you consider selling it to me for $700000? I believe this is a fair price given my constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. His offer of $700,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, and even below John's guaranteed offer. Let me try to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $700,000 as it's below my minimum threshold. I have another buyer willing to pay $800,000, but I'd prefer to work with you. I can reduce my initial asking price to $875,000, which is still a competitive offer given the product's value."", ""product_price"": 875000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $875000 is still above my budget. Given that you mentioned another buyer at $800000, I'm willing to match that offer. Could you accept $800000 for the product? This would allow us to close the deal and meet both our needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John. Since Bob is only willing to match John's price and shows no indication of going higher, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed offer from John now. This saves time and ensures we get our minimum price without further back-and-forth."
