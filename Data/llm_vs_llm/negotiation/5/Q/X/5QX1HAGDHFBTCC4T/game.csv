"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the potential value of this product, $3000000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. This reflects my genuine interest in the product, but also acknowledges that we need to find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you, Bob, for your offer. I understand that $3000000 might be out of your budget, but $1000000 is lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering your interest and my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to reduce the price. However, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's meet in the middle and discuss further.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $2000000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. However, to show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1500000. This is my final offer, as it's the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if this works for you.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
