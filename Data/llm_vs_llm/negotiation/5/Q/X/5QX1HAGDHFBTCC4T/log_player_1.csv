"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a competitive price, considering the product's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the potential value of this product, $3000000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. This reflects my genuine interest in the product, but also acknowledges that we need to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $1,000,000 because it's significantly lower than the product's worth to me. Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, I'll try to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can meet at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you, Bob, for your offer. I understand that $3,000,000 might be out of your budget, but $1,000,000 is lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering your interest and my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to reduce the price. However, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's meet in the middle and discuss further."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $2000000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. However, to show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1500000. This is my final offer, as it's the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob's final offer of $1,500,000 matches the price I can get from John, and I've been trying to negotiate the best possible deal with Bob, accepting this offer seems like the most reasonable choice. It allows me to close the deal without potentially losing both buyers."
