Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $18,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while the product seems interesting, $18000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $6000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. Selling to John for $12,000 is a better option than accepting Bob's offer, but I want to try to negotiate a better price with Bob first.

Here's my counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000, considering the product's exceptional value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a more reasonable offer from your side."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.
