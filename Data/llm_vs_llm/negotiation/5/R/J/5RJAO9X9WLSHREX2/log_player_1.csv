"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I'm offering the product for sale at $120. Let me know if you're interested in buying it at that price."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $120 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. Since I know I can get the same product elsewhere for $100, I'd like to offer you $80 for it. This would save me some money while still giving you a sale today. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
