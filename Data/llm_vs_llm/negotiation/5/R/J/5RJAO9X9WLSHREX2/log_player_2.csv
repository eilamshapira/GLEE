"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I'm offering the product for sale at $120. Let me know if you're interested in buying it at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $120, which is more than the $100 valuation I have for it. Since I know I can buy the product from John for $100, there's no reason to accept an offer that's higher than that.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $120 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. Since I know I can get the same product elsewhere for $100, I'd like to offer you $80 for it. This would save me some money while still giving you a sale today. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
