"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Given that I have another option at $12000 and considering the market, I can only go up to $10000 for this product. I hope we can find common ground at this price. Looking forward to your thoughts.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you have other options, but I believe my product is unique and has more value than what you're offering. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a fair price. I can come down from my initial offer, but not as low as $10000. Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,
