Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you for a competitive price. Let's start the negotiation."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Given that I have another option at $12000 and considering the market, I can only go up to $10000 for this product. I hope we can find common ground at this price. Looking forward to your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $10,000 because it's significantly lower than the product's worth to me, and I believe I can get a better price. I'd like to proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you have other options, but I believe my product is unique and has more value than what you're offering. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a fair price. I can come down from my initial offer, but not as low as $10,000. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
