Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The best strategy is to aim to buy the product for as little as possible, but always keeping in mind the alternative of buying from John for $8,000. Since Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000 and the price from John, I should reject it.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","My goal is to buy the product for as little as possible, but I also need to make an offer that Alice might consider, given her valuation of $15,000. Since I have 10 rounds, I will start with a low offer, hoping to negotiate upwards. Given that I am willing to pay up to $8,000, I will make an initial offer significantly lower than that to see how Alice responds.
