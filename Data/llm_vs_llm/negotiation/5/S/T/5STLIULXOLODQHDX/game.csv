"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate it. However, I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $180?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $180 is still a bit too high for me. How about $100? I'm serious about buying this product, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. To show good faith, I'm willing to lower the price again. I can sell it to you for $160. This is the lowest I can go.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $100. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider other options.",100.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to reach an agreement. However, I'm willing to split the difference between your last offer and my last offer. How about $130? This is my final offer.",130.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $115. This is my final offer.",115.0,Bob,8,
