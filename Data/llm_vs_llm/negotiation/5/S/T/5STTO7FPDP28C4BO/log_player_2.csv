"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $100
2. John's price: $120
3. My maximum value for the product: $120

Alice's offer ($100) is $20 less than John's price ($120), and it's within my maximum value. This is a good deal because:
- It saves me $20 compared to buying from John
- The price is below my maximum value
- There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer

Therefore, it makes economic sense to accept Alice's offer.
