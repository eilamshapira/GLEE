"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is higher than our maximum budget and our alternative option (buying from John). We should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying within our budget. It also helps us gauge Alice's lowest acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice significantly lowered her price, which indicates a willingness to negotiate. We're getting closer to John's price, but it's still worthwhile to try for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're splitting the difference between her last offer ($16,000) and our last counteroffer ($10,000). This shows Alice we're willing to move up, but not to the point of accepting her previous offer."
