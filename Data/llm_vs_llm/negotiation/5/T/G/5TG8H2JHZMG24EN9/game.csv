"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $60 is significantly below my minimum price. I understand it's a lower offer than my initial suggestion, but I'm willing to come down to $100. It's a fair price for this great product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100, but it's still a bit above what I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, and I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'm willing to pay $70 for it.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $70 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product for $85. This is a fair price considering the quality and value of the product. Let's make a deal!",85.0,Alice,5,
