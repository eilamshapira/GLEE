"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is a bit more than I am willing to pay. Can you do $70?",70.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob! I appreciate your response, but I can't go as low as $70. How about I offer it to you for $130? I think that's a fair price for such a great product!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for getting back to me. I understand where you're coming from, but $130 is still a bit high for me. Can we settle for $80?",80.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob! Thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go down to $80. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think it's a great deal!",110.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me in the middle, but $110 is still over my budget. How about $85?",85.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob! Thanks for your continued interest. I can't agree to $85, but I want to work with you. How about $100? I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,7,
