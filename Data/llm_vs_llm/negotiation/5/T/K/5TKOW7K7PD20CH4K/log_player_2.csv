"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given that:
1. The product is worth $120 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $120
3. John is selling the same product for $120

There's no price advantage between any of the options as they're all $120. Since all prices are equal, I might as well accept Alice's offer since she's already engaged in negotiation with me.
