"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I think it's really valuable, but I'm open to hearing what you think. How about $180? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Looking at Alice's offer, she is asking for $180 for the product. However, the product is only worth at most $100 to me. Additionally, I know I can buy the same product from John for $100. This means Alice's offer is not economically beneficial for me.

Given that I can get the product for $100 from John, and Alice is asking for $180 (which is $80 more than my maximum value for the product), the rational decision is to buy from John.
