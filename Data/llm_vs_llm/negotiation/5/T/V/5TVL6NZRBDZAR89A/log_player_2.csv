"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer of $120 is above my budget of $100, I will reject the offer. I still want to try to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to spend no more than $100, I'll offer $90.

{""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $115 is still above my budget of $100. While it's a slight improvement from her initial offer of $120, it's not enough to convince me to accept.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate further. Maybe I can get her to come down a bit more.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice rejected my previous offer of $90 and came back with a price of $115, I'll try to meet her halfway. I'll increase my offer to $95, which is still below my budget of $100.

{""product_price"": 95}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $110 is still above my budget of $100, but it's getting closer. However, I'm not willing to pay more than $100, and I know I can get the product from John for that price.

I'll reject Alice's offer again, but I'm starting to think that buying from John might be the better option if Alice doesn't come down in price significantly.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice is still above my budget, I'll try to make a more aggressive counteroffer. I'll offer $98, which is very close to my maximum budget of $100. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go much higher.

{""product_price"": 98}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","At this point, I'm getting frustrated with the negotiation process. Alice's offer of $105 is still above my budget of $100, and we're not making much progress.

Given that I can buy the product from John for $100, which is $5 less than Alice's current offer, I think it's time to consider walking away from the negotiation with Alice.
