Send your offer to Bob.,"Since I know the product is worth at least $10,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a higher price to test Bob's willingness to pay.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's counteroffer of $12,000 is actually quite good - it's $2,000 more than John's guaranteed offer of $10,000. While I could try to negotiate for an even higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's lower offer. Since $12,000 is a solid improvement over my guaranteed alternative, I'll accept Bob's offer.
