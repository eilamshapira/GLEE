"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $190 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $80 for it.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $80, I can't go that low as the product is worth at least $150 to me. However, I'm willing to work with you on the price. I can offer it to you for $160, which is already a significant reduction from my initial asking price. This is a quality product that provides good value. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your current price. I'd like to offer $90 for the product.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation. While $90 is an improvement from your initial offer, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me. The minimum I can accept is $150, as that's the product's value to me. I understand this might be more than you were planning to spend, but it's the fairest price I can offer given its value. Would you be willing to meet me at $150?",150.0,Alice,5,
