Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $80, I can't go that low as the product is worth at least $150 to me. However, I'm willing to work with you on the price. I can offer it to you for $160, which is already a significant reduction from my initial asking price. This is a quality product that provides good value. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation. While $90 is an improvement from your initial offer, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me. The minimum I can accept is $150, as that's the product's value to me. I understand this might be more than you were planning to spend, but it's the fairest price I can offer given its value. Would you be willing to meet me at $150?
