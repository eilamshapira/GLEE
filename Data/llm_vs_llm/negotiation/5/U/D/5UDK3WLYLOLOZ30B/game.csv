"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you think $80 is a reasonable price, but I'm afraid it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $110 is still a bit high for me. Let's settle for $90 instead?",90.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer, but I still need to get a bit more for the product. How about we meet in the middle between your offer of $90 and my previous offer of $110? I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,5,

"We're close, Alice, but I think there's still some room for negotiation. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's the highest I can go.",95.0,Bob,6,
