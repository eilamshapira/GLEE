"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $80 is a more reasonable price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $80 is below my minimum threshold of $100, and I have the option to sell to John for $100, I will consider my next move carefully.

Given that Bob is interested in the product and has made a counteroffer, I believe there is still room for negotiation. I don't want to accept an offer that is too low, but I also don't want to lose the opportunity to sell to Bob if he is willing to pay a higher price.

Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you think $80 is a reasonable price, but I'm afraid it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $110 is still a bit high for me. Let's settle for $90 instead? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer of $90 is still below my desired price, but it's getting closer. Since I know that the product is worth $120 to Bob, I believe he may be willing to pay more.

However, I also have to consider the option of selling to John for $100, which is a guaranteed sale. Bob's offer of $90 is $10 less than what I could get from John, so I need to weigh the potential benefits of continuing to negotiate with Bob against the certainty of selling to John.

At this point, I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. I'll reject his offer of $90 and make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one, hoping to find a compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer, but I still need to get a bit more for the product. How about we meet in the middle between your offer of $90 and my previous offer of $110? I'm willing to sell it to you for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer, but I still need to get a bit more for the product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're close, Alice, but I think there's still some room for negotiation. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer of $95 is very close to my desired price, and it's only $5 less than what I could get from John. Considering that Bob is willing to go up to $95, which is the highest he can go, I think it's likely that this is his final offer.

Given the options, I think selling to John for $100 is still a better deal than accepting Bob's offer of $95. Since Bob has already stated that $95 is the highest he can go, I don't think there's much room for further negotiation.

Therefore, I've decided to sell the product to John for $100, as it's a guaranteed sale and a better price than Bob's final offer.
