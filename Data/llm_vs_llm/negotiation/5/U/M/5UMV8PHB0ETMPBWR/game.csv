"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm starting the conversation at $25000.",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $25000 is significantly above my budget. I've actually researched the market value of this product, and I can get it from another seller for $15000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $12000 for the product, which would save me a bit compared to my alternative while still giving you a sale. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $12000 is too low. I can't accept that. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $22000?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for being willing to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate you lowering your price, but $22000 is still significantly more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I have another option to purchase this exact product for $15000. I value our potential business relationship, so I'm willing to meet you at $13500. This gives you a better deal than my first offer while still making sense for my budget compared to my alternative option. Does that work for you?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $13500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Considering that you have another option at $15000, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go that low. My final offer is $16000. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,5,
