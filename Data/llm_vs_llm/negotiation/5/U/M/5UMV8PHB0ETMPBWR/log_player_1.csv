Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $25000 is significantly above my budget. I've actually researched the market value of this product, and I can get it from another seller for $15000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $12000 for the product, which would save me a bit compared to my alternative while still giving you a sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for being willing to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate you lowering your price, but $22000 is still significantly more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I have another option to purchase this exact product for $15000. I value our potential business relationship, so I'm willing to meet you at $13500. This gives you a better deal than my first offer while still making sense for my budget compared to my alternative option. Does that work for you?
