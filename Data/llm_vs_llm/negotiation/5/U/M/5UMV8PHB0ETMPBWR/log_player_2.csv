"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm starting the conversation at $25000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given the information provided:

1. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to you.
2. Alice is offering it for $25,000, which is $10,000 more than its worth to you.
3. John is offering the same product for $15,000, which is exactly its maximum value to you.

Alice's price is significantly higher than both the product's worth to you and John's alternative offer. Since the product is available from John at exactly your maximum valuation, there's no reason to pay more to Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $25,000 is significantly above my budget. I've actually researched the market value of this product, and I can get it from another seller for $15,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for the product, which would save me a bit compared to my alternative while still giving you a sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $12000 is too low. I can't accept that. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $22000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has dropped her price from $25,000 to $22,000, which shows some flexibility. However, this is still $7,000 more than the product is worth to me, and $7,000 more than John's offer of $15,000.

Since I can get the same product from John for $15,000, which matches the maximum value the product has to me, there's no reason to accept Alice's higher price of $22,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for being willing to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate you lowering your price, but $22,000 is still significantly more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, I have another option to purchase this exact product for $15,000. I value our potential business relationship, so I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This gives you a better deal than my first offer while still making sense for my budget compared to my alternative option. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $13500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Considering that you have another option at $15000, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go that low. My final offer is $16000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has now lowered her price to $16,000, which is just $1,000 more than John's offer of $15,000. However, since the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and I can purchase it from John for exactly that amount, it still doesn't make financial sense to accept Alice's offer.

John's offering price perfectly matches my maximum valuation, so I should go with that option.
