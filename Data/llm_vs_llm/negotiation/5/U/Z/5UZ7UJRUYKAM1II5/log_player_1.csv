Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $11,500, which I think is a fair price considering its quality and value."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  This is still a good deal for you, and it would be a great deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. The price he's offering is too close to my minimum value, and I know the product is worth more to him. I'll try to negotiate for a better price.

Let me respond with a new offer: {""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, I need to get a better price for this product. I can come down to $11,000, which is still a good value considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, I need to get a better price for this product. I can come down to $11,000, which is still a good value considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10750. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $10,750. While it's lower than my initial target, it's still $750 more than what John is offering, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob as a buyer. This price gives me a reasonable profit while also giving Bob a fair deal, considering the product's value to him."
