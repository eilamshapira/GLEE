Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 15000}

Since the product is worth $15,000 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay that amount, there's no reason for me to offer Bob a lower price. If Bob accepts, I get $15,000, and if he rejects, I still get $15,000 from John. This maximizes my earnings regardless of Bob's decision."
