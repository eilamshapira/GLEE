"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,200,000 for the product, and John is offering exactly $1,200,000, the logical choice is to buy from John.
