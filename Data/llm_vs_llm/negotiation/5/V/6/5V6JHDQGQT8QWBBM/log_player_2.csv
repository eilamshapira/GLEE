"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you an exclusive deal on this one-of-a-kind product for just $119. Since I have another buyer ready at $80, I’d love for you to take advantage of this offer. Let me know if you’re in! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me evaluate this offer carefully:

Alice's offer: $119
John's price: $120
My maximum value for the product: $120

Analysis:
- Alice's offer is $1 less than John's price.
- The product is worth $80 to Alice, but that doesn't change what it's worth to me.
- If I reject Alice's offer, my only option is to buy from John at $120.
- By accepting Alice's offer, I save $1 compared to buying from John.

While the savings is minimal ($1), it's still financially better to accept Alice's offer since I'm looking to save as much money as possible while still getting the product.
