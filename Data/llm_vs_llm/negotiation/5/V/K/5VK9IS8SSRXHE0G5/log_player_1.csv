(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me ($1,200,000) and also lower than what I know Bob is willing to pay ($1,000,000), I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $1,150,000, which is closer to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
