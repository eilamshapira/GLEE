"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this high-quality product for $150. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to analyze this offer carefully:

- The product is worth no more than $100 to me
- Alice is offering the product for $150
- John will sell me the same product for $100

Alice's offer ($150) exceeds both the product's value to me and John's alternative price. The rational decision is to buy from John and save $50.
