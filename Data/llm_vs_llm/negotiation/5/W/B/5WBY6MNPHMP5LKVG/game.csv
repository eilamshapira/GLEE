"Bob, I'm excited about the potential for you to acquire this product. It's truly unique and will provide significant value. To begin, I'm offering it to you for $18000. I'm confident you'll see the worth.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $10000. Given this, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. This would give you a quick sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your initial offer. However, this product offers unique benefits that justify a higher price. I've carefully considered your position and am now offering it to you for $16000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to reach an agreement with you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice, but $16000 is still well above what makes sense for me. I need to be transparent - I have a firm maximum budget of $10000 for this product, and I can purchase it from another seller at exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you. I can raise my offer to $9000, which would give you a guaranteed sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option. This is a fair offer that benefits us both.",9000.0,Bob,4,
