"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited about the potential for you to acquire this product. It's truly unique and will provide significant value. To begin, I'm offering it to you for $18,000. I'm confident you'll see the worth."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $10000. Given this, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. This would give you a quick sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is too low. The product is worth significantly more than that, and I have a baseline price I need to meet. I'm willing to come down somewhat, but not that much. My counteroffer is $16,000."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your initial offer. However, this product offers unique benefits that justify a higher price. I've carefully considered your position and am now offering it to you for $16,000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to reach an agreement with you."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice, but $16000 is still well above what makes sense for me. I need to be transparent - I have a firm maximum budget of $10000 for this product, and I can purchase it from another seller at exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you. I can raise my offer to $9000, which would give you a guaranteed sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option. This is a fair offer that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
