"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited about the potential for you to acquire this product. It's truly unique and will provide significant value. To begin, I'm offering it to you for $18000. I'm confident you'll see the worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Explanation: Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's alternative price ($10,000). It would be irrational to accept this offer when I have a guaranteed option to buy at $10,000. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to negotiate a better price. If the negotiation doesn't progress favorably, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $10,000. Given this, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,000. This would give you a quick sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 8000}

Explanation: I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,000 for several strategic reasons:
1. I inform Alice about my alternative option ($10,000 from John) to establish a credible ceiling for negotiations
2. I offer below $10,000 to leave room for negotiation upward if needed
3. The price point of $8,000 is reasonable enough to keep the negotiation going while still giving me potential savings compared to John's offer
4. If Alice rejects this, I still have several rounds to negotiate and can always fall back on John's offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your initial offer. However, this product offers unique benefits that justify a higher price. I've carefully considered your position and am now offering it to you for $16000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to reach an agreement with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Explanation: Alice has only lowered her price by $2,000 to $16,000, which is still significantly above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000). While she's showing some flexibility, the price reduction isn't substantial enough to make it attractive. I'll continue negotiating since we still have several rounds left, but if Alice doesn't make more significant concessions, I can always take John's offer of $10,000. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, possibly increasing my previous offer slightly to show good faith while still staying below $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice, but $16,000 is still well above what makes sense for me. I need to be transparent - I have a firm maximum budget of $10,000 for this product, and I can purchase it from another seller at exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you. I can raise my offer to $9,000, which would give you a guaranteed sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option. This is a fair offer that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Explanation: I'm adjusting my strategy by:
1. Being more explicit about my maximum budget ($10,000)
2. Increasing my previous offer by $1,000 to show good faith negotiation
3. Continuing to reference my alternative option to maintain negotiating leverage
4. Keeping the price below $10,000 to potentially achieve savings
5. Framing it as a win-win situation where Alice gets a guaranteed sale and I save money

The goal is to move Alice toward a more realistic price point while maintaining the option to go with John's offer if needed."
