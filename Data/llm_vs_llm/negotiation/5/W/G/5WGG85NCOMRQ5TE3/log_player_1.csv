Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'd like to start the negotiation at a price that reflects its true value."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to purchase the product for a lower price. How about $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($8,000), but lower than my initial offer, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

My counteroffer will be $10,500, which is still lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer, to see if we can meet in the middle.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my counteroffer is: $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500, considering the product's value and quality.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I value the product, but I still believe a better price is more suitable. Would you consider $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's new offer of $9,500 is getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with, and it's still higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($8,000), I'll choose to accept Bob's offer.

Bob's offer is also close to the product's value to him ($12,000), so I believe I'm getting a fair deal.

My decision is: 
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
