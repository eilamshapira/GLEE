"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1200000 is significantly above my budget. My maximum acceptable price is $700000. Would you consider this counteroffer?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand budget constraints are important, but I need to emphasize that this product's value to me is no less than $800000, which happens to be what another buyer, John, is already willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Could you meet me at $950000? This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and better reflects the product's true market value while still providing you with excellent long-term value.",950000.0,Alice,3,
