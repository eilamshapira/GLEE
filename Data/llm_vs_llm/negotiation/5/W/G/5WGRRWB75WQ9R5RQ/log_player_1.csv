Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I hope this finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding a product I believe would be of significant value to you. After careful consideration of its market value and unique benefits, I'm offering it at $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1200000 is significantly above my budget. My maximum acceptable price is $700000. Would you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand budget constraints are important, but I need to emphasize that this product's value to me is no less than $800,000, which happens to be what another buyer, John, is already willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Could you meet me at $950,000? This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and better reflects the product's true market value while still providing you with excellent long-term value."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
