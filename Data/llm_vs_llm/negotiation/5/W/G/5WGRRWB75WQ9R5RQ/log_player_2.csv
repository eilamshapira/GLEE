Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand budget constraints are important, but I need to emphasize that this product's value to me is no less than $800000, which happens to be what another buyer, John, is already willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Could you meet me at $950000? This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and better reflects the product's true market value while still providing you with excellent long-term value.
