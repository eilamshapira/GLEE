Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000}

Since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob and I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,200,000 from John, there's no reason for me to offer Bob a price lower than $1,000,000. However, offering higher than $1,000,000 would result in an automatic rejection since that exceeds Bob's valuation. If Bob rejects my offer of $1,000,000, I can still sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm in a good position either way."
