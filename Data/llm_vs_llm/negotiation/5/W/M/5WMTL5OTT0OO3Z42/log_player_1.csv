"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target price. $100 is too low for me, and I think I can get a better deal from Bob or sell it to John for $150 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I can try to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price, but I still need to get a fair value for the product. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 145}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $145, but it's still a bit high for me. Could you go any lower? How about $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. $110 is still too low, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob or sell it to John for $150. I'll try to meet Bob halfway again, but I won't go as low as $110. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer of $140."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. I've thought about your offer, and I can come down a bit more. However, I still need to get a good price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for lowering the price to $140. I'm trying to stay within my budget. Could you consider $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

$115 is still too low, and I'm not willing to sell the product at a loss. I'll make another counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground. Since Bob is willing to increase his offer, I'll decrease mine, but not too much. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer of $138."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've thought about your offer, and I can come down a bit more. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $138, which is a very competitive price. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 138}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, $138 is still a bit high for me. Could you go down to $120? That would really help me stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $120 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's the 8th round, I don't want to risk losing the sale. Accepting $120 is better than potentially going back and forth a few more times and ending up with a lower price or no sale at all. Additionally, it's worth noting that $120 is the maximum value Bob has for the product, so it's unlikely he'll go higher. Given the circumstances, accepting the offer of $120 seems like the best option."
