"Alice,  I appreciate your offer but $10500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $9000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $9000 is lower than what I can accept given the product's value. I can come down to $9800, which I believe is a fair price that works for both of us.",9800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9800 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9000. It's a fair price, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
