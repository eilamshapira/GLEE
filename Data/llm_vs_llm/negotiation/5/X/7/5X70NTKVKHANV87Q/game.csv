"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $18000. It's a real steal, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $4000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $4000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $15000.  This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's try to find a middle ground.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $15000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $5500. I believe this is a reasonable price, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",5500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $5500 is still far too low. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is a significant compromise on my part. If you're genuinely interested in the product, let's meet in the middle at this price. ",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $6500. I believe this is a fair price, considering we're both trying to find a mutually agreeable deal.",6500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your persistence, $6500 is still well below the product's worth.  Let's meet in the middle again - I'm willing to lower the price to $9000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to compromise. However, $9000 is still slightly above what I'm willing to pay. Considering John is offering the same product for $8000, I'm willing to meet you at $7500. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to close the deal.",7500.0,Bob,8,
