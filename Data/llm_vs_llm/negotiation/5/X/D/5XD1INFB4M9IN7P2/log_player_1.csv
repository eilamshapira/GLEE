Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob for the product.

Given the situation, I'll analyze the best price to offer:
- The product is worth at least $100 to me
- The product is worth $120 to Bob
- If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for $100

Since Bob values the product at $120, I should offer a price below that to give him incentive to buy. However, I want to maximize my profit. If I offer slightly less than $120, Bob should accept since he still gets value from the purchase.
