"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $115
2. John's price: $120
3. My maximum value: $120

Alice's offer ($115) is better than John's price ($120), saving me $5. Since the product is worth up to $120 for me, and Alice's offer is below that, it makes economic sense to accept her offer.
