"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice is offering the product for $180, which is significantly above the $120 that the product is worth to me. Since John is willing to sell me the same product for $120 (which is my maximum value for the product), it makes no sense to accept Alice's offer of $180.

I could make a counteroffer to Alice, but since John is already offering exactly my maximum value, I'm better off just purchasing from John directly rather than continuing a potentially lengthy negotiation with Alice.
