"Hello Bob, I have a premium product for sale that I believe would be valuable to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18000. This is a competitive price for a product of this caliber. Are you interested?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $10000? I believe this price still reflects the quality while being more aligned with my financial constraints.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $10000 is actually my absolute minimum price point as that's what I've been offered elsewhere. Given the quality and value of this product, I could come down to $16000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This product has exceptional features and durability that justify this price point. Would you be able to meet me at this price?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I understand the value of the product, but $16000 is still beyond what I can commit to. How about $11000? I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your offer of $11000. We're getting closer, but I'm still not able to go that low considering the product's value. I can come down to $14500, which is a substantial reduction from my original price. This product offers exceptional quality and features that make it worth this investment. Could you meet me at this price point?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your patience and the revised offer. I understand we're getting closer, but I'm really trying to make sure this purchase fits within my budget. Would you consider $12500? This is stretching a bit for me, but I think it's a fair compromise.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your continued interest and for stretching your budget. I can see you're serious about purchasing this product. I've considered your offer of $12500, and I can meet you partway at $13500. This is significantly below my initial price and represents excellent value for such a high-quality product. This is very close to the lowest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me. Can we agree on $13500?",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $13500, and the effort to find common ground. My budget is quite tight, however. How about $12000? This is the best I can do considering my financial limits, and I hope it still works for you.",12000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your candor about your budget constraints and your continued interest in the product. After careful consideration of your $12000 offer, I can come down to $13000 as my final price. This represents a $5000 reduction from my initial offer and is truly the best I can do while still maintaining the value proposition of this premium product. At this price point, you're getting exceptional quality and features that will serve you well. Can we finalize the deal at $13000?",13000.0,Alice,9,
