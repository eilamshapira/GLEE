You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer is $100, which is the same price as John's offer and equal to my maximum valuation, it would be better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. If the negotiation fails, I can always buy from John at $100 later.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low that it would be considered unreasonable.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice is still firm at $100 and not showing flexibility, and this price equals both John's price and my maximum valuation, I'll try one more counteroffer before considering other options. There's no downside to trying another negotiation round.
