"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth at least $800,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a relatively high offer to test Bob's willingness to pay.

{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is better than John's guaranteed $800,000, and there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away if I push too hard, I'll accept this offer. The $100,000 premium over John's offer is a reasonable outcome.
