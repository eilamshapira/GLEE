"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($1,500,000) and John's alternative offer ($1,500,000). It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer when I can either negotiate for a better price or buy from John at a lower price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'll offer $1,200,000 to Alice. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation because:
1. It's below John's price of $1,500,000, giving me room to negotiate upward if needed
2. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, this offer might still be appealing as it would allow her to make some profit
3. If Alice rejects this offer, we can continue negotiating, and I still have John's offer as a backup"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John because:
1. John's price ($1,500,000) is better than Alice's current offer ($1,750,000)
2. Alice's latest offer is still significantly above John's price, and even though we could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will go below $1,500,000
3. John's price matches my maximum valuation, so it's a fair deal
4. Continuing negotiations with Alice might be time-consuming and could still end up with a higher price than John's offer

It's more rational to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 rather than continue negotiating with Alice when she's still asking for $250,000 more than John's price."
