"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2000000 is higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is lower. Would you consider $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $1200000 is below our minimum acceptable price. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1800000. What do you think?",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the value of this product justifies a higher investment. I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1700000 is still above what I can justify. My maximum is $1300000.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I see that we're still a bit apart on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1600000? This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and your budget constraints. Let me know what you think.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Let's try to close the gap further. I'm willing to lower the price to $1550000. This is very close to my minimum, and I believe it's a strong offer given the product's value. What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
