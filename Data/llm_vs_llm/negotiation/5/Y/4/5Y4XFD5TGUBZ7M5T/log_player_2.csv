"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice's offer is way too high. We can definitely negotiate a better price or buy it from John for much less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

This is a starting point. It's less than half of Alice's initial offer and well below John's price. Let's see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice came down a bit, but it's still too high. We're getting closer to John's price, but there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

We're increasing our offer, but still staying well below Alice's last offer and John's price. This should signal that we're willing to negotiate, but not at any cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, but we're still not there yet. We need to start pushing closer to John's price to increase the pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

Now we're getting close. This is a strong offer, just slightly below John's price. It puts pressure on Alice while leaving us with a good alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

This is getting very close to a point where accepting might be the best move. However, with still a few rounds left, we have room to push Alice a little bit further down.  We are aiming for the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

This is a slight increase from our last offer, showing Alice we are willing to move, but we're still holding firm closer to John's price. It's a calculated risk with only a few rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

This is a good deal! We've managed to get the price down significantly from Alice's initial offer. While we could try to push for an even lower price, we risk Alice backing out and losing the opportunity to save $2,500 compared to John's price."
