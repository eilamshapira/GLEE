"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation.  $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $175? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Since Bob is willing to pay $175, I'll try to meet him halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer.

My counteroffer: $187.50 

Let's see how Bob responds to this new price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $175. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit above that price point, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet at $187.50?"", ""product_price"": 187.50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $187.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $181.25? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $181.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $181.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I think $181.25 is a reasonable price, and it's getting close to the point where I might not get a better offer from Bob. Since it's still above my minimum price of $120, I'm willing to accept this offer and finalize the sale with Bob."
