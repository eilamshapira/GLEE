"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the premium quality of your product, I find the price of $1200000 to be significantly above my budget. I have another seller offering a similar product for $800000. However, I'm interested in working with you if we can find a middle ground. I would like to make a counteroffer of $700000, which I believe is fair considering the market conditions.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your counteroffer. However, I need to point out that $700000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I understand you mentioned another seller at $800000, and I'd like to clarify that my product offers superior quality and features compared to competitors. Given this, I'm willing to reduce my asking price to $950000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of this premium product. This price is competitive when you consider the long-term benefits and returns you'll receive.",950000.0,Alice,3,
