Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the premium quality of your product, I find the price of $1200000 to be significantly above my budget. I have another seller offering a similar product for $800000. However, I'm interested in working with you if we can find a middle ground. I would like to make a counteroffer of $700000, which I believe is fair considering the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your counteroffer. However, I need to point out that $700,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I understand you mentioned another seller at $800,000, and I'd like to clarify that my product offers superior quality and features compared to competitors. Given this, I'm willing to reduce my asking price to $950,000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of this premium product. This price is competitive when you consider the long-term benefits and returns you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
