Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your counteroffer. However, I need to point out that $700000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I understand you mentioned another seller at $800000, and I'd like to clarify that my product offers superior quality and features compared to competitors. Given this, I'm willing to reduce my asking price to $950000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of this premium product. This price is competitive when you consider the long-term benefits and returns you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
