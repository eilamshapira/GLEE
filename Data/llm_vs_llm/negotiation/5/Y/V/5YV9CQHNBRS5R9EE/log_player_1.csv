Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","$12,000 is a decent offer, significantly above my minimum price of $10,000, but since this is only round 2 and Bob has already shown willingness to negotiate up from $10,000, I believe I can get a better price.

Let me make a counteroffer of $15,000 to continue the negotiation.
