"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully. She's offering the product for $18,000, but I know that:
1. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
2. I can buy the same product from John for $15,000

Since Alice's offer of $18,000 exceeds both the maximum value to me and John's alternative price, it doesn't make sense to accept it. I should either negotiate with Alice or go with John's offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice that's reasonable but still gives me room to negotiate if needed.

{""product_price"": $12,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has now offered the product for $15,000, which is exactly the same price that John is offering and matches the maximum value the product has to me.

At this point, I have no incentive to continue negotiating since:
1. Alice is offering the product at my maximum value ($15,000)
2. This matches John's alternative price ($15,000)
3. Further negotiation might not yield a better price and could risk losing the deal

The rational choice is to accept Alice's offer since it meets my constraints and there's no clear advantage to choosing John over Alice at the same price.
