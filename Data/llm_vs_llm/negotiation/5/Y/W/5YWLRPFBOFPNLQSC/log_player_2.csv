"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $1,500,000 is higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($800,000), it doesn't make sense to accept it. Additionally, I have the option to buy from John for $800,000, which is my maximum budget, but I'd like to try negotiating with Alice first to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price.

Therefore, my decision is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Alice a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'll start by making a relatively low counteroffer. I'll offer $600,000, which is below my maximum budget of $800,000. This gives us room for negotiation and allows Alice to consider my offer.
