"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The rational choice here is to buy from John for $8,000 because:
1. Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000
2. Even if I make a counteroffer, Alice is unlikely to go below $15,000 since that's what the product is worth to her
3. John's price of $8,000 matches my maximum valuation and represents a fair deal
4. Continuing negotiations with Alice would likely be futile given the large gap between our valuations"
