"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, I believe we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. Given that I have multiple options available, including another seller, I would like to offer $1050000 for the product.

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, however, $1050000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1125000.  This price reflects the worth of this unique product while still providing you with a significant return on your investment.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. Your product is valuable, but I need to ensure I'm making a sound investment.

This is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1085000.0,Bob,4,
