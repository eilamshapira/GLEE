"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. If you're interested, please consider my offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $20,000
3. John is offering the same product for $10,000

I would choose to buy from John because:
- Alice's price ($20,000) is significantly higher than my maximum value ($10,000)
- John's price ($10,000) matches my maximum value
- There's no reason to pay $20,000 for something worth $10,000 to me
