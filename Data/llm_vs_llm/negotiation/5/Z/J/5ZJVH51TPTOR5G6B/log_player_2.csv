"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $1,200,000
3. John is willing to sell it for $800,000

Since Alice's offer ($1,200,000) is significantly higher than both:
- The product's worth to me ($800,000)
- John's offer ($800,000)

The logical choice is to buy from John and get the best deal.
