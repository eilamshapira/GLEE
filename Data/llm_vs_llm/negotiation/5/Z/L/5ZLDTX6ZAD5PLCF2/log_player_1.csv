"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth at least $10,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at $10,000, I'll start with a high initial offer to test Bob's willingness to pay and leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","I will reject Bob's offer of $5,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 (John's guaranteed offer), but I'll continue negotiating with Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let me make a counteroffer of $17,500, lowering the price somewhat but still maintaining a good margin above my minimum.

{""product_price"": 17500}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's second offer of $6,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Since Bob has only increased his offer by $1,000 (from $5,000 to $6,000), it seems he might not be willing to reach my minimum price. However, I'll give it one more try with a lower counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let me make a counteroffer of $15,000, showing more flexibility but still maintaining a good margin above my minimum.

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offers are increasing very slowly ($5,000 → $6,000 → $7,000), and we're already in round 6 out of 10. Given that:
1. Bob's current offer ($7,000) is still well below my minimum acceptable price ($10,000)
2. The pattern of his offers suggests he's unlikely to reach $10,000
3. I have a guaranteed offer from John at $10,000
4. We've already used more than half of our available rounds

It's time to end the negotiation with Bob and take John's guaranteed offer.
