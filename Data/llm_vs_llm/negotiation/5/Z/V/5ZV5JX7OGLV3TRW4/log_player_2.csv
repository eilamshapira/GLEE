"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it will be a great fit for you. I can offer it to you for $14000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000), it would not be rational to accept this offer. While I could reject and make a counteroffer, since John's price is already at my maximum value point, and Alice's initial offer is so high (suggesting she's unlikely to drop the price dramatically), the best decision would be to buy from John.
