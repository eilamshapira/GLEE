# Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","The product is worth no more than $150 to me. Alice's initial offer of $300 is way too high. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a lower price. Buying from John for $150 is an option, but I'll explore negotiating with Alice first to see if I can get a better deal.
