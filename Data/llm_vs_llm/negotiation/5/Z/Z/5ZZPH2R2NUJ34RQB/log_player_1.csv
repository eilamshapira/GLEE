Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price that Bob will accept while maximizing my profit. The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so that's his upper limit. If he rejects my offer, I'll sell to John for $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable amount.

Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, I should offer a price that gives him some value while still being significantly better for me than my alternative of $1,200,000. If I price too close to $1,500,000, Bob might reject the offer.

A reasonable approach would be to set a price that splits some of the surplus between us, but leaning more in my favor:

{""product_price"": 1400000}"
