"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is significantly above my budget. I can offer $600000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to lower my price to $1000000, which I believe is a fair compromise. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $1000000 is still beyond what I can justify for this product. I can increase my offer to $700000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer and reflects the maximum value I can reasonably offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your increased offer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $850000? This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer while still recognizing the high value of the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
