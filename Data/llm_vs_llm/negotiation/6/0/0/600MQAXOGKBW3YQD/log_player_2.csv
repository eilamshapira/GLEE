"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product at a special price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's alternative price ($800,000). It would be rational to reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. If the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory price, I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I can offer $600,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions."", ""product_price"": 600000}

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer of $600,000 because:
1. It's well below my maximum value of $800,000, giving room for negotiation
2. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, allowing space for us to meet somewhere in the middle
3. Even if Alice counters higher, I still have John's offer of $800,000 as a backup
4. Starting low gives me better negotiating position while still being a reasonable offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to lower my price to $1000000, which I believe is a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice has reduced her price by $200,000, the offered price of $1,000,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's alternative price ($800,000). There's no reason to accept this offer when I have a guaranteed better option with John. However, I'll reject and make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a more reasonable price before potentially taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is still beyond what I can justify for this product. I can increase my offer to $700,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer and reflects the maximum value I can reasonably offer."", ""product_price"": 700000}

I'm offering $700,000 because:
1. It shows meaningful movement from my initial offer of $600,000, demonstrating good faith negotiation
2. It's still below John's price of $800,000, giving me room to maneuver
3. It's below my maximum value of $800,000
4. If Alice rejects this offer, I can either make one final attempt or simply go with John's offer
5. The $700,000 price point leaves some room for a final negotiation while still being a serious offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your increased offer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $850000? This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer while still recognizing the high value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John because:
1. Alice's latest offer ($850,000) is still above John's price ($800,000)
2. Alice's offer is also above my maximum value ($800,000)
3. While we've made progress in negotiations, there's no reason to pay more than $800,000 when I have a guaranteed option at that price
4. Even if we continue negotiating, it seems unlikely that Alice will go below $800,000 given her current position
5. It's time to end the negotiation and take the sure deal with John that meets my needs and budget"
