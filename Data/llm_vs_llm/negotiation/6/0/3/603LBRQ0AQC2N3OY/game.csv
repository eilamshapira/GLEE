"Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $15000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $13500. It's a fair price, and I believe we can both be happy with this deal.",13500.0,Bob,4,
