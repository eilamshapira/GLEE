While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I've already spent several rounds negotiating. I'm concerned that we might not reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.  To avoid the risk of getting stuck in an endless negotiation, I'll buy the product from John for $15,000. It's the best option for me at this point."
