"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12000 is beyond my budget. Considering market alternatives and my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $6000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. $6,000 is too low as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Let me send a new offer to Bob that's more reasonable while still maintaining room for negotiation.

{
""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $6,000 is significantly below the product's value. I can reduce my initial price to $11,000, which is a substantial reduction and represents good value for this product."",
""product_price"": 11000
}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{
""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $6,000 is significantly below the product's value. I can reduce my initial price to $11,000, which is a substantial reduction and represents good value for this product."",
""product_price"": 11000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for reconsidering, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I also have to stay within my budget. How about we settle at $7000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll take John's offer of $10,000. Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and given that the product is worth $8,000 to him, it's unlikely he'll increase his offer significantly above $8,000. John's offer of $10,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, making it the best business decision."
