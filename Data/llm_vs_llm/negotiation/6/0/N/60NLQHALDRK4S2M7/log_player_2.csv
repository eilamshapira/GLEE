Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm willing to pay up to $12,000, I'll offer a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to leave room for negotiation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous offer, but still lower than Alice's current offer. This will show that I'm willing to negotiate and meet Alice halfway.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous offer, but still lower than Alice's current offer. I'll try to meet Alice closer to the middle, while still being mindful of my maximum budget of $12,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $12,500 is very close to my maximum budget of $12,000, but it's still slightly higher. At this point, I have to consider that buying from John for $12,000 is a better option than accepting Alice's offer. Since I can get the product for $12,000 from John, which is lower than Alice's current offer, I'll choose to buy from John instead of continuing to negotiate with Alice.
