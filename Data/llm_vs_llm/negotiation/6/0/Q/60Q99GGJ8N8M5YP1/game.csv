"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $6000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $13000.",13000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle, but $13000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $7000? I'm trying to be mindful of my spending.",7000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I understand you are mindful of your spending. However, selling the product for $7000 would mean a significant loss for me. How about $12500? This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",12500.0,Alice,5,,
