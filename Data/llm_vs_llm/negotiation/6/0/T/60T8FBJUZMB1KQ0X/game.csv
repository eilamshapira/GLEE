"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is well above my budget. Given my market research and available alternatives, I can offer $800000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the current market value, and I hope we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I must say that $800000 is a bit lower than I was expecting. Considering the product's value and the price I can get from other buyers, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you the product for $2200000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I hope this is more in line with your budget and expectations.",2200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $2200000 is still substantially above my budget. I understand the value of your product, but I need to be practical about my spending limits. I can increase my offer to $900000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering your budget constraints and my own requirements, I'm willing to make a significant concession. I can offer you the product for $1800000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial price. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the product's value and your spending limits. I'm open to further discussions, but I hope this offer brings us closer to a mutually acceptable agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
