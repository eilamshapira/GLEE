"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $2,500,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2500000 is well above my budget. Given my market research and available alternatives, I can offer $800000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the current market value, and I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

My reasoning is that Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and even lower than the price I can get from John. I believe there's room for negotiation and I can try to get a better price from Bob. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round to try to find a mutually acceptable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I must say that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was expecting. Considering the product's value and the price I can get from other buyers, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you the product for $2,200,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I hope this is more in line with your budget and expectations."", ""product_price"": 2200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $2200000 is still substantially above my budget. I understand the value of your product, but I need to be practical about my spending limits. I can increase my offer to $900000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

My reasoning is that Bob's offer of $900,000 is still lower than the price I can get from John, and I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better price from Bob. Since Bob has increased his offer, I'll try to meet him halfway between my previous offer and his current offer to see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering your budget constraints and my own requirements, I'm willing to make a significant concession. I can offer you the product for $1,800,000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial price. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the product's value and your spending limits. I'm open to further discussions, but I hope this offer brings us closer to a mutually acceptable agreement."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
