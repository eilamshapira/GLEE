"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $2500000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $2,500,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum budget ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), it would be reasonable to reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,500,000 is well above my budget. Given my market research and available alternatives, I can offer $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the current market value, and I hope we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I must say that $800000 is a bit lower than I was expecting. Considering the product's value and the price I can get from other buyers, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you the product for $2200000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I hope this is more in line with your budget and expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $2,200,000 is still significantly above both my maximum budget ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000). While Alice did reduce the price, it's still more than twice what I can afford or am willing to pay. Given that I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000 and Alice seems to be making only small reductions while staying well above my maximum price, it would be wise to reject and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still maintain a price well below my maximum budget, showing some flexibility while keeping room for further negotiation.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice, but $2,200,000 is still substantially above my budget. I understand the value of your product, but I need to be practical about my spending limits. I can increase my offer to $900,000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering your budget constraints and my own requirements, I'm willing to make a significant concession. I can offer you the product for $1800000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial price. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the product's value and your spending limits. I'm open to further discussions, but I hope this offer brings us closer to a mutually acceptable agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is still well above both my maximum budget ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000). While Alice continues to make reductions, we're now in round 5 out of 10, and the price is still 80% higher than my alternative option with John. Given that Alice's reductions are not bringing us close enough to my budget, and I have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000, it would be more prudent to take John's offer now rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might not reach my target price.
