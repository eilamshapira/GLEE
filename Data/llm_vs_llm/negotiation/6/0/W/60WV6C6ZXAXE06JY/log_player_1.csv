Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my pricing strategy here. Since the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed fallback option of selling to John for exactly $15,000, there's no risk in offering Bob a higher price.

Without knowing Bob's valuation, I'll set a price that's reasonably higher than my minimum acceptable value, but not so high that it would immediately cause Bob to reject the offer.
