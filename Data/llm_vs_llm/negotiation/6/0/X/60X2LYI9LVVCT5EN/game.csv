Hi Bob! I'm offering this product for $200. Let me know if you're interested.,200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $200 is well above what I'm looking to spend for this product. I have another seller (John) who's offering the same product for $100. Given that, I'd be willing to buy from you for $70, which saves me the hassle of going to another seller. Let me know if that works for you.",70.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your consideration, but $70 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150 for you. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. However, I need to be transparent - I can buy this same product from John for $100, and that's actually the maximum I'm willing to spend on it. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $80. This gives you a sale today without further negotiation, and saves me $20 compared to my alternative option.",80.0,Bob,4,
