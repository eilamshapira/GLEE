Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm offering this product for $200. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $200 is well above what I'm looking to spend for this product. I have another seller (John) who's offering the same product for $100. Given that, I'd be willing to buy from you for $70, which saves me the hassle of going to another seller. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your consideration, but $70 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150 for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. However, I need to be transparent - I can buy this same product from John for $100, and that's actually the maximum I'm willing to spend on it. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $80. This gives you a sale today without further negotiation, and saves me $20 compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
