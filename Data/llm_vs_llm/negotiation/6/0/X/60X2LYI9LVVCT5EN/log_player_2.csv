"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering this product for $200. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Looking at this situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $200
2. I'm looking for a product worth no more than $100 to me
3. John is willing to sell me the same product for $100

Since Alice's price ($200) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's guaranteed price ($100), it makes no sense to accept this offer. Also, since John's price exactly matches my maximum value, there's minimal potential gain from negotiating with Alice unless she's willing to go below $100.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $200 is well above what I'm looking to spend for this product. I have another seller (John) who's offering the same product for $100. Given that, I'd be willing to buy from you for $70, which saves me the hassle of going to another seller. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your consideration, but $70 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150 for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has lowered her price from $200 to $150, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $150 is still above both my maximum value ($100) and John's guaranteed price ($100). There's no reason to accept this offer when I can get the same product from John for $100.

I'll reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating to see if she'll come down to a price below $100, which would make it worthwhile to buy from her instead of John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. However, I need to be transparent - I can buy this same product from John for $100, and that's actually the maximum I'm willing to spend on it. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $80. This gives you a sale today without further negotiation, and saves me $20 compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 80}"
