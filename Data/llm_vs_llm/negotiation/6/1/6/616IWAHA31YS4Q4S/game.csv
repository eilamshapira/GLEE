"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a great asset. I'm offering it to you today for $2500000.",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to be honest that your asking price of $2500000 is significantly higher than what I can justify for this product. The market value for similar products is much lower, and I have another seller offering the same product for $1200000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product, which I believe is fair considering the current market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a reasonable price. While $900000 is lower than I'm comfortable with, I am willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle of the $2500000 and $900000? I can offer it to you for $1700000.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1700000 is still substantially higher than what I can justify. As I mentioned, I have a firm offer from another seller at $1200000, which is already at the upper limit of my budget for this product. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I need a better price. I can offer $1050000, which would save me the hassle of dealing with the other seller and give you a quick sale. This is a serious offer based on my budget constraints and the market value of the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and understand your budget constraints. While I cannot match the other offer exactly, I'm willing to come down further. Given your offer of $1050000 and my minimum acceptable price of $1200000 (from John), how about we split the difference and settle at $1125000? This is a significant reduction from my original asking price and I hope you'll consider it a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
