Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a great asset. I'm offering it to you today for $2,500,000."", ""product_price"": 2500000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to be honest that your asking price of $2500000 is significantly higher than what I can justify for this product. The market value for similar products is much lower, and I have another seller offering the same product for $1200000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product, which I believe is fair considering the current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a reasonable price. While $900,000 is lower than I'm comfortable with, I am willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle of the $2,500,000 and $900,000? I can offer it to you for $1,700,000."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1700000 is still substantially higher than what I can justify. As I mentioned, I have a firm offer from another seller at $1200000, which is already at the upper limit of my budget for this product. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I need a better price. I can offer $1050000, which would save me the hassle of dealing with the other seller and give you a quick sale. This is a serious offer based on my budget constraints and the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and understand your budget constraints. While I cannot match the other offer exactly, I'm willing to come down further. Given your offer of $1,050,000 and my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 (from John), how about we split the difference and settle at $1,125,000? This is a significant reduction from my original asking price and I hope you'll consider it a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1125000}"
