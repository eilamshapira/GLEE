"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a great asset. I'm offering it to you today for $2500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given the information, Alice's offer is $2,500,000, which is significantly higher than the product's worth to me (no more than $1,200,000) and higher than John's guaranteed price of $1,200,000.

There's no reason to accept this offer, and since I know I can always buy from John at $1,200,000, I should try to negotiate with Alice to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to be honest that your asking price of $2,500,000 is significantly higher than what I can justify for this product. The market value for similar products is much lower, and I have another seller offering the same product for $1,200,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product, which I believe is fair considering the current market conditions."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a reasonable price. While $900000 is lower than I'm comfortable with, I am willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle of the $2500000 and $900000? I can offer it to you for $1700000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's offer of $1,700,000 is still higher than John's guaranteed price of $1,200,000, and it exceeds the maximum value of $1,200,000 that the product is worth to me.

Since I can get the same product from John for $1,200,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer. I should reject it and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,700,000 is still substantially higher than what I can justify. As I mentioned, I have a firm offer from another seller at $1,200,000, which is already at the upper limit of my budget for this product. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I need a better price. I can offer $1,050,000, which would save me the hassle of dealing with the other seller and give you a quick sale. This is a serious offer based on my budget constraints and the market value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and understand your budget constraints. While I cannot match the other offer exactly, I'm willing to come down further. Given your offer of $1050000 and my minimum acceptable price of $1200000 (from John), how about we split the difference and settle at $1125000? This is a significant reduction from my original asking price and I hope you'll consider it a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has offered the product for $1,125,000, which is less than John's price of $1,200,000 and also less than the maximum value of $1,200,000 that the product is worth to me.

This is a good deal since I'll save $75,000 compared to buying from John. The offer is within my acceptable range and represents a significant reduction from Alice's original asking price.
