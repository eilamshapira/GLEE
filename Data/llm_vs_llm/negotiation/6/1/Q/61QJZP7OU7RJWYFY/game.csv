"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your product, I believe the price is still quite high compared to its market value. The product is worth considerably less, and I would be willing to pay $1250000 for it. This would still provide you with a healthy profit while giving me a fair price. I look forward to reaching an agreement that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice. That shows good faith in our negotiation. However, I still think we can find a more balanced agreement. Given that my research shows similar products in the market are priced significantly lower, I'm prepared to offer $1300000. This gives you a solid profit margin while still being fair to my budget constraints. I hope we can meet at a price point that satisfies both our interests.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I can see we're making progress toward a mutually beneficial agreement. I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price to $1375000. To meet you part way, I'm prepared to increase my offer to $1325000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and would provide you with a substantial profit while still giving me the value I need. I believe this is a fair compromise that balances both our interests.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
