Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your product, I believe the price is still quite high compared to its market value. The product is worth considerably less, and I would be willing to pay $1250000 for it. This would still provide you with a healthy profit while giving me a fair price. I look forward to reaching an agreement that works for both of us.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering your price, Alice. That shows good faith in our negotiation. However, I still think we can find a more balanced agreement. Given that my research shows similar products in the market are priced significantly lower, I'm prepared to offer $1300000. This gives you a solid profit margin while still being fair to my budget constraints. I hope we can meet at a price point that satisfies both our interests.
