"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Considering its exclusivity and potential, I'm offering it to you for: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $18,000
3. John is offering the same product for $15,000

The logical choice is to buy from John since:
- Alice's price ($18,000) is above my maximum value ($15,000)
- John's price ($15,000) matches my maximum value
- I would save $3,000 by buying from John
