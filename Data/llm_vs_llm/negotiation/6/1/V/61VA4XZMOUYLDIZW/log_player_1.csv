Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your proposal, I believe there's room for us to find a more mutually beneficial price point. The product is certainly valuable to me, but I've done some market research and feel that $850000 would be a fair price that still provides you with a good profit margin above your costs. This would save me significantly compared to other options in the market, while still ensuring you make a worthwhile sale. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to a point where I feel we can reach an agreement. I can offer you $875000 for the product. This represents a significant profit for you while still allowing me to save compared to other options in the market. This seems like a fair middle ground between our positions. What do you think?
