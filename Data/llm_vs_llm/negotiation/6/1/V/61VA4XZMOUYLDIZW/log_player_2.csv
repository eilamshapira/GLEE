"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1 million to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This represents a significant savings for you and allows me to earn a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given the information, I need to evaluate whether to accept Alice's offer, make a counteroffer, or buy from John.

Alice is offering the product for $950,000, which is below the maximum I'm willing to pay ($1,000,000) and represents a $50,000 savings compared to buying from John.

However, since Alice mentioned the product is worth $800,000 to her, there's room for negotiation. I can potentially save more money by making a counteroffer rather than immediately accepting.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your proposal, I believe there's room for us to find a more mutually beneficial price point. The product is certainly valuable to me, but I've done some market research and feel that $850,000 would be a fair price that still provides you with a good profit margin above your costs. This would save me significantly compared to other options in the market, while still ensuring you make a worthwhile sale. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?"", ""product_price"": 850000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850000 is a fair price, I'm still hoping to achieve a price point that reflects the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, which still represents a substantial savings for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

I know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so she would still make a $100,000 profit at this price. There might be room for one more round of negotiation to get an even better price, but there's also the risk that Alice could decide not to lower her price further.

Since $900,000 is already a good price (10% below my maximum willingness to pay), and we're making progress in the negotiation, I'll continue negotiating.

I'm getting closer to a point where I feel we can reach an agreement. I can offer you $875,000 for the product. This represents a significant profit for you while still allowing me to save compared to other options in the market. This seems like a fair middle ground between our positions.
