"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $7500 for it.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $7500 is a bit below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is a significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $9000.  Would you be willing to consider $8500?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase then.",8500.0,Bob,4,
