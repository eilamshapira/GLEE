I'm going to try and negotiate with Alice to get a better price. $10,000 is too high for me right now."

Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $7500 is a bit below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is a significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

I'm still not comfortable with $9,000.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before I consider buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $9000.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase then."", ""product_price"": 8500}
