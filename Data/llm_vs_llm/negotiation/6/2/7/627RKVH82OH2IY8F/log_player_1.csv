Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I'm curious to see how much Bob values the product and how willing he is to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for that amount. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm lowering my price from $1,500,000 to $1,000,000. This is still above my minimum price of $1,200,000, but it's a significant concession to show that I'm serious about making a deal with Bob. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to him while still securing a good price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is still unwilling to meet me halfway. While I would prefer to get a higher price, I'm not willing to go any lower.  It's better to sell to John and ensure a guaranteed profit than risk further negotiations with Bob that might end up fruitless."
