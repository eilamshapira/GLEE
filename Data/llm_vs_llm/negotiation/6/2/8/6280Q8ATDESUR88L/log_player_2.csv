"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice is offering the product for $1,400,000, which is $100,000 less than John's price of $1,500,000. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible while acquiring the product, I should try to negotiate with Alice for an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still reasonable given that the product is worth $800,000 to her.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has lowered her offer to $1,300,000, which is $200,000 less than John's price. This shows she's willing to negotiate. However, there's still a significant gap between her offer and what would be a fair price considering the product is worth $800,000 to her. I should continue negotiating to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $1,400,000 to $1,300,000, she's showing willingness to negotiate. I'll increase my previous offer to show I'm also negotiating in good faith, but still aim for a price that gives me good value.
