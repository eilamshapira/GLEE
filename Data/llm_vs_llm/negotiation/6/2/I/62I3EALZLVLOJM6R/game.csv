"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $1500000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me, which is what another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $650000 for the product. This would save me some money compared to my alternative option, while still providing you with a substantial sale.",650000.0,Bob,2,
