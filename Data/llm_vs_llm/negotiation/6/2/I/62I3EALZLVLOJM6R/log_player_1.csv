Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you our exclusive product at $1,500,000. This product is built to the highest standards and represents exceptional value. I believe this price reflects its unique quality. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $1500000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me, which is what another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $650000 for the product. This would save me some money compared to my alternative option, while still providing you with a substantial sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
