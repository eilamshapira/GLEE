"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our exclusive product at $1500000. This product is built to the highest standards and represents exceptional value. I believe this price reflects its unique quality. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she's asking for $1,500,000, which is the full value of the product to her. However, this product is only worth up to $800,000 to me, so accepting this offer would be a bad deal.

I have the option to buy from John for $800,000 right away, but before doing that, I should try negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a better price.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, which is what another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product. This would save me some money compared to my alternative option, while still providing you with a substantial sale."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
