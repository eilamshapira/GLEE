"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $25000. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with the purchase!",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $25000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I can buy this product from other sellers for significantly less. However, I'd be interested in buying from you if we can reach a fair price. I'm prepared to offer $10000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. However, the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to lower my offer to $20000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility, but $20000 is still more than I can justify spending. John has offered me the same product for $15000, and that's already at the upper limit of what this product is worth to me. To continue doing business with you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer $12000, which would save me from having to go with another seller. Let me know if we can make this work.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your situation and the offer from John. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $17000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and should be a good deal considering the value of the product. Let me know if you can meet me at this price.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price, Alice. Your offer of $17000 is getting closer, but I still have John's offer of $15000, which is the absolute maximum I can spend on this product based on its value to me. If you can match John's price of $15000, I'd be happy to do business with you instead. Otherwise, I'll need to go with his offer. What do you say to $15000?",15000.0,Bob,6,
