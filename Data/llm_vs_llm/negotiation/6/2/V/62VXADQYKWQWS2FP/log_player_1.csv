Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $25000 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I can buy this product from other sellers for significantly less. However, I'd be interested in buying from you if we can reach a fair price. I'm prepared to offer $10000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility, but $20000 is still more than I can justify spending. John has offered me the same product for $15000, and that's already at the upper limit of what this product is worth to me. To continue doing business with you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer $12000, which would save me from having to go with another seller. Let me know if we can make this work.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price, Alice. Your offer of $17000 is getting closer, but I still have John's offer of $15000, which is the absolute maximum I can spend on this product based on its value to me. If you can match John's price of $15000, I'd be happy to do business with you instead. Otherwise, I'll need to go with his offer. What do you say to $15000?
