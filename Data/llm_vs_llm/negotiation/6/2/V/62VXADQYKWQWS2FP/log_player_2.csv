"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $25000. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with the purchase! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully:

1. Alice is offering the product for $25,000
2. The product is worth at most $15,000 to me
3. I have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $15,000

Alice's price is $10,000 higher than the product's maximum value to me, and also $10,000 higher than John's price. There's no reason to accept this offer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. However, the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to lower my offer to $20000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer:

1. Alice has lowered her price to $20,000
2. The product is worth at most $15,000 to me
3. I can still buy from John for $15,000

While Alice has reduced her price by $5,000, it's still $5,000 higher than both the product's maximum value to me and John's price. There's no reason to accept this offer when I have a better alternative.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility, but $20,000 is still more than I can justify spending. John has offered me the same product for $15,000, and that's already at the upper limit of what this product is worth to me. To continue doing business with you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer $12,000, which would save me from having to go with another seller. Let me know if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your situation and the offer from John. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $17000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and should be a good deal considering the value of the product. Let me know if you can meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Evaluating Alice's latest offer:

1. Alice has now lowered her price to $17,000
2. The product is worth at most $15,000 to me
3. I can buy from John for $15,000

Alice has continued to lower her price, but it's still $2,000 more than both John's price and the maximum value to me. Since I can get the same product from John at a better price that matches my valuation limit, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer.
