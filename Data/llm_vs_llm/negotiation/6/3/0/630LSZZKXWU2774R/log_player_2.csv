"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","$300 is much higher than the maximum value of $150 that the product is worth to me. It's also higher than John's guaranteed offer of $150. I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know I can get the product from John for $150, I'll start with a lower counteroffer to Alice to see if I can get a better deal.
