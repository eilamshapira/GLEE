Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I was thinking of a lower price point. How about $600000? This would align better with my budget and the value I see in the product. Would you consider this counteroffer?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

I understand budget considerations, but I need to be clear that the product is worth no less than $1,000,000 to me. In fact, I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase it at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer you the product for $950,000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer.

However, I must be transparent - the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I have John ready to purchase at that price. Given that the product is worth $800,000 to you (based on my market research), I'm willing to offer it at $900,000 as my final price. This represents a $100,000 discount from what I could get elsewhere, but I'm extending this offer because I'd prefer to do business with you. If we can't reach an agreement at this price point, I'll need to proceed with my alternative buyer."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
