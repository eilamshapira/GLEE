Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand budget considerations, but I need to be clear that the product is worth no less than $1000000 to me. In fact, I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase it at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can offer you the product for $950000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This is quite competitive considering the product's value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your increased offer. However, I must be transparent - the product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I have John ready to purchase at that price. Given that the product is worth $800000 to you (based on my market research), I'm willing to offer it at $900000 as my final price. This represents a $100000 discount from what I could get elsewhere, but I'm extending this offer because I'd prefer to do business with you. If we can't reach an agreement at this price point, I'll need to proceed with my alternative buyer.
