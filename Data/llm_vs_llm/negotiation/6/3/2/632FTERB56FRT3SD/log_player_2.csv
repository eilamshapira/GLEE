"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice is offering the product for $100, which is the same price as John is offering, and you're looking to save as much money as possible while still getting the product, there's no price advantage to either option.

Given that there's no difference in price, and the product is worth no more than $100 to you, I'll accept Alice's offer since she's the primary seller you're interacting with.
