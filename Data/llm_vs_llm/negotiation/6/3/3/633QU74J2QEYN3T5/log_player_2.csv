Alice's offer is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I should try to negotiate a lower price."

I'll start by offering what the product is worth to Alice.  It's a long shot she'll accept, but it gives me the most room to negotiate upwards."

While $140 is better, I think there's still room to negotiate before going to John."

Let's try a counteroffer that splits the difference between her last offer ($140) and mine ($100)."

Alice is coming down in smaller increments now, and $130 is a reasonable price.  I'll accept before she potentially increases her price again."
