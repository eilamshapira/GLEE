,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100 for the product.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. However, $100 is too low for me. The product has significant value. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $220.",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product has significant value, but $220 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $110 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",110.0,Bob,4,
