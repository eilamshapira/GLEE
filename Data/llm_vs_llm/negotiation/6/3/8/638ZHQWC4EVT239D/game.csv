"Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll find our asking price of $1450000 quite reasonable.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $1450000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850000, which is the maximum I can afford right now.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $850000 is significantly lower than our target price. To show good faith, we're willing to come down to $1300000. I hope we can find some middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1075000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $1075000 is still lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to lower my price to $1200000 to show that I'm serious about making this deal happen.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $1150000, but that's my final offer. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
