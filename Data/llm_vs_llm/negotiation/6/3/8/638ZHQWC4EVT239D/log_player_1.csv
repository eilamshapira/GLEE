Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $1450000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850000, which is the maximum I can afford right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

I will wait for Bob's response before making my next decision. I am willing to negotiate further, but I will keep John's offer in mind and may choose to sell to him if Bob's counteroffers are not satisfactory. I will consider Bob's budget constraints, but I will also prioritize maximizing my profit."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1075000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

I will wait for Bob's response before making my next decision. I am still willing to negotiate, but I am also considering John's offer. I will need to see if Bob can come closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $1150000, but that's my final offer. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but after careful consideration, I've decided to accept another offer from a different buyer. I regret that we couldn't reach an agreement, and I hope we can do business together in the future.""}

I have decided to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, as it is the best price I can get for the product. I have tried to negotiate with Bob, but his final offer is still significantly lower than John's offer. Therefore, I have decided to accept John's offer and close the deal."
