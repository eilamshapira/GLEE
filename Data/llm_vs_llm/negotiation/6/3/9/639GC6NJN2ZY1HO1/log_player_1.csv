"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer, considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob and I know I can get $800,000 from John as a backup.

{""product_price"": 1,100,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is quite reasonable, as it's substantially higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and gives me a good profit. While I could try to negotiate for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that prolonged negotiation might lead to a less favorable outcome or Bob walking away. Since this is a solid offer that's $200,000 above my fallback option with John, I'll accept it.
