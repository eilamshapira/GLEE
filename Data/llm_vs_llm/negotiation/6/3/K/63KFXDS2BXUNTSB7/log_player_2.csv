"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The rational choice is to buy from John for $8,000 because:
1. Alice's offer ($18,000) is significantly higher than my maximum value for the product ($8,000)
2. John's offer ($8,000) matches my maximum value
3. Buying from Alice would mean a loss in value, while buying from John gives me the product at my maximum acceptable price"
