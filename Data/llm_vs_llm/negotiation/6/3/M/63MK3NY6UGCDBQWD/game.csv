"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $300 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $50.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. $50 is far too low, but I am willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle, at $250?",250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $250 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $75, which is a bit higher than my previous offer. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price possible. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $225? That's a significant drop from my initial offer.",225.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate the continued negotiation. $225 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering I can buy the product from John for $100, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. This is a significant increase from my previous offers, and I hope it's more in line with what you're looking for.",90.0,Bob,6,
