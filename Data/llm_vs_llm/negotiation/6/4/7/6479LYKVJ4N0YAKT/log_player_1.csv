Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Considering my options:

I want to maximize my profit, and I know the product is worth at least $80 to me. Bob's offer of $90 is better than selling to John for $80.

Therefore, my decision is:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
