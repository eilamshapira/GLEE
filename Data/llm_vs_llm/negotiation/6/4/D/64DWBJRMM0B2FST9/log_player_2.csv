"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you at a special price of $150. This is a great deal as the value of the product is much higher. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Reason: The offer from Alice is $150, which is above my budget of $100. I can buy the same product from John for $100, so I will reject Alice's offer and consider buying from John instead."
