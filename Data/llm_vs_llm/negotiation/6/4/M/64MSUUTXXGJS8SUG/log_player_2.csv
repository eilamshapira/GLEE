"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given the situation, Alice's offer of $120 is higher than both the product's worth to you ($80) and the alternative option of buying from John for $80. Since the product is only worth $80 to you, paying $120 would result in a loss of $40.
