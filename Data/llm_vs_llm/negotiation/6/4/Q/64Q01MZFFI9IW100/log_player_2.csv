"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique qualities and market demand, I can offer it to you for $10000. Let me know if you’d like to move forward with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to analyze this situation carefully:

1. The product is worth up to $10,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $10,000
3. John's alternative offer is also $10,000

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($10,000), there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other. However, rejecting Alice's offer doesn't make sense because my only alternative is to pay the same price to John.

Given that the prices are identical, I might as well accept Alice's offer since I've already been in communication with her.
