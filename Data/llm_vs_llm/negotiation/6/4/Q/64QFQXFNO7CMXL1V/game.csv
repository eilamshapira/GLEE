"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to purchase a product that holds significant value. While I can't disclose specifics about the product, I can assure you it's worth at least $800000 to me.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000.  This represents a substantial potential gain for you, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's true value.  Please consider this offer carefully. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I believe you have the potential to capitalize on this opportunity in a way that others may not. ",1000000.0,Alice,1,
