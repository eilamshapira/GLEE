"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer and decide if it's in my best interest.

Given that:
- Alice is offering the product for $20,000
- The product is worth at most $15,000 to me
- I can buy the same product from John for $15,000 at any time

Alice's offer of $20,000 exceeds both the maximum value to me and John's guaranteed price. There's no reason to accept this offer when I can get the same product for $5,000 less from John.

I could reject and make a counteroffer, but given the significant gap between Alice's initial offer and my maximum value, I think it's more efficient to go with the sure option.
