"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While your price of $1100000 is better than my alternative option with John, I believe we can find a more balanced price point. I know the product costs you $800000, which would give you a $300000 profit at your offered price. I'd like to propose $900000, which still gives you a significant $100000 profit while allowing me to save more. This creates a more equitable split of the value between us. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your proposal, I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we settle at $1000000? This price still offers you significant value while ensuring a fair profit for me.",1000000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
