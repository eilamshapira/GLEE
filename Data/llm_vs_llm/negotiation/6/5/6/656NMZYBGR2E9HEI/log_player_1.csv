"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While your price of $1100000 is better than my alternative option with John, I believe we can find a more balanced price point. I know the product costs you $800000, which would give you a $300000 profit at your offered price. I'd like to propose $900000, which still gives you a significant $100000 profit while allowing me to save more. This creates a more equitable split of the value between us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
