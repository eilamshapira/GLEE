"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1100000. This is a great opportunity considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $1,100,000:

1) The product is worth up to $1,200,000 to me
2) Alice's cost is $800,000
3) John is willing to sell it for $1,200,000

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is better than John's price by $100,000, but I can probably negotiate a better deal with Alice since there's a $300,000 gap between her cost and her current offer.

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can find a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While your price of $1,100,000 is better than my alternative option with John, I believe we can find a more balanced price point. I know the product costs you $800,000, which would give you a $300,000 profit at your offered price. I'd like to propose $900,000, which still gives you a significant $100,000 profit while allowing me to save more. This creates a more equitable split of the value between us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your proposal, I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we settle at $1000000? This price still offers you significant value while ensuring a fair profit for me.

Let's evaluate the current situation:
- The product is worth up to $1,200,000 to me
- Alice's cost is $800,000
- John will sell it for $1,200,000
- Alice is now offering $1,000,000

Alice's new offer saves me $200,000 compared to buying from John, and gives her a $200,000 profit (which is fair). She met me halfway between her initial offer and my counteroffer, showing good faith in the negotiation.

This seems like a reasonable deal that benefits both parties. I'll accept this offer.
