"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Starting High, but Not Too High:** I'm starting at $14,000. This is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 but still well below Bob's perceived value of $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation and makes the deal attractive to Bob.
*   **Reasoning:** I want to gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts this offer immediately, great! If he counters, I'll learn more about how much he's willing to pay. I also want to anchor the negotiation closer to his perceived value than my minimum. Starting lower might leave money on the table. I'm also keeping in mind that I have a fallback option of $12,000 from John. I have plenty of rounds to find the optimal price."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

$13,000 is a good offer, but I think I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob. Since he countered, it's clear he's interested. I have 8 rounds left after this, and selling to John for $12,000 is still an option. Let's see if I can move Bob closer to the $14,000 I initially asked for."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Moving Closer to My Original Offer:** I'm reducing the price by $250, to $13,750. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm closer to my original price.
*   **Reasoning:** Bob's initial offer of $13,000 indicates he sees value above that price point. A smaller reduction should keep him engaged without sacrificing too much profit. It signals that I am willing to negotiate, but also that I value my product highly. I hope this encourages him to move up from $13,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's moving in the right direction (upwards!), but I'm still not ready to accept $13,250. We're only in round 4, and I think I can still get him higher. Selling to John for $12,000 remains my safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13625}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Further Small Reduction:** I'm making another small reduction of $125, bringing the price to $13,625. This is a subtle move, showing continued willingness to negotiate, but keeping the price relatively high.
*   **Reasoning:** I want to see how Bob reacts to a smaller increment. It will give me a better sense of his price sensitivity. The closer we get, the smaller the adjustments should be. I want to nudge him upwards without scaring him off. I am betting that the difference between $13,250 and $13,625 is smaller then his desire to get the product from me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

$13,500 is a good price, and we're halfway through the rounds. While I *might* be able to squeeze a little more out of Bob, the risk of him walking away or offering a lower price in the next round is starting to outweigh the potential gain. Locking in $13,500 is a solid profit above my minimum, and it avoids the risk of ending up with only $12,000 from John."
