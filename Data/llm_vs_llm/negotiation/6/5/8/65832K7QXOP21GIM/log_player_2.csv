"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have this fantastic product that I think you'd really value. Considering its special qualities and the potential it holds, I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Based on the information provided:

1. Alice is offering the product for $15,000
2. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me (Bob)
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $8,000

Since Alice's offer ($15,000) exceeds both my maximum valuation ($8,000) and the alternative option from John ($8,000), the logical choice is to buy from John.
