(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.
