"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $12500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth.",12500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe the product is valuable, but the price of $12500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000, considering the product's quality and market value.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9000 is too low considering the product's value. I can come down from my initial price, but I need to ensure a fair deal for both of us. I'm willing to offer the product for $11000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the discount, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your revised offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiation so far.",10000.0,Bob,4,
