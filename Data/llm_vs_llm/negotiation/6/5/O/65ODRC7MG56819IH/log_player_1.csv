Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe the product is valuable, but the price of $12500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000, considering the product's quality and market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. $9,000 is too close to my minimum value of $8,000, and since I know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, there's room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is too low considering the product's value. I can come down from my initial price, but I need to ensure a fair deal for both of us. I'm willing to offer the product for $11,000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the discount, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your revised offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiation so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $10,000. This is a reasonable compromise that gives me a good profit margin above my minimum value of $8,000, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
