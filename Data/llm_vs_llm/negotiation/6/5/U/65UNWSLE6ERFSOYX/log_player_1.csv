Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll formulate an offer to Bob.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I need to choose a price that balances the risk of rejection with maximizing my profit. If Bob rejects my offer, I have a guaranteed fallback of $12,000 from selling to John.

I'll set the price higher than my minimum acceptable value to capture additional profit, but not so high that Bob is likely to immediately reject it.
