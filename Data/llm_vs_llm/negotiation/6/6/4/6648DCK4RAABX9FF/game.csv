"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $18000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations if you're interested.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $18000 is way above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8000 is below the product's value. Considering your interest, I'm willing to make a concession. I can offer the product to you for $16000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to come down, $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10000?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this is a fair price considering my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $10000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I can offer the product to you for $14000, which is a significant concession from my original price. If you're still interested, let's discuss further.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is still higher than what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $12000. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with another seller. ",12000.0,Bob,6,
