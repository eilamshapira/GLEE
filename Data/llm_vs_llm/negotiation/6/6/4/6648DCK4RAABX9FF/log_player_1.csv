Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $18,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18000 is way above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8000 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me, and I have a better alternative offer from John for $12,000, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price. 

My counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8,000 is below the product's value. Considering your interest, I'm willing to make a concession. I can offer the product to you for $16,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to come down, $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10000?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this is a fair price considering my budget.

Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is still lower than the alternative offer I have from John for $12,000, I will reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer to try to get a better price or at least match John's offer.

My counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for.

Bob's offer:

Since Bob's offer of $12,000 matches the alternative offer I have from John, I will accept Bob's offer. This way, I can sell the product to Bob, who has shown a genuine interest in it, and still get the same price I would have gotten from John."
