Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is of exceptional value, and I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking for a better price. I would like to offer $1100000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll send Bob a counteroffer. His offer of $1,100,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and I know I can get at least $1,200,000 from John. However, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, your offer of $1,100,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. Given the product's value, I can revise my offer to $1,350,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This is still a fair price for the quality and value you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
