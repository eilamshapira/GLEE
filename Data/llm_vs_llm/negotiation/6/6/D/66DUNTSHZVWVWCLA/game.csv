"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2000000 is significantly above market value for this product. I can actually get the same product from another seller for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $1300000 for the product, which would still give you a reasonable profit.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
"I understand your perspective, Bob, but I can't sell this product for $1300000, as its value is significantly more than that to me. I'm willing to come down to $1800000. This is a fair offer, given the unique properties of this product.  I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1800000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I have a firm offer from another seller for $1500000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer you $1400000, which is still a fair price and gives you a reasonable profit.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I understand your position, but this product is worth significantly more to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current offers at $1600000. This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
