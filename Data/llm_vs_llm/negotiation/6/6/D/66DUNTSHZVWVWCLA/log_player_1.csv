Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2000000 is significantly above market value for this product. I can actually get the same product from another seller for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $1300000 for the product, which would still give you a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Bob's offer:

However, I need to be transparent - I have a firm offer from another seller for $1500000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product.
