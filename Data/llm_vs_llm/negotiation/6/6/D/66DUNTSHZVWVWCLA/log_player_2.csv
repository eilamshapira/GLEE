"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product.  I know its value to you is considerable, and I'm willing to part with it for $2000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price Alice is offering ($2,000,000) is significantly higher than both:
1. The maximum value the product is worth to me ($1,500,000)
2. John's alternative offer ($1,500,000)

It would be reasonable to reject this offer and make a counteroffer closer to the actual value of the product. If negotiations with Alice don't lead to a better price, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,000,000 is significantly above market value for this product. I can actually get the same product from another seller for $1,500,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product, which would still give you a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob, but I can't sell this product for $1300000. I'm willing to come down to $1800000. This is a fair offer, considering the product's unique properties, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,800,000 is still above both:
1. The maximum value the product is worth to me ($1,500,000)
2. John's alternative offer ($1,500,000)

While Alice has reduced the price, it's still not competitive with John's offer. I'll reject and make another counteroffer. If Alice doesn't come down to a more reasonable price, I can still purchase from John at $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, I need to be transparent - I have a firm offer from another seller for $1,500,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer you $1,400,000, which is still a fair price and gives you a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but this product is worth significantly more to me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current offers at $1600000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's final offer of $1,600,000 is still above:
1. The maximum value the product is worth to me ($1,500,000)
2. John's alternative offer ($1,500,000)

And Alice has indicated this is her final offer, it makes the most financial sense to accept John's offer at $1,500,000. This saves me $100,000 compared to Alice's final offer and matches the maximum value I'm willing to pay for the product."
