"Hi Bob, I understand your initial offer is lower than my asking price. However, $6000 is far below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle a bit? I can come down to $23000.",23000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're moving in the right direction! $9000 is still a significant difference from my minimum acceptable price, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'll lower my offer to $21000. That's a substantial drop from my initial asking price.",21000.0,Alice,5,
