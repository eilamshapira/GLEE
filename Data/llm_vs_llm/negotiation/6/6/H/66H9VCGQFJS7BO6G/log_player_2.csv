"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and Alice's offer is $150, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. Additionally, since I have the option to buy the product from John for $80, which is within my budget, I don't need to consider accepting Alice's offer or buying from John immediately. I will first reject Alice's offer to see if she can provide a better price.
