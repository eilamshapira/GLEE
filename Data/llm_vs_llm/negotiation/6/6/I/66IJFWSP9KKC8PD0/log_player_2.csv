"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $12000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, it's still significantly higher than Alice's valuation of $8,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price and might entice Alice to come down closer to her valuation."
