"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity. I believe this product will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm starting the negotiation at a price of $2500000.",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but it would need to be significantly lower for me to consider it. I'm willing to offer $500000.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500000 is far too low. As I mentioned, this product has significant value. I'm willing to come down from my initial price, but I can't go that low. My counteroffer is $2200000.",2200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but we're still very far apart on price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650000, but that's a firm step towards a reasonable compromise.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate you increasing your offer, $650000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I am willing to negotiate further. Let's try to meet closer to the middle. My counteroffer is $1900000.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're making some progress, but your price is still quite high. To be frank, exceeding my budget significantly limits my flexibility. I can offer $800000 as my final offer. This is my limit, and I believe it's a fair price considering John is also offering the product at this price.",800000.0,Bob,6,
