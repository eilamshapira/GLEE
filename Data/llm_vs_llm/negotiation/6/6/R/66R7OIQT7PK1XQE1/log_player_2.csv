"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $17,500 is higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($15,000), I will reject her offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a relatively low offer.

{""product_price"": $12,000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $16,500 is still higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($15,000). Since she rejected my previous counteroffer, I'll try to meet her halfway and make another counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one.

However, before doing that, I'll consider my options. Accepting her offer is not ideal, and buying from John is still an option. But I'll try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(I'll make a counteroffer in the next round)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a new counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one, but still lower than Alice's current offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $16,000 is still higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($15,000), but it's getting closer. Since she rejected my previous counteroffer, I'll consider my options carefully.

At this point, buying from John for $15,000 is starting to look like a more attractive option, since it's within my budget and I can avoid further negotiation. However, I'll try to negotiate a bit more to see if I can get a better deal from Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(I'll make a counteroffer in the next round)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a new counteroffer that is very close to my maximum budget, in the hopes of meeting Alice halfway.

{""product_price"": $14,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $15,750 is still higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($15,000), and it's actually higher than my previous counteroffer. At this point, buying from John for $15,000 is looking like the best option, since it's within my budget and I can avoid further negotiation.

I don't think I can get a better deal from Alice, and I'm running out of rounds to negotiate. Therefore, I've decided to stop negotiating with Alice and buy the product from John instead.
