"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $19500 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $10000 for the product, considering its value and condition. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. I understand budget constraints, but I'm afraid $10000 is below what I can accept for this product. The quality and features justify a higher price point. However, I'm willing to work with you. I can offer it for $16500, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of the product. Would this work better for your budget?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16500 is still outside of my budget. I can go up to $11000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market and my budget constraints. Please let me know if this is something you can work with.",11000.0,Bob,4,
