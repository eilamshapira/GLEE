Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. I understand budget constraints, but I'm afraid $10000 is below what I can accept for this product. The quality and features justify a higher price point. However, I'm willing to work with you. I can offer it for $16500, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of the product. Would this work better for your budget?
