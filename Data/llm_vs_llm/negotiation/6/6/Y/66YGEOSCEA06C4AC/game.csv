"Hi Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. This product is of excellent quality and has been valued highly in the market. I'm offering it to you for $18000. This is a competitive price given the product's quality and market value.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is far above my budget. While I understand you're offering a quality product, similar products are available in the market for much less. I'd be willing to offer $8500 for the product. This is a fair price considering current market conditions.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8500 is too low for this product. My bottom line is $12000, which is the minimum value of the product to me. I've actually received an offer from another buyer at this price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $15000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value for the quality you're receiving.",15000.0,Alice,3,
