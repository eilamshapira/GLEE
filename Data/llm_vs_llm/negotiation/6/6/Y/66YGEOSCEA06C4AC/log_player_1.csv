Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you. This product is of excellent quality and has been valued highly in the market.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is far above my budget. While I understand you're offering a quality product, similar products are available in the market for much less. I'd be willing to offer $8500 for the product. This is a fair price considering current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,500 is too low for this product. My bottom line is $12,000, which is the minimum value of the product to me. I've actually received an offer from another buyer at this price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $15,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents good value for the quality you're receiving."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
