,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10000 for this product. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10000 is below our minimum threshold for this product. I can go as low as $16000, considering it's you. Let me know if this works for you.",16000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $16000 might still be a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $15500? This is the best I can do while still valuing our potential business relationship. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $15500 is still outside my budget. Could you consider $11500? I'm serious about purchasing this product, and I believe this would be a fair deal for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this, and I appreciate that. However, $11500 is still below what we can accept. I'm willing to go down to $15000, which is our absolute minimum. This is a one-time offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other buyers. Let me know if you can meet us at this price.",15000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. Given the value of the product and our costs, I can't go any lower than $15000. This is our final offer. If this works for you, we can close the deal today. If not, I'll need to consider other options. Please let me know your decision.",15000.0,Alice,5,
