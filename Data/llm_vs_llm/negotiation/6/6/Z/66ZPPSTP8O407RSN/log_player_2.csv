"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $18000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-value item at a competitive rate. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer. It's highly unlikely Alice would agree to a price close to your desired range in one round.  Therefore, it's best to reject and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000 for this product. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $10,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, it establishes a starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This counteroffer allows room to gradually increase the bid towards your actual budget ceiling ($12,000).
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful of Alice's time while clearly stating your price expectations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $16000 might still be a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $15500? This is the best I can do while still valuing our potential business relationship. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice came down slightly, but her offer is still significantly above your $12,000 limit. We should continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $15,500 is still outside my budget. Could you consider $11,500? I'm serious about purchasing this product, and I believe this would be a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're increasing our offer from $10,000 to $11,500, showing Alice that we're willing to negotiate and move towards a compromise. 
* **Staying Below Limit:** This counteroffer keeps us comfortably below our $12,000 limit, leaving room for a potential final push if needed.
* **Expressing Seriousness:** Reassures Alice of our intention to buy while emphasizing our desire for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. Given the value of the product and our costs, I can't go any lower than $15000. This is our final offer. If this works for you, we can close the deal today. If not, I'll need to consider other options. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

It seems we've reached an impasse with Alice. She's holding firm at $15,000, which is above your $12,000 limit.  While you could continue negotiating, it's unlikely she'll come down significantly from her ""final offer.""  At this point, it's the most sensible decision to buy from John for $12,000. This ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids further potentially fruitless negotiation with Alice."
