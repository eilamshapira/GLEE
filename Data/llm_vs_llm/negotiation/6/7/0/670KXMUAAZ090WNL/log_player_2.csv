"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $120 is higher than both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Even if negotiations fail, I can always buy from John at $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}

I'll offer $80, which is significantly below John's price of $100. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to buying from John. If Alice's cost is well below $100, she might still make a profit at this price, and I would save $20 compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $110 is still above John's price of $100, so there's no reason to accept it. I'll reject and make another counteroffer. Since we still have several rounds left and Alice has shown some flexibility by reducing her price from $120 to $110, there's potential to negotiate a better deal than John's $100 price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 85}

I'll increase my previous offer slightly to $85, showing some movement towards a compromise while still maintaining a good margin below John's price of $100. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate upward, but I'm still aiming to get a better deal than John's offer. If Alice rejects this, I still have several rounds to negotiate or ultimately go with John's option."
