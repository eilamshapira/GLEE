"Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's offer of $119 is very close to the maximum I'm willing to pay ($120) and only $1 less than John's price. Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, I believe there's room to negotiate for a better price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has lowered her price from $119 to $110, which is a good improvement. However, knowing the product is worth $80 to her, there's still room for negotiation to find a better middle ground between our positions.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has now lowered her price to $105, which is $15 less than John's price. We're making good progress in the negotiation, as Alice has come down from $119 to $105. The gap between our positions is narrowing (I offered $95, she's now at $105). While I could try one more round of negotiation, I think $105 is a reasonable price that gives both of us some value in the transaction.
