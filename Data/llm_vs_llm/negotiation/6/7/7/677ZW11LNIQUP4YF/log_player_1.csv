"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe $3000000 is above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, considering the product's worth to me. I'd like to propose a price of $1200000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer because it's below the minimum value I have for the product, and I believe I can get a better deal. Since selling to John for $1,500,000 is still an option that is higher than Bob's offer, I'll proceed to make a counteroffer to Bob in the hopes of reaching a mutually beneficial price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $3000000 might be above your budget, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. Considering your interest, I'm willing to negotiate.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2500000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer, but I need to stay within a reasonable range. I'd like to propose a price of $1400000, which I believe is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $1,400,000 because, although it's an increase from his previous offer, it's still below the minimum value I'm willing to accept, and it's also less than what John is offering. Since I have a better option with John at $1,500,000, I'll continue to negotiate with Bob to see if he can meet or exceed this price. My next step will be to make another counteroffer to Bob."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the significant reduction in your offer. However, $2200000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. Considering we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price, I'd like to propose a price of $1450000.

I reject Bob's offer of $1,450,000. Although Bob has increased his offer again, it's still below the offer from John, which is $1,500,000. Since I have a better option with John and Bob's offer, although closer, does not meet or exceed this price, I will continue to negotiate with Bob to see if he can meet or exceed John's offer.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

I accept Bob's offer of $1,500,000. Since Bob has finally met the price that I considered as the minimum acceptable value for the product, and it matches the offer from John, I see no need to continue negotiating or risking the deal by trying to get a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures I get a fair deal for the product, and it concludes the negotiation on a positive note for both parties."
