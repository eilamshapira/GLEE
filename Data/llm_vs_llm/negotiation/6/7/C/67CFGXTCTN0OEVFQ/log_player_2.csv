"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Looking at the situation:

- Alice is offering the product for $11,000
- John is willing to sell the same product for $10,000
- The product is worth no more than $10,000 to you

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, the best choice is to buy from John for $10,000. This gives me the lowest price and stays within the product's value to me.
