"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob and I want to earn as much money as I can, I'll start by offering a high price. 

{""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $950,000 is higher than my minimum price of $800,000 and we have 8 more rounds to negotiate, I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $950,000, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my initial offer of $1,150,000. 

{""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is very close to my initial offer and is a good price, I'll consider accepting it. However, I'll also think about the fact that the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so there might be some room for further negotiation. But given that we're already at round 4 and I don't want to risk losing the deal, I'll accept Bob's offer.
