"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll analyze the situation:

- Alice is offering to sell the product for $1,150,000
- The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me
- I can always buy from John for $1,200,000
- Alice's cost is $800,000, so she has room to negotiate
- We have 10 rounds available for negotiation

Since Alice's current offer ($1,150,000) is already better than John's price ($1,200,000), and we have plenty of negotiation rounds left, it makes sense to reject this first offer and make a counteroffer to try to save more money.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives Alice a good profit while also allowing me to save money compared to her initial offer and John's price.

{""product_price"": $950,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll analyze the updated situation:

- Alice has reduced her price from $1,150,000 to $1,100,000
- This shows she's willing to negotiate down
- We still have 7 more potential rounds of negotiation
- Her cost is $800,000, so she has further room to reduce the price
- This offer is already $100,000 better than John's price

Since Alice is showing flexibility and we have more rounds available, I'll reject this offer to try to get an even better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer to move closer to Alice's position while still trying to save money.
