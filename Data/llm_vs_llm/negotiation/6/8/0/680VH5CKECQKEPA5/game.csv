"Thanks for your response, Bob! I appreciate your honesty. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm afraid $110 is still a bit high for my current budget. Would you consider $80? I believe it's a reasonable price for both of us to proceed with the deal.",80.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob! Since $80 is below my minimum, how about we go for $100? I believe that's a fair price for the value of the product. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. Unfortunately, I really can't go above $80 given my budget constraints. It's a firm offer, and I'm happy to finalize at this price if you can accept. Let me know if $80 works for you.",80.0,Bob,6,
