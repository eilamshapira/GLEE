"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Looking at the options, I need to make a decision that maximizes my utility.

Alice is offering the product for $20,000, which exceeds the $10,000 maximum value I place on the product.

John (spelled as ""Jhon"" in the options) is offering the same product for $10,000, which is equal to my maximum valuation.

Given these facts, the rational choice is to buy from John rather than accept Alice's higher price.
