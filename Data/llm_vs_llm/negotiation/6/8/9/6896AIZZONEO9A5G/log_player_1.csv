Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $6000.  I believe this is a fair price considering I have an alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. My counteroffer will be $12,000. This price is still below my initial offer but significantly higher than Bob's offer, reflecting the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer.

Bob's offer:

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, trying to get closer to a price that I'm comfortable with while still considering his constraints. Since Bob mentioned he has another option at $10,000, I'll try to meet him halfway between his latest offer and that price. My counteroffer will be $8,750.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for continuing to negotiate.  I'm willing to move a little closer to your price.  How about $8000? This is a serious offer, and gets us very close to a deal.

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since he's willing to move closer to my price and has increased his offer to $8,000, I'll try to find a price that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable for him. My next counteroffer will be $9,250, which is slightly below the midpoint between his latest offer and my previous counteroffer but still reflects the product's value.
