"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $1,500,000 against my alternatives.

Given that:
- The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
- John is willing to sell me the product for $800,000
- Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000

Alice's offer ($1,500,000) is significantly higher than both the product's value to me and John's offer. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer when I can buy the same product from John for a much better price that matches the product's maximum value to me.
