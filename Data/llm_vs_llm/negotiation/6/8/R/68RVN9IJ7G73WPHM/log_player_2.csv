"Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","If I buy the product from Alice for $125, I would be paying $25 more than its worth to me ($100). Additionally, this price is even higher than the guaranteed option from John, who is offering it for $100.

Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum valuation ($100), and Alice's initial offer is above my valuation, the best decision is to buy from John.
