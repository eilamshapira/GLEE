"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to consider my options carefully.

Alice is offering me the product for $1,350,000. If I buy from John, it would cost me $1,500,000, which is $150,000 more than Alice's price. Since the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, and Alice's offer is lower than this maximum value, it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer.

If I reject Alice's offer without buying from John, I would have no product at all, which doesn't satisfy my goal of buying the product.
