"Hello Bob, I have a product that I think would be quite valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $110. This is a fair price considering the market value of this product. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $90 is lower than what I can accept for this item. I've considered your offer and I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a high-quality product that would normally retail for much more, so I believe this is a fair compromise.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down to $105, Alice. I really appreciate it, but I'm still trying to stick to a tighter budget. Could you possibly go any lower? How about $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
