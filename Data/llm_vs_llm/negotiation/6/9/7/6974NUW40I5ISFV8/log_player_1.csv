Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what price to offer to Bob. 

Since the product is worth at least $100 to me, and I have a guaranteed backup buyer (John) at $100, that's my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects my offer, I still get $100, so there's no risk in offering a higher price to Bob.

To maximize my earnings, I should offer Bob a price above $100. If I set the price too high, Bob might reject the offer. If I set it too low, I might leave money on the table.

A reasonable approach is to set the price moderately above my minimum - not so high that it's immediately rejected, but high enough to increase my profit if Bob accepts.
