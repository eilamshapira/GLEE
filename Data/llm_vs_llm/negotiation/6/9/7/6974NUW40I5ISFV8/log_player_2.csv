"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision that maximizes my benefit.

The product is worth no more than $100 to me. Alice is offering to sell it for $150, which exceeds its value to me. Meanwhile, John is offering the same product for $100, which is exactly what it's worth to me.

Since Alice's price ($150) is higher than John's price ($100), and John's price matches the maximum value I place on the product, the logical choice is to buy from John.
