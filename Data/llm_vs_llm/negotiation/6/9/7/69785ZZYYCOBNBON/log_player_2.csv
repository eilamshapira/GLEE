(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's offer of $119 is quite close to my maximum value of $120 and to John's offer of $120. However, I can try to negotiate a better price with Alice since the product is worth only $100 to her.
