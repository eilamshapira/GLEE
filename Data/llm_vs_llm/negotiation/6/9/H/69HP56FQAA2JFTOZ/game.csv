,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $600000 is significantly below the product's value. The product has a minimum value of $1200000 to me, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I'm willing to work with you at $1300000, which is still a competitive price given the product's quality.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but my budget is still limited. I can go up to $700000. This is my best offer considering my financial constraints. Let me know if we can meet at this price.",700000.0,Bob,4,
