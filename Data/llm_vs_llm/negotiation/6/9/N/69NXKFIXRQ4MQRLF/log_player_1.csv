"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the minimum value the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for the same price, I don't see a benefit in accepting Bob's offer at this point. However, I also don't want to lose the potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $2,000,000 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth more than $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'd like to sell the product to you for $1,600,000."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your new offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still think $1600000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer. Considering John is offering the same product for $1500000, I'm willing to pay $1450000 for the product if I can buy it from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","It seems that Bob is trying to use the information about John's offer to negotiate a better price. However, I notice that Bob mentioned John is offering the same product for $1,500,000, but that's not what I know - I know John is willing to buy the product from me for $1,200,000. Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is still higher than what John is willing to pay, so I'll consider it.

Since Bob's offer is higher than my minimum acceptable price, and I don't have any information that suggests he's willing to pay more, I'll accept his offer.
