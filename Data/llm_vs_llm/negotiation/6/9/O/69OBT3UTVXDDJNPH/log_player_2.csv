"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Considering its quality and rarity, I'm offering it to you for $14000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer ($14,000) is higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000), there's no reason to accept it or continue negotiating. The best decision is to buy from John.
