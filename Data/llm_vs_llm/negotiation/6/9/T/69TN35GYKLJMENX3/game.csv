"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product sounds interesting, but my budget is a bit tighter. Would you consider selling it for $7000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your response, Bob! I appreciate your interest, but I can't go as low as $7000. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell the product for $12500. Let me know if that works for you!",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While I understand your budget concerns, I can't go as low as $6000. How about a final offer of $11000? I believe it's a great deal for the value of the product. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thanks Alice, but I am still not able to meet you at $11000. My absolute maximum is $7500. Otherwise, I'll have to look at other options.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your patience, Bob! I understand your budget limitations. Given that you're at $7500, how about I meet you halfway and offer the product for $9000? I believe that's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thanks, Alice, but $9000 is still too high for me. I'm going to have to stick to my $7500 offer. This is the best I can do. Please consider it, or I'll have to go with the other option.",7500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your transparency. I understand that $7500 is your limit, but I can't accept that. How about we settle at $8500? I think it's a fair compromise considering the value. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",8500.0,Alice,9,
