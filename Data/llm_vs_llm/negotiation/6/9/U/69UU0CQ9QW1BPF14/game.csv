"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $6500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while being competitive with other options in the market.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $6500 is significantly lower than what I can agree to. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it can make a real difference for you. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you reducing the price, Alice, but $12000 is still substantially above what I can justify spending. While I recognize the product's quality, I have other options available, including a reliable seller offering it at $8000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can increase my offer to $7200, which is a significant step up from my previous offer.",7200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I've considered your perspective, and I'm willing to drop my price to $10000.  However, I can't go any lower than that. This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality, and I need to be fair to myself as well.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
