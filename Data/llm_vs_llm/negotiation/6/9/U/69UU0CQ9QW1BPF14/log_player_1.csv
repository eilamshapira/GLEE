Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I can offer $6500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while being competitive with other options in the market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it can make a real difference for you. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you reducing the price, Alice, but $12000 is still substantially above what I can justify spending. While I recognize the product's quality, I have other options available, including a reliable seller offering it at $8000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can increase my offer to $7200, which is a significant step up from my previous offer.
