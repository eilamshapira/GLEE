Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value of $10,000 that the product is worth to me, and also lower than my initial offer, I will reject Bob's offer. I will make a counteroffer in hopes of finding a mutually agreeable price.

My counteroffer is $18,000.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's new offer of $2,000 is still far below the minimum value of $10,000 that the product is worth to me. Since his offer is not significantly closer to my previous counteroffer of $18,000, and considering I have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000, I will reject Bob's offer again. However, I will also consider the fact that negotiating further might not yield a significantly better offer from Bob, given the large gap between our valuations.

My decision is to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, trying to meet somewhere in the middle but still above the $10,000 threshold.

My counteroffer is $15,000.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new offer is: {""product_price"": 15000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $3,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $3,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $3,000 is still significantly lower than my previous counteroffer of $15,000 and the minimum value of $10,000 that the product is worth to me. Given that Bob's offers have been incrementally increasing but are still far from my acceptable range, and considering I have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000, I will reject Bob's offer.

At this point, it seems unlikely that Bob will meet my minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation may not be fruitful. Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me a sale at a price that meets my minimum value, which is higher than any offer Bob has made.

My decision is: {""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
