Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth at least $15,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $15,000
3. Since Bob doesn't know about John's offer, and I don't know Bob's maximum value, I should aim higher
4. If Bob rejects, I lose nothing as I can still sell to John
5. It's reasonable to set a significantly higher price to maximize potential profit
