"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $5000000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1000000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $3000000?",3000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $3000000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1500000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to negotiate further. $1500000 is still a little low for me given the product's potential, but I am willing to meet you at $2250000. This offer is final.",2250000.0,Alice,5,
