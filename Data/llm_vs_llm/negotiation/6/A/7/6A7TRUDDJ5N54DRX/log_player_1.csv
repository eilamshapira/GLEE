Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive rights to this exceptional product. Considering its unique qualities and potential, I'm offering it to you for $5,000,000."", ""product_price"": 5000000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $5000000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $3,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $3000000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1500000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a tough one. Bob is inching up, but still quite a ways off from where I'd like to be. However, I also don't want to lose this opportunity completely. My internal valuation is $1,000,000, so any profit is a win.

I'm going to try one more counteroffer, pushing a little harder, but also aware of the risk of losing the deal entirely.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my next counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to negotiate further. $1,500,000 is still a little low for me given the product's potential, but I am willing to meet you at $2,250,000. This offer is final."", ""product_price"": 2250000}"
