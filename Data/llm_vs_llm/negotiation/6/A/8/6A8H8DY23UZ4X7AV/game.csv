"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $1750000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth and I'm open to negotiations.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $1750000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1650000. This price takes into account the product's value and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm open to further discussions to find a mutually beneficial price.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1650000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1400000.  Let's try to bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and John's offer, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I'll offer the product to you for $1575000. If this doesn't work for you, I may need to consider other options.",1575000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1575000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm offering $1500000.  This is my final offer. If we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to look at other options.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
