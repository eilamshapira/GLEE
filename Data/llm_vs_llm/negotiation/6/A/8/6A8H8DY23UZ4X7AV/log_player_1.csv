Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth and I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $1750000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still below the product's value to me and John's offer, I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,650,000. This price takes into account the product's value and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm open to further discussions to find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1650000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $1650000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1400000.  Let's try to bridge the gap and finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Although Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to my target price, it's still below John's offer of $1,500,000. I'll reject it and make another counteroffer to try to get a better price from Bob. If the negotiation doesn't improve, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and John's offer, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I'll offer the product to you for $1,575,000. If this doesn't work for you, I may need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1575000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1575000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm offering $1500000.  This is my final offer. If we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to look at other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches John's offer, and Bob has stated that this is his final offer, I'll accept it. There's no benefit in continuing the negotiation, and I can finalize the deal with Bob at the same price I would have gotten from John."
