"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is lower than the minimum value of $12,000 that the product is worth to me, and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer. However, I still want to try to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Therefore, I will proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

My counteroffer is: $14,000

So, my decision is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} and I'll wait for Bob's response to my counteroffer."

However, I notice that Bob is increasing his offer, which suggests that he is interested in the product and may be willing to pay more.

I will proceed to the next round with a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous one, to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price.
