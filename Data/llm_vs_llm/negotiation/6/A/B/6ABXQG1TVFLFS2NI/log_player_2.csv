"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll analyze this offer carefully:

- The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
- Alice's offer is $14,500
- John is willing to sell for $15,000
- Alice's cost is $12,000, so she has room to negotiate

Alice's current offer saves me $500 compared to John's price, but I believe there's room for a better deal since Alice's cost is $12,000. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but gives me more savings while still allowing Alice to make a profit above her $12,000 cost.

{""product_price"": $13,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll analyze Alice's new offer:

- Alice has come down $500 from her initial offer of $14,500 to $14,000
- This is $1,000 less than John's price of $15,000
- Alice's cost is $12,000, so she still has room to negotiate further
- We've only used 3 of our 10 rounds

Alice is showing willingness to negotiate by reducing her price. This is a positive sign, but I believe we can still get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer slightly to show I'm negotiating in good faith while still trying to get a good deal.

{""product_price"": $13,300}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll analyze Alice's latest offer:

- Alice has reduced her price again to $13,800, down $200 from her previous offer
- She's now $1,200 below John's price of $15,000
- There's still a $1,800 margin between her cost ($12,000) and this offer
- We've used 5 of our 10 rounds, so we're halfway through our negotiation window

Alice continues to move toward a middle ground. She's showing flexibility by reducing her price each round. I still think there's room for a better deal, but I need to be strategic with my counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer again to show I'm moving toward a middle ground while still trying to get a good deal.
