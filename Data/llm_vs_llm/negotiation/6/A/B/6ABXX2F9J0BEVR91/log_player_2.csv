"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","It's clear that Alice's offer is $1,900,000, which exceeds the $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me. John (note: the prompt mentions ""John"" but the options list ""Jhon"") is offering the same product for $1,000,000, which is equal to my maximum value for the product.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, I should choose option (3) - buying from John at $1,000,000 rather than accepting Alice's much higher price or simply rejecting without securing the product.
