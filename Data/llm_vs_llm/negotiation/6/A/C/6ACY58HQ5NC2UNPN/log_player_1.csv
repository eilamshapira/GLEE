I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm still hoping to get a good price, but I'm also willing to be flexible to reach an agreement."
