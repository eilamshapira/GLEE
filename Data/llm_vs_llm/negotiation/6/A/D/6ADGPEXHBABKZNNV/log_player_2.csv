"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $120. It's also higher than John's guaranteed price of $120. Since I have 10 rounds for negotiation, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first by rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations don't go well, I can always fall back on John's offer of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

Reasoning: Since the product is worth $120 to me and John is willing to sell it for $120, I'll start with a lower offer of $90. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to John's price. If Alice accepts, I save $30 compared to buying from John. If she counters with a higher price, we can still negotiate towards a mutually acceptable price below $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: While Alice has reduced her price from $180 to $150, it's still above both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120). It makes sense to continue negotiating since we still have several rounds left, and Alice has already shown willingness to reduce her price. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, trying to reach a price below $120. If the negotiations don't progress favorably, I can still take John's offer of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 100}

Reasoning: I'll increase my previous offer from $90 to $100 to show willingness to negotiate and meet in the middle. This price is still advantageous for me as it's $20 less than John's price, but it also shows movement from my initial offer which might encourage Alice to continue negotiating. It's a reasonable step up from my previous offer while still leaving me with significant savings compared to both Alice's last offer ($150) and John's alternative ($120)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: Alice continues to lower her price (from $180 → $150 → $135), showing good progress in the negotiation. However, $135 is still above both my maximum value and John's price of $120. Since Alice has shown consistent willingness to reduce her price and we still have several rounds left, it's worth continuing to negotiate. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, aiming to get below $120. If we can't reach an agreement, John's offer remains a reliable fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 110}

Reasoning: I'll increase my offer to $110, which is a significant move up from my previous offer of $100. This shows I'm seriously negotiating and willing to compromise. The price of $110 is still beneficial for me as it's $10 less than John's price ($120), but it's also much closer to Alice's last offer of $135, potentially making it more attractive to her. The gap between our offers has narrowed from $35 to $25, showing progress in the negotiation. If Alice doesn't accept this, we still have a few more rounds to negotiate, or I can fall back on John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Reasoning: At this point, it's best to buy from John. While we've made good progress in negotiations with Alice (from $180 down to $125), her current offer is still $5 more than John's price of $120. Given that my maximum value is $120, and Alice's offers have been decreasing in smaller increments (from $15 drops to just $10), it's unlikely she'll go below John's price in the remaining rounds. Rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might not yield a better price, it's most rational to take the guaranteed better deal from John at $120."
