"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to negotiate a bit. How about we settle on $1300000 for the product?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in negotiating. While $1300000 is a start, it's still below what this product is worth. I can come down from my initial offer, but I believe $1400000 is a more reasonable price given the product's value and quality. This represents a $50000 reduction from my initial offer, showing my willingness to work with you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your latest offer and your continued interest in negotiating. While $1250000 shows movement in the right direction, I need to emphasize that this product has significant value. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle - I can offer it for $1375000. This represents a substantial reduction from my initial price and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I notice you're holding firm at $1250000, but I want to be transparent - I have another interested buyer at $1200000. However, I'd prefer to work with you. I can come down to $1350000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value. This is my best offer so far, and it represents a significant reduction from where we started. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
