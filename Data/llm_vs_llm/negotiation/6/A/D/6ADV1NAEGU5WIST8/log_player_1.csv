"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I know would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,450,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to negotiate a bit. How about we settle on $1300000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since there's still room for negotiation and Bob's offer is relatively close to my initial price, I'll make a counteroffer. Bob's current offer of $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) than to the product's value to him ($1,500,000), so I believe there's potential to reach a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in negotiating. While $1,300,000 is a start, it's still below what this product is worth. I can come down from my initial offer, but I believe $1,400,000 is a more reasonable price given the product's value and quality. This represents a $50,000 reduction from my initial offer, showing my willingness to work with you."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I understand your position, but I can offer $1250000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. While Bob has moved somewhat from his previous position, there's still room for negotiation. His current offer of $1,250,000 is only slightly above John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000, and significantly below the product's value to him ($1,500,000). With six rounds remaining, there's still opportunity to reach a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your latest offer and your continued interest in negotiating. While $1,250,000 shows movement in the right direction, I need to emphasize that this product has significant value. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle - I can offer it for $1,375,000. This represents a substantial reduction from my initial price and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1375000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility with the pricing. To move things forward, I can offer $1250000 for the product. This is the best I can do at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer as Bob hasn't moved from his previous position of $1,250,000, showing he might be taking a hard stance. However, with four rounds remaining and knowing the product is worth $1,500,000 to him, there's still room for negotiation. I'll make another counteroffer, but I'll need to be more strategic as we're past the halfway point in our negotiation rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I notice you're holding firm at $1,250,000, but I want to be transparent - I have another interested buyer at $1,200,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you. I can come down to $1,350,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value. This is my best offer so far, and it represents a significant reduction from where we started. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I understand your position, and while I truly appreciate your offer of $1350000, I can only go up to $1300000 at this time. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,300,000. While this is lower than my ideal price, it's better than John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000. With only two rounds remaining and Bob showing some movement from his previous position ($1,250,000 to $1,300,000), it's prudent to secure this deal now rather than risk ending up with the lower offer from John."
