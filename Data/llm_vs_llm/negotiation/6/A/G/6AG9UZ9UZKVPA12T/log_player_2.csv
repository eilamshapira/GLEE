"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","If I'm looking for a product that is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it to me for exactly $1,000,000, while Alice is offering it for $1,500,000, the economically rational decision would be to buy from John.

Alice's price ($1,500,000) exceeds both my maximum valuation and John's price, so there's no reason to accept her offer.
