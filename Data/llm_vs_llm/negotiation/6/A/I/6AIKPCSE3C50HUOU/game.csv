"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must say that $60 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $110. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but $110 is still beyond my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $70?",70.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price.

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you're offering. Considering the product's value and my costs, I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $90. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",90.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for the updated offer, Alice. I appreciate your consideration, but $90 is still out of my budget. How about we agree on $80? I think this is a fair compromise for both of us.",80.0,Bob,8,
