"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is quite limited. I can offer you $60 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget is limited, but $60 is far below what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great deal for you. Let's try to meet in the middle.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Given my budget constraints, I'm willing to increase my offer to $70. I hope we can agree on this.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $110.  This is a good price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.",110.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you are trying to find a suitable price, Alice. However, my budget is really tight. My best and final offer is $80, which matches what I can get it for elsewhere. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",80.0,Bob,6,
