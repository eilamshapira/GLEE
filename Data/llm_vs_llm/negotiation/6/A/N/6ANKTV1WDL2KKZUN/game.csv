"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. It's valued at no less than $15000 to me, but I'm open to negotiation. I'm offering it to you for $20000.  Let me know what you think.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $16000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. I can stretch my budget to $13500. Is this something you can consider?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate you trying to work with me. Let's try $14500. This is closer to my value, but I'm also trying to make this deal work for you.",14500.0,Alice,5,
