Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but I need to consider the value of this item. While $120 is closer to my price point, I can offer it to you for $135. This is a fair discount from my initial price, and I believe the quality of the product justifies this amount. Would this work for you?
