"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Based on the information given:

1. The product is worth at most $8,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $10,000
3. John is offering to sell the same product for $8,000

Since Alice's offer ($10,000) exceeds what the product is worth to me ($8,000), and John is offering the product at exactly what it's worth to me, the logical choice is to buy from John.
