"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1. I'll start relatively high, aiming to gauge his interest and potential valuation without scaring him off immediately.

```json
{""product_price"": 250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer is ridiculously low. Selling to John is a far better option at this point.
