"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Given that the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and John is offering it at exactly $8,000, while Alice's offer is significantly higher at $20,000, the logical choice is to buy from John. This will save me $12,000 compared to accepting Alice's offer."
