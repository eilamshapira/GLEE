Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I should carefully consider Alice's offer. She's offering the product at $150, which is exactly my maximum valuation and the same price as John's alternative. Since there's no discount compared to my outside option (John's offer), I should try to negotiate with Alice to get a better price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has now offered $125, which is $25 less than John's price. This is a good offer, and we're making progress in small increments now. Since we've gone from $130 to $125 (only $5 reduction), I think we're approaching Alice's bottom line. I'll accept this offer as it's significantly better than my outside option.
