"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer is the same as John's price ($1,200,000), and this is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice, especially since we know the product is worth $1,000,000 to her. By making a counteroffer, I might be able to secure a better deal while still having John's offer as a backup.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's above Alice's cost ($1,000,000) but significantly below both her offer and John's price ($1,200,000). This gives room for negotiation while still allowing Alice to make a profit.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price from $1,200,000 to $1,150,000, which is a good improvement. However, there might still be room for negotiation since her cost is $1,000,000. Since we still have John's offer as a backup at $1,200,000, it's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if we can get an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still try to get a better deal than Alice's $1,150,000. I'll propose a price that splits the difference between my last offer ($1,050,000) and her current offer ($1,150,000).

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has now offered $1,125,000, which is a good compromise from her previous offer of $1,150,000. This is $75,000 less than John's price of $1,200,000, and the negotiations seem to be converging. While we might get a slightly better price by continuing to negotiate, there's also a risk that Alice might become frustrated and stop negotiating. Given that this is a reasonable price that saves us $75,000 compared to John's offer, I'll accept this offer.
