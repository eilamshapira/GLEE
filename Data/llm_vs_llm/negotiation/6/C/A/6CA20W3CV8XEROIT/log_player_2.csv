"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $100, Alice's offer of $150 is not attractive. I should either reject and make a counteroffer or buy from John directly.

Since we have 10 rounds available for negotiation and Alice might be willing to lower her price significantly, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.
