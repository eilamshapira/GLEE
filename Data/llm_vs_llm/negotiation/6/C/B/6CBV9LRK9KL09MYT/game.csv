"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $1000000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $1250000? This would allow me to proceed with the sale and still be within a reasonable margin.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1250000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is my final offer, as I can always purchase the product from John for $1000000.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
