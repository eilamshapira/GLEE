"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is already below my maximum budget of $1,200,000, it's a good starting point. However, I'd like to try to negotiate a better price to save as much money as possible.

Given that I have 10 rounds to negotiate and the first offer is already quite favorable, I'll choose to reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to see if I can get an even better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To make a strategic counteroffer, I'll start by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range. This will give us room to negotiate and potentially meet in the middle.

My counteroffer will be $800,000. This is a decrease of $200,000 from Alice's initial offer, which should encourage her to reconsider her price without being too aggressive.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $950,000 is still below my maximum budget of $1,200,000, but it's closer to her initial offer than I had hoped. Since she rejected my counteroffer of $800,000, it suggests that she may not be willing to go as low as I had proposed.

However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price. Given that we're only in Round 3 and I have 7 more rounds to go, I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer.

This time, I'll aim for a price that's between my previous offer and Alice's new offer. A reasonable counteroffer could be $875,000, which is $75,000 lower than Alice's current offer but $75,000 higher than my previous offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still pushing for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(Note: The next step would be to send the counteroffer of $875,000 to Alice, but based on the provided format, it seems the decision to reject and the counteroffer details are to be communicated separately.)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","As previously decided, my counteroffer to Alice will be $875,000. This price reflects a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest proposal, indicating my willingness to negotiate while aiming for the best possible deal.
