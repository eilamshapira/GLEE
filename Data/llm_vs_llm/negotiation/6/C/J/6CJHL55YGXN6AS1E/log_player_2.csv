"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. Based on its quality and features, I'm offering it at $25000. This is a premium product with excellent capabilities that I believe will serve your needs well. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Based on the information, Alice's offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than the product's worth to me ($12,000) and also higher than John's guaranteed price of $12,000. There's no reason to accept this offer or continue negotiating when I can get the same product at a much better price.
