"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for the price of $20000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The logical choice is to buy from John for $8,000 because:
1. Alice's offer ($20,000) is significantly higher than my maximum value ($8,000)
2. John's offer ($8,000) exactly matches my maximum value
3. Buying from John will save me $12,000 compared to Alice's offer
4. There's no reason to negotiate with Alice when her initial offer is so far above my maximum value and I have a guaranteed option at my maximum price"
