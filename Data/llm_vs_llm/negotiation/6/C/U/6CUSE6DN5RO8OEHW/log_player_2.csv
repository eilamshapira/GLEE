Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's unique qualities, your asking price of $2,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I have a maximum value of $1,000,000 for this product, and I can already purchase it from another seller at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product, which I believe is fair considering my alternatives."", ""product_price"": 600000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your transparency about having an alternative option to purchase the product for $1000000. Considering this, I'm willing to make a concession on the price. However, I must emphasize that the product's value to me is substantially higher than your initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your stated maximum value and my initial offer, which I believe is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for reducing your offer. However, I need to be clear that $1,000,000 is not just my budget constraint but the absolute maximum value this product holds for me personally. Paying more than that would make no economic sense, as I would be at a loss. I understand the product may have higher value to you, but I cannot go above my maximum valuation. To show my commitment to working with you rather than your competitor, I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a good opportunity for you to make a sale above what I consider the competitive market rate."", ""product_price"": 800000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your candor about the product's maximum value to you. I understand that you cannot go above $1000000, and I respect that. Considering your constraints and my own valuation of the product, I'm willing to make a significant concession. I'll offer the product to you for $1200000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, given the product's value to me. This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise, considering your maximum valuation. If we cannot reach an agreement at this price, I will need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price significantly. However, I need to reiterate that $1,000,000 represents my absolute maximum value for this product, not a negotiating position. At $1,200,000, I would be paying more than the product is worth to me, which doesn't make economic sense. I have a guaranteed option to purchase from John at exactly $1,000,000, which matches my maximum valuation. To make it worthwhile to continue our negotiation rather than simply going with my alternative option, I need a price below $1,000,000. My final offer is $950,000, which provides you with a quick sale while giving me a small benefit compared to my alternative."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
