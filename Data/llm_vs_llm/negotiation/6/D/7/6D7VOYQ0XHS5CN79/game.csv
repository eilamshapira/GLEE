"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe the product is valuable, but $14000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I think this is a reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, after considering your counteroffer, I'm willing to lower my price to $13000. This is a considerable discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both parties. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price to $13000. However, I'm still looking to get a better deal. Considering my initial offer and your latest counteroffer, I'd like to propose a price of $10500. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",10500.0,Bob,4,
