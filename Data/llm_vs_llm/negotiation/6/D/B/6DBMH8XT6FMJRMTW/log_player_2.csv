It's always worth exploring options.  I can save at least $100,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly low offer, but it's still within my budget and significantly lower than Alice's offer. This will hopefully give us a good starting point for negotiation."

Alice has moved a bit, but I'm still not at the price point I'm looking for.  Let's see if we can close the gap a little more."

This is the price Alice is willing to sell for, I think we can close the deal at this point."
