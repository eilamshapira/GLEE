"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10000 for the product, considering my budget and other available options. Would you be willing to sell it to me at this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $10000 is too low for the value this product provides. I have other interested buyers willing to pay significantly more. Given your interest, I can reduce my initial asking price to $22000. This is a considerable reduction from my first offer and reflects the product's true value. Would you be willing to consider this price?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price, but $22000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $12000, which is a compromise considering my initial offer and your reduced price. Would you be willing to consider this price?",12000.0,Bob,4,
