Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $25,000. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10000 for the product, considering my budget and other available options. Would you be willing to sell it to me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer because $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 (which I can get from John), but I want to continue negotiating with Bob as there might be potential for a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $10,000 is too low for the value this product provides. I have other interested buyers willing to pay significantly more. Given your interest, I can reduce my initial asking price to $22,000. This is a considerable reduction from my first offer and reflects the product's true value. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price, but $22000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $12000, which is a compromise considering my initial offer and your reduced price. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John because Bob's offer of $12,000 is still below John's guaranteed $15,000, and based on Bob's negotiation pattern, it seems unlikely he'll reach a price above $15,000. It's better to secure the guaranteed higher amount from John rather than continue negotiations that may not yield a better result."
