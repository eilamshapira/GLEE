"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have an excellent product that I believe you will find very valuable. I'm offering it to you at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to consider my options carefully:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $200
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $80

Alice is offering the product for $200, which is well above the maximum value of $80 that the product is worth to me. John is offering the exact same product for $80, which matches the maximum I value it at.

There's no reason for me to accept Alice's much higher offer when I can get the same product at my maximum valuation from John.
