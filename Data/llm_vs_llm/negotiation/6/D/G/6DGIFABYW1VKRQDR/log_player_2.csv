"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given the information provided, I need to make a decision that maximizes my value.

Alice is offering the product for $150, which exceeds the $100 maximum value the product is worth to me.

John is offering the same product for $100, which equals exactly the maximum value I place on the product.

Since Alice's price ($150) exceeds the value I place on the product ($100), and John's price ($100) equals my maximum valuation, the rational choice is to buy from John.
