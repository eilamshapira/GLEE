Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I will make a counteroffer that is still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, in an attempt to find a mutually agreeable price.

My counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and worth. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the reduction in price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Since Bob's offer of $750,000 is still lower than what I'm willing to accept, and I have a better offer from John, I will reject Bob's offer. However, I will make one more attempt to negotiate with Bob before considering selling to John.

My counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the continued reduction in price, but I'm still above my budget. Considering your hint at considering other options, I'm willing to make a serious compromise. I was thinking more along the lines of $825000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. If we can't meet at this price, I may need to explore other options as well.

Considering Bob's final offer of $825,000 and his statement that it's the highest he's willing to go, I believe we've reached an impasse in the negotiations. Since John is willing to buy the product for $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer, I've decided to sell the product to John. This will ensure that I get the best possible price for the product."
