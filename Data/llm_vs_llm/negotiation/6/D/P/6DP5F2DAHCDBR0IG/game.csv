"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1300000 is fair. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is a bit high for me. This product would be valuable to my business, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but the value this product brings is substantial. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1175000?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1175000 is getting closer, but it's still a touch high for my budget. How about we settle at $1100000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm aiming for a deal that benefits us both. While I recognize your position, the product's inherent value necessitates a price that reflects its worth. I could consider coming down to $1140000. This is my final offer.",1140000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, and I'm willing to be a serious buyer. However, $1140000 is really pushing my budget to the limit.  If you're willing to meet me at $1110000, I'm ready to close this deal today.",1110000.0,Bob,6,
