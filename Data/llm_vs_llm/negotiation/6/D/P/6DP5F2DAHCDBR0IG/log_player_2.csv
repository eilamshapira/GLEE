While Alice is moving closer to a more reasonable price, I think there's still room for negotiation before considering John's offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,175,000 is getting closer, but it's still a touch high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,100,000? I think that's a fair compromise."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a deal that benefits us both. While I recognize your position, the product's inherent value necessitates a price that reflects its worth. I could consider coming down to $1140000. This is my final offer.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,140,000

This is a tough one. Alice is implying this is her final offer, but it's still a significant amount above John's price. I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to $1,100,000."
