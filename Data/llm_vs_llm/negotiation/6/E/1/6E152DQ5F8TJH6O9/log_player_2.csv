"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I know the value of this product to you is $800000, and while its minimum value to me is $1000000, I'm open to negotiating. How about we start with an offer of $1200000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly above my maximum value
3. John is offering the product at $800,000, which matches my maximum value
4. Alice's starting position is very high, and even her minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) is above my maximum value

There's no reason to accept Alice's high offer or continue negotiations when John's offer matches my maximum value. The gap between Alice's minimum ($1,000,000) and my maximum ($800,000) means we won't reach a deal that benefits both parties.
