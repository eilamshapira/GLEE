"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  I'm confident this product has the potential to significantly benefit your business.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000.  This is a fair price considering the potential benefits I see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1000000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $1200000?  This would be a fair price that reflects the value of the product while giving us both a good deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
