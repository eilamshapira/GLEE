Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000.  This is a fair price considering the potential benefits I see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
