Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential benefits I see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1000000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $1,200,000?  This would be a fair price that reflects the value of the product while giving us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
