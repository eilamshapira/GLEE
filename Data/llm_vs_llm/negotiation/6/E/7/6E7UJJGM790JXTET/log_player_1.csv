Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze this situation:

1) The product is worth $15,000 to me (my reservation price)
2) The product is worth $10,000 to Bob (his maximum valuation)
3) If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for $15,000 (my guaranteed backup option)

Since Bob values the product at $10,000, any price above that will be rejected. Given that I have a guaranteed option to sell to John for $15,000, which is my reservation price, there's no reason for me to offer Bob a price below $15,000.

In this case, since Bob's maximum valuation ($10,000) is less than my reservation price ($15,000), we don't have a viable zone of agreement. I should proceed with my alternative option of selling to John.
