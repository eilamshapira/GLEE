Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking for a more competitive price. Would you be willing to consider $800000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer is at the minimum value I'm willing to accept, and I have the option to sell to John for the same price, I'll consider my next move carefully. However, I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate, and I believe the product is worth more to Bob than he's letting on. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.
