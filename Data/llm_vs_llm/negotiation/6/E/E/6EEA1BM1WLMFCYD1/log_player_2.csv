"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $95. This is a quality product that's worth the investment. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I should not accept Alice's offer of $95 since it's higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80). Since John is offering the product at exactly $80, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay, I could try to negotiate with Alice first to see if I can get a better price.

However, given that Alice's initial offer ($95) is significantly above both my maximum value and John's price, and Alice mentioned the product is worth $80 to her, it might be more efficient to simply buy from John rather than going through potentially lengthy negotiations.
