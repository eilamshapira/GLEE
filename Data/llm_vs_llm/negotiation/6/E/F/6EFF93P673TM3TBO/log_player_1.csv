Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm open to negotiations if you have a different valuation in mind."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I'm currently working with a budget. I'm prepared to offer $900000 for it. I hope we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is below the minimum value I'm willing to accept ($1,200,000), and I have a better alternative with John, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price. 

Here's my counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe this price better reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"

Since Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below the minimum value I'm willing to accept from John ($1,200,000), I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price. However, considering Bob's budget constraints, I will try to make a more reasonable offer.

Here's my counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. I'm willing to consider $1,500,000 as a compromise. If this is still out of your budget, I'm open to further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
