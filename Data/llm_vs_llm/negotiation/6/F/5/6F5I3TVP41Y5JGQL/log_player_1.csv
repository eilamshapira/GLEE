Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm aiming to stay within a budget of $15000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is the minimum value I have for the product, and selling it to John would also be for $12,000, I don't see a benefit in selling to John over accepting Bob's offer directly. However, I would like to try to negotiate a better price with Bob if possible. But given that Bob's offer is already at my minimum acceptable price, the risk of losing the sale by countering might not be worth it. Therefore, the safest option to ensure I sell the product without risking further negotiation is to accept Bob's offer.
