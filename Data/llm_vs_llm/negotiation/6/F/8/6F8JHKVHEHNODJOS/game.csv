"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $3000000 is far beyond my budget for this product. While I acknowledge its unique qualities, I'm only prepared to offer a price that aligns with my valuation. I can offer $500000.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $3000000 may be out of your budget, but I believe the product's unique qualities and value warrant a higher price than $500000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to counteroffer at $2000000, which I think is more reflective of the product's worth.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
