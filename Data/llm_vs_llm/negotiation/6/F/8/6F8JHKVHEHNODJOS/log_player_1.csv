Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $3000000 is far beyond my budget for this product. While I acknowledge its unique qualities, I'm only prepared to offer a price that aligns with my valuation. I can offer $500000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $500,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and I believe the product is worth more. My counteroffer will be $2,000,000. This price still reflects the product's value but shows a willingness to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $3,000,000 may be out of your budget, but I believe the product's unique qualities and value warrant a higher price than $500,000.
