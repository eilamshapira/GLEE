Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $3000000 may be out of your budget, but I believe the product's unique qualities and value warrant a higher price than $500000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to counteroffer at $2000000, which I think is more reflective of the product's worth.
