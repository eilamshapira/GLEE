"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is higher than the minimum amount I'm willing to accept ($800,000) but lower than my initial offer, I'll try to negotiate further to get a better price.

My counteroffer is: $925,000

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $875,000 is still lower than my previous counteroffer, but getting closer to a reasonable price, I'll try to negotiate further. However, I'll also consider the risk of Bob walking away and the certainty of selling to John for $800,000.

My next counteroffer will be slightly lower than my previous one, to show that I'm willing to compromise.

My counteroffer is: $912,500

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to my target price, and I've already made a few concessions, I'll consider accepting this offer. While it's still a bit lower than I had hoped, it's a significant amount higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($800,000), and I don't want to risk losing the sale by being too inflexible.

My decision is to accept Bob's offer.
