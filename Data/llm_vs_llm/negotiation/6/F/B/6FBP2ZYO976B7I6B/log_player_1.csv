"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its unique features and value, I'm willing to let it go for $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is out of my budget. I can offer you $10000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Considering Bob's offer and my options, I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer. $10,000 is far too low.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, considering the product's value and the effort involved, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?"", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17500 is still above my budget. I can offer you $11000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","$11,000 is still too low. I need to make a decision that maximizes my profit. I could try to squeeze more out of Bob, but I'm starting to feel like he's not going to budge much higher. I also don't want to waste too much time and risk getting even less. Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit that's better than risking more rounds with Bob.
