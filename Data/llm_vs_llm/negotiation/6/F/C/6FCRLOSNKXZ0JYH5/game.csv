"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $12000 is a bit steep for my budget. Given the market conditions, I would be comfortable paying $9500, which I believe is a fair price that would work well for both of us. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $9500 is below what I can accept for this product. I'm willing to come down to $11000, which I believe still offers great value considering the benefits you'll receive. Let me know your thoughts.",11000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see where you're coming from with your budget, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? This price reflects a significant discount while still recognizing the product's worth. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving on the price, Alice. Your product is definitely valuable, and I want to make this work. Could we settle at $10000? That would be a price point that works well for my budget while still providing good value for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
