"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Looking at the options, I'm considering what would be the best decision for me as Bob.

Alice's offer is for the product at $8,000, which is exactly the maximum amount I'm willing to pay for it (since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me).

If I reject Alice's offer, I would buy from John for the same price of $8,000.

Since both Alice's and John's offers are at the same price ($8,000), and this is my maximum valuation for the product, I'm indifferent between the two options. I'll accept Alice's offer since she presented it first.
