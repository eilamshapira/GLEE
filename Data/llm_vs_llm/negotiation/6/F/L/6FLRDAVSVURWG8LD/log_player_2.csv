"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to consider the value of the product to me and the options available.

The product is worth no more than $120 to me, meaning I'm not willing to spend more than that amount.

Alice's offer is $150, which exceeds my valuation of the product.

John is offering the same product for $120, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's price ($150) is higher than both my maximum valuation ($120) and John's alternative offer ($120), the rational decision is to buy from John.
