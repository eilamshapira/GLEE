Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has tremendous value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 5000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000 at this point. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the minimum value the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for the same price, I don't see a reason to negotiate further at this point. However, considering I have 8 more rounds to potentially get a better deal, it might be worth trying to negotiate a bit more.

But given the significant difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and considering I can get the same amount from John without the hassle of further negotiation, the safest choice that ensures I get at least the minimum value I'm willing to accept is to sell to John. This way, I avoid the risk of Bob walking away or not being able to reach a mutually agreeable price in the subsequent rounds.
