"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree your product seems unique, $20000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value is closer to that. I can offer you a slight discount, but $8000 is too low. I'd be willing to sell it to you for $18000.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $18000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Perhaps we can find a middle ground? How about $11000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $16000, which is a significant discount from my initial price. I hope this is more in line with your budget.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for continuing this with me. While $16000 is closer, I need to be a bit more budget-conscious. Would $11500 be agreeable to you?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understanding of my position. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you the product for $15500, which is as low as I'm comfortable going. If this works for you, I'm ready to finalize the sale.",15500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate that.  However, to make this work for me, I can't go any higher than $12000. That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,8,
