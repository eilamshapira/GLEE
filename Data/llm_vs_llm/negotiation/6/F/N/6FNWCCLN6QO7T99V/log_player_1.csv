Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree your product seems unique, $20000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. My counteroffer will be $18,000. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value is closer to that. I can offer you a slight discount, but $8,000 is too low. I'd be willing to sell it to you for $18,000.""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $18000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Perhaps we can find a middle ground? How about $11000?

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $11,000 is still below my desired price, but we're getting closer to a potential agreement. My counteroffer will be $16,000, which is slightly below my initial offer but still reflects the product's value.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'm willing to make another concession.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate that.  However, to make this work for me, I can't go any higher than $12000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Since Bob's final offer of $12,000 is still below the price I can get from John ($15,000), I've decided to sell the product to John. This ensures I get a better price for the product."
