"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this unique product. Based on its exceptional qualities and rarity, I'm willing to sell it to you for $2,500,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial price is far too high. I am interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower. I can offer you $750000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a tough one. $750,000 is below my minimum, but rejecting now opens the door to getting even less. I need to try and steer the price up.

My decision: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is unfortunately not feasible for me. Given the product's value, I can't go below $2,200,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, but $2200000 is still too expensive for me. My maximum budget for this product is $1000000. Considering that, I can offer you $850000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob is clearly lowballing me. $850,000 is even worse than his last offer, and I'm starting to feel I might not get a good price. But I still want to test if I can get a better price.

My decision: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're not quite on the same page regarding the product's value. However, I am willing to meet you in the middle. Considering that and because I am willing to come to an agreement, I am willing to lower the price to $2,000,000. That's the final offer."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2000000 is still far beyond my budget. I am at $850000, but I am willing to go up to $925000 as my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is not going well. Bob is very firm at a very low price. My minimum is $1,000,000. With each round, the chances of getting a good price decrease. I should cut my losses and take the sure deal.

My decision: {""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
