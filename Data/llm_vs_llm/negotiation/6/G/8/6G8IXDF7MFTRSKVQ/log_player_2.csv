"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to consider if Alice's offer of $20,000 is reasonable compared to my alternatives.

The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and John is offering it for exactly $15,000. Alice's offer of $20,000 exceeds both my maximum valuation and John's price.

Since Alice's offer is higher than both my maximum valuation and the guaranteed alternative from John, there's no reason to accept it or continue negotiating.
