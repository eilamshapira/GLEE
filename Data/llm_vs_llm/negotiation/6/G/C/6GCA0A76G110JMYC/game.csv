"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to lower my price to $20000. Let me know if this works for you.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate you lowering the price to $20000. However, I still think it's a bit out of my range. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. Given your budget constraints, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $15000? This price reflects the value of the product while considering your financial situation.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $15000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering I can get a similar product from John for $10000, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10500. This is a slight increase from John's price, reflecting the value I place on our negotiation and the potential benefits of working with you directly.",10500.0,Bob,6,
