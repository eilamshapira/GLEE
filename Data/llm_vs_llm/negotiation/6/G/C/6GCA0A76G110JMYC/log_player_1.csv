Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate you lowering the price to $20000. However, I still think it's a bit out of my range. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $15000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering I can get a similar product from John for $10000, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10500. This is a slight increase from John's price, reflecting the value I place on our negotiation and the potential benefits of working with you directly.
