"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the price is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, and I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're interested in the product, but I'm afraid $9000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'd like to offer the product to you for $13500, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe $13500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11250 for the product.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your willingness to meet me halfway. I appreciate your counteroffer of $11250. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a price that's slightly higher, considering the product's value. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $12750, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",12750.0,Alice,5,
