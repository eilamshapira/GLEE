Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the price is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, and I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $9,000 is lower than my minimum acceptable price. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe $13500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11250 for the product.

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $11,250 is still slightly lower than I'd like. Since Bob is willing to meet me halfway, I'll try to meet him halfway as well, but closer to my target price.

My counteroffer: $12,750"
