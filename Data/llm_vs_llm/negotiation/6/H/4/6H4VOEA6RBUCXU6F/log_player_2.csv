{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  I can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $12,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer and allows for potential negotiation. It's a reasonable price for me, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit."
