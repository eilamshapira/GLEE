"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $14,999
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: $15,000

The difference between Alice's and John's price is only $1. Although Alice's price is technically lower, the difference is negligible, and it seems Alice is trying to exploit the fact that John's price is my upper limit.

Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, there's room for a better deal. By rejecting this offer, I might encourage Alice to come back with a more reasonable price that's significantly lower than $15,000.
