"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is significantly higher than that, it doesn't make sense for me to accept her offer. Additionally, buying from John for $800,000 aligns with my budget and the value I place on the product. Therefore, the best decision is to buy the product from John.
