"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is too high for me. My budget is much lower. Would you consider $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $8000 is below our minimum acceptable price. I can go as low as $16000 for this premium product. Let me know if this works for you.",16000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is still below our minimum. I can lower the price to $15500, which is the best I can do. Let me know if you can work with this.",15500.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
