"Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested in buying it, but $300 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $50.",50.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your interest, Bob. $50 is far too low, as I value the product much higher. How about we meet in the middle? I can do $275.",275.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down from $300, but $275 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
