Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. I believe it would be a great value at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?,180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $180 is well above what I'm looking to spend for this product. I have another seller, John, who's offering it for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better deal. Would you consider $80 for the product?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $80 for this product. I know the market value of this product, and your offer is significantly below that. While I'd like to do business with you, I have other potential buyers willing to pay more. However, I can offer you the product for $150, which is already a reduction from my initial price and represents good value for the quality you're getting.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate that you've come down from your initial offer. However, $150 is still more than I can justify spending. I mentioned that I have another seller offering the same product for $100. To make it worth choosing you over them, I would need a better price. I can offer $90, which would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,4,
