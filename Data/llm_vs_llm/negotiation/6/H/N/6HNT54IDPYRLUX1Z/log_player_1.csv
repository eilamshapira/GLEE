Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. I believe it would be a great value at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $180 is well above what I'm looking to spend for this product. I have another seller, John, who's offering it for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better deal. Would you consider $80 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. While I appreciate his interest, $80 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I know John is actually willing to pay $120, not $100 as Bob claims. I'll continue negotiating to try to reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $80 for this product. I know the market value of this product, and your offer is significantly below that. While I'd like to do business with you, I have other potential buyers willing to pay more. However, I can offer you the product for $150, which is already a reduction from my initial price and represents good value for the quality you're getting."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate that you've come down from your initial offer. However, $150 is still more than I can justify spending. I mentioned that I have another seller offering the same product for $100. To make it worth choosing you over them, I would need a better price. I can offer $90, which would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $120. Bob's offers ($80 and $90) have remained below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and he seems unwilling to increase his offer significantly. Since I can guarantee $120 from John, and Bob's negotiating pattern suggests he won't reach this price point, it's best to take the sure deal with John rather than continue negotiations that may not be productive."
