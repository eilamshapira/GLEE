"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. I believe it would be a great value at $180. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to consider whether Alice's offer ($180) is worth it compared to John's offer of $100.

Since the product is only worth up to $100 to me, and John is offering it at exactly $100, Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than both the product's value to me and my alternative option.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $180 is well above what I'm looking to spend for this product. I have another seller, John, who's offering it for $100. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better deal. Would you consider $80 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 80}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $80 for this product. I know the market value of this product, and your offer is significantly below that. While I'd like to do business with you, I have other potential buyers willing to pay more. However, I can offer you the product for $150, which is already a reduction from my initial price and represents good value for the quality you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer of $150 against my alternatives.

The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and I can buy it from John for exactly $100. Alice's offer of $150 is still significantly higher than both the product's value to me and my alternative option with John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate that you've come down from your initial offer. However, $150 is still more than I can justify spending. I mentioned that I have another seller offering the same product for $100. To make it worth choosing you over them, I would need a better price. I can offer $90, which would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
