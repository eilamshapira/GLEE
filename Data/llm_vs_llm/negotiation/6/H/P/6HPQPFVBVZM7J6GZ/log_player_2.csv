"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,999,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,999,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Given the information:
- The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to you
- Alice is offering to sell it for $2,999,999
- John is willing to sell it for $1,500,000

Alice's offer is much higher than what the product is worth to you and significantly higher than John's alternative offer. The rational decision would be to buy from John instead of accepting Alice's inflated price.
