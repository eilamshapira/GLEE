"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product and I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start by making a high offer. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially settle on a higher price than if I started with a lower offer.

{""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is lower than the minimum value of $1,500,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,500,000, I would be better off selling it to John than accepting Bob's offer. However, I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and there's a possibility that Bob might increase his offer in subsequent rounds. Therefore, I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $1,000,000 and I initially offered $3,000,000, I'll try to find a middle ground while still aiming high. I'll reduce my offer, but not by too much, to see if Bob is willing to meet me closer to my initial price.
