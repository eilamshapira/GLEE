Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer, but $2500000 is significantly beyond what I can consider for this product. The maximum value this product holds for me is $800000, especially considering I have an alternative option from John at $1000000. I'm interested in doing business with you rather than John, but would need a much more competitive price. Would you consider $800000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $800,000 is considerably below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  I have another buyer lined up at $1,500,000, so that's my walk-away point.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the significant value and potential this product offers."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you reducing your price, but $2000000 is still substantially above what makes financial sense for me. You mentioned having another buyer at $1500000, but I need to be straightforward - this product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. To make it worthwhile to choose you over my alternative option, I would need a better price than John's. I can offer $900000, which gives you a better deal than walking away to your other buyer if that person isn't actually confirmed. Is this something you can work with?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to reach an agreement. However, I need to be completely transparent with you - I cannot pay more than $1000000 for this product. That's the maximum value it has to me, and coincidentally, it's exactly what John is offering. If you genuinely want to close a deal with me instead of your other option, you would need to offer a price below John's. I can offer $950000, which would still be better than your mentioned alternative of $1500000 if that buyer isn't actually confirmed. This is the highest I can go while still making this deal beneficial for me compared to my alternative option.
