"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offer is $140
2. I know the product is worth $120 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation
3. John's price is $150, which is my absolute maximum and worst-case scenario
4. Alice's current offer ($140) is better than John's price ($150)
5. However, since I know Alice's cost ($120), I should try to negotiate for a better price

Given these factors, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. Even if negotiations don't work out, I can always fall back to Alice's current offer or John's price later.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know Alice's cost is $120, I'll make a counteroffer that gives her some profit but is also more favorable to me. I'll offer $130, which gives Alice a $10 profit while saving me $20 compared to her initial offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice has moved down from $140 to $135, showing willingness to negotiate
2. The $135 price point is:
   - $15 more than Alice's cost ($120)
   - $15 less than John's price ($150)
   - Only $5 more than my last offer ($130)
3. While I could try another counteroffer, the risk is that Alice might not go much lower
4. $135 is a reasonable compromise between my $130 offer and Alice's original $140

Given that this is a fair middle ground and significantly better than John's price, I'll accept this offer.
