"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2000000 is well above my budget for this product. I know the market value of similar products, and I'd be willing to offer $1200000. This is a fair price that would work for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1800000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
