Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2000000 is well above my budget for this product. I know the market value of similar products, and I'd be willing to offer $1200000. This is a fair price that would work for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
