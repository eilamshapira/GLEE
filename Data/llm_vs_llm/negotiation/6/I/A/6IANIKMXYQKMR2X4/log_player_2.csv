"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $2000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is higher than both my maximum valuation ($1,500,000) and John's price ($1,500,000), it wouldn't be rational to accept this offer. I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,000,000 is well above my budget for this product. I know the market value of similar products, and I'd be willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price that would work for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1800000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's new offer of $1,800,000 is still higher than John's guaranteed price of $1,500,000, and higher than my maximum valuation, it makes more sense to buy from John. While we could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will come down to a price below $1,500,000, and we risk spending more time without achieving a better outcome.
