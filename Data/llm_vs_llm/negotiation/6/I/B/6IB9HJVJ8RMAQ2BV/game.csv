"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob, and thank you for your offer. While $120 is closer to what I'm looking for, I need to get a bit more for this product given its value. I can come down to $150, which I think is a fair middle ground between our positions. Would this work for you?",150.0,Alice,3,
