"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $180. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Given that Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate upward from $120, I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Since the difference between our positions isn't too large, there's potential to reach a better agreement than John's $100 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, and thank you for your offer. While $120 is closer to what I'm looking for, I need to get a bit more for this product given its value. I can come down to $150, which I think is a fair middle ground between our positions. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
