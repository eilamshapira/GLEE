Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This is a one-time offer."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** We start high, aiming slightly below Bob's perceived value to give the impression the product is truly valuable and leave room for negotiation if needed. 
* **""Exclusive opportunity"" and ""one-time offer"":**  These phrases create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Not revealing John's offer:**  We don't want Bob to know our backup plan, as it weakens our negotiating position.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
