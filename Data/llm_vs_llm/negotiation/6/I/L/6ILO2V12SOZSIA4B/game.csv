"Hello Bob, I'd like to offer you my product. It's a high-quality item that I'm currently selling for $100. This is actually a competitive price considering its value and features. Would you like to purchase it at this price?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $100 seems a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70? I think that's a fair price.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I can't accept $70 as the price is below my minimum acceptable value. I should mention that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $80 for the product. However, I'd prefer to sell it to you. How about we meet in the middle at $90? This is still well below the product's market value of $120.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice. How about we settle at $80?  That's the price your other interested buyer is willing to pay, and seems fair to both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $80, which matches what John is willing to pay. However, since the product is worth $120 to you, I believe there's room for a more mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to come down to $85, which allows you to still get excellent value while giving me a slightly better return than my alternative option. Does that work for you?",85.0,Alice,5,
