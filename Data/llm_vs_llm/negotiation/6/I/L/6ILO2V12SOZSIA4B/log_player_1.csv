Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $100 seems a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

However, since the product is worth $120 to you, I believe there's room for a more mutually beneficial agreement.
