"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'd like to offer you my product. It's a high-quality item that I'm currently selling for $100. This is actually a competitive price considering its value and features. Would you like to purchase it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's initial offer is too high. I'll try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I can't accept $70 as the price is below my minimum acceptable value. I should mention that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $80 for the product. However, I'd prefer to sell it to you. How about we meet in the middle at $90? This is still well below the product's market value of $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While Alice's tactic of mentioning another buyer is interesting, I'm not convinced. I'll try to push for a slightly better deal."

I am aiming to meet her at her minimum acceptable value, as indicated by her mention of another buyer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $80, which matches what John is willing to pay. However, since the product is worth $120 to you, I believe there's room for a more mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to come down to $85, which allows you to still get excellent value while giving me a slightly better return than my alternative option. Does that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is right, I'm willing to pay up to $120. Accepting $85 gives me a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the product or having to pay John's higher price."
