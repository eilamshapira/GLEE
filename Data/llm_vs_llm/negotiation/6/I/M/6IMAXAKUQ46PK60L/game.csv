"Hello Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this exceptional product at a price of $5000000. This is a one-time offer that I believe represents great value. Let me know if you're interested!",5000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $5000000 is way too high for me. This product might be worth a lot to someone, but I'm looking to spend significantly less.  Would you consider $100000?",100000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $100000 is significantly below my expectations for this product. I'm willing to come down to $3000000, considering your interest but also the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",3000000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $2000000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to work with you. What do you say?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $2000000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable paying.  To be honest, I'm looking at other options closer to $150000. If you can work with that, I'm ready to make a deal.",150000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I see that we're still quite far apart on the valuation. I'm willing to lower my price further to $1500000, which is a substantial discount from my previous offers. This is the best I can do while still recognizing the true value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",1500000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I believe this product offers significant value. I'm willing to go down to $1200000, which is my final offer before considering other options. This price reflects a deep discount and shows my commitment to making this deal work. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1200000 is still a bit steep, I'm willing to stretch my budget to $250000 if we can close the deal today.  This is my final offer. What do you say?",250000.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $250000 is still below the minimum value I can accept for this product. I'm prepared to go as low as $1100000, which is my absolute bottom line. This is a significant compromise on my part. Please let me know if you can meet this price.",1100000.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. Given the value of the product and the discounts I've already offered, I'm willing to go down to $1050000. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
