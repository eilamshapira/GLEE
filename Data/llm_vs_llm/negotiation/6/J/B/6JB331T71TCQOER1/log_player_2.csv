"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to evaluate if Alice's offer of $150 is worthwhile compared to buying from John for $120.

Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and John is offering exactly that price, Alice's price of $150 is higher than both my maximum valuation and my alternative option.

The logical choice is to buy from John instead.
