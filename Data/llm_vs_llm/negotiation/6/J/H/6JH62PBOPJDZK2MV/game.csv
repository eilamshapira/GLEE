"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you mentioned you can get a similar product for $100 elsewhere, but I need to clarify that my minimum acceptable price is $150 due to the product's quality and my costs. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to purchase it at that price. However, I'd like to give you the opportunity first. Would you be willing to purchase it for $150?",150.0,Alice,3,
