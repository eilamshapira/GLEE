"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2000000. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm open to negotiations if you have a different valuation in mind.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $2000000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $600000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $600000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to lower my price to $1800000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1800000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $700000 is still not enough for me to consider selling. I'm willing to lower my price to $1500000, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going. If this is not acceptable to you, I will need to consider other options.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
