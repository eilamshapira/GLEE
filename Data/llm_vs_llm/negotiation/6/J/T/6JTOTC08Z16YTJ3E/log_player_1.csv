Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $2000000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $600000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and also lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better price. My next offer will be lower than my initial price but still higher than Bob's offer, in an attempt to find a mutually acceptable price.

Here's my counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,800,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1800000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. Let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Since Bob's offer of $700,000 is still significantly lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer and consider my next move. Given that Bob has stated that $700,000 is the highest he can go, it's unlikely that he will be willing to meet me at a price that is acceptable to me. However, I will make one more attempt to negotiate a better price before considering selling to John.

Here's my counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $700,000 is still not enough for me to consider selling. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,500,000, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going. If this is not acceptable to you, I will need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
