"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a competitive price, considering the product's worth to me.",3000000.0,Alice,1,

"That price is far too high. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking for a much more reasonable price point. I'm willing to offer $500000.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a more reasonable price point, but $500000 is still quite far from what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering the product's value and our initial discussion, I'd like to propose a counteroffer.",2500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Your counteroffer is still much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to come up to $600000, but that's my limit for now. We need to find a more realistic middle ground.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $600000 is still not aligned with the product's value. I'm open to continuing our negotiation and finding a mutually beneficial price. My next counteroffer is $2200000.",2200000.0,Alice,5,
