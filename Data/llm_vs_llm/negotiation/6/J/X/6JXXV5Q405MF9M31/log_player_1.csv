"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a competitive price, considering the product's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That price is far too high. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking for a much more reasonable price point. I'm willing to offer $500000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $500,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me, and I believe I can get a better price. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is an option I'd consider if negotiations with Bob don't improve, but for now, I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a more reasonable price point, but $500,000 is still quite far from what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Considering the product's value and our initial discussion, I'd like to propose a counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your counteroffer is still much higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to come up to $600000, but that's my limit for now. We need to find a more realistic middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $600,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe the product is worth more. I'll make another counteroffer to try and bridge the gap between our prices. Since Bob mentioned $600,000 as his limit ""for now,"" I sense there might be some flexibility, and I'd like to test that. Selling to John for $1,500,000 remains an option if negotiations don't progress satisfactorily. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. {""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $600,000 is still not aligned with the product's value. I'm open to continuing our negotiation and finding a mutually beneficial price. My next counteroffer is $2,200,000."", ""product_price"": 2200000}"
