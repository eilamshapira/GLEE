"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to my initial price given the product's value. I can come down to $1130000, which I believe is still a good value for you while being fair to me. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and would allow both of us to benefit from this transaction.",1130000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1130000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we settle at $1110000? This is a fair compromise and would allow me to proceed with the purchase while still respecting your need to stay close to your initial price.",1110000.0,Bob,4,
