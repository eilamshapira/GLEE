"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $12000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. The product is worth about $8000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's offering it at exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $7000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $9000. That gives you a better deal than John's offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9000 is still more than I can justify paying when John is offering the same product for $8000. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead of John, I'd need a better price. I'm willing to pay $7500 - that would save me some money compared to John's offer and still give you a sale. Does that work for you?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8500. This gives you a good deal compared to John's offer and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal.",8500.0,Alice,5,
