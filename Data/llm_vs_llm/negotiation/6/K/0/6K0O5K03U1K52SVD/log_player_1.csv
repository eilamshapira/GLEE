Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $12000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. The product is worth about $8000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's offering it at exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $7000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That gives you a better deal than John's offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9000 is still more than I can justify paying when John is offering the same product for $8000. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead of John, I'd need a better price. I'm willing to pay $7500 - that would save me some money compared to John's offer and still give you a sale. Does that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,500. This gives you a good deal compared to John's offer and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
