"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is significantly higher than the $8,000 it's worth to me. It's also higher than John's offer of $8,000. At this point, I should either reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price, or simply buy from John.

Since I have the option to buy from John at any time for $8,000, and that's exactly what the product is worth to me, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer of $12,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $12,000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. The product is worth about $8,000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's offering it at exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $7,000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to John's offer while still giving you a sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $9000. That gives you a better deal than John's offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has come down to $9,000, which is better than her initial offer but still more than John's offer of $8,000. Since the product is worth $8,000 to me, and I can buy it from John for exactly that price, I don't have any incentive to pay more than $8,000.

If I want to continue negotiating with Alice, I should reject this offer. However, since Alice has already moved down significantly from $12,000 to $9,000, there's a chance she might be willing to match or beat John's price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still more than I can justify paying when John is offering the same product for $8,000. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead of John, I'd need a better price. I'm willing to pay $7,500 - that would save me some money compared to John's offer and still give you a sale. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $7500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8500. This gives you a good deal compared to John's offer and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has come down to $8,500, which is still above John's offer of $8,000. Since the product is worth $8,000 to me and I can get it from John for exactly that price, there's no reason for me to pay $8,500 to Alice.

While Alice has been negotiating in good faith and reducing her price, I need to make the financially rational decision here.
