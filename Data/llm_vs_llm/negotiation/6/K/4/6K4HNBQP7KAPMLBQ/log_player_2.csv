"Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to analyze this situation:
- The product is worth no more than $80 to me
- Alice is offering to sell it for $250, which is far above my maximum value
- John is offering to sell the same product for $80

Since Alice's price of $250 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's alternative price ($80), it makes no sense to accept this offer or even continue negotiating when I have a guaranteed option at my maximum price point.
