Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. Bob values the product at $15,000, and I have a guaranteed fallback offer of $10,000 from John. To maximize my profit while keeping a reasonable chance of Bob accepting, I should price it below Bob's valuation but well above my minimum.

I'll offer it at $13,500, which:
1. Gives Bob $1,500 in value ($15,000 - $13,500)
2. Gives me $3,500 more than my fallback option ($13,500 - $10,000)
3. Splits the surplus relatively fairly while leaving me with the larger share
