"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $8,200
2. John's price: $8,000
3. My maximum value for the product: $8,000

Since Alice's offer ($8,200) is higher than both:
- The price I can get from John ($8,000)
- The maximum value the product is worth to me ($8,000)

The logical choice is to buy from John, as it saves me $200 compared to Alice's offer and matches my maximum valuation.
