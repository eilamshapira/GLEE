Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a good offer to Bob that he will accept, considering the product is worth $120 to him, but $80 to me. If I price it too high, he might counter with a lower offer. If I price it too low, I'm leaving money on the table.

Since I have the option to sell to John for $80 at any time, I'll aim for a price that gives Bob a small discount from the full $120 value but still gives me a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll adjust my pricing strategy slightly. Since Bob counter-offered at $95, I'll try to meet closer to the middle but still maintain good profit.
