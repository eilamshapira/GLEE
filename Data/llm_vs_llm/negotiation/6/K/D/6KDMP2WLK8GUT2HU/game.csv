"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it for $150. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for this product. I know the market value is around $100, and I can actually get it from another seller at that price. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation. Would you consider selling it for $85? This would give us both a fair deal - you'd make a sale, and I'd save some money compared to other options.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept $85 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I understand your point about the market value, but I can assure you of the product's quality. I can lower my price to $120, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would this work for you?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price to $120. However, I need to be transparent - I can get this product from another seller for $100, and that's really the maximum I'm willing to pay. To make it worth both our time, I can offer $95, which would give you a quick sale and save me a bit compared to my other option. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
