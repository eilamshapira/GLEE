Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for this product. I know the market value is around $100, and I can actually get it from another seller at that price. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation. Would you consider selling it for $85? This would give us both a fair deal - you'd make a sale, and I'd save some money compared to other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. I know I can get $100 from John, so accepting $85 would be a loss for me. I'll try to negotiate with Bob for a better price.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept $85 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I understand your point about the market value, but I can assure you of the product's quality. I can lower my price to $120, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 120}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price to $120. However, I need to be transparent - I can get this product from another seller for $100, and that's really the maximum I'm willing to pay. To make it worth both our time, I can offer $95, which would give you a quick sale and save me a bit compared to my other option. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob is not willing to pay more than $100, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $100, it makes the most financial sense to sell to John. There's no reason to accept $95 when I can get $100, and continuing negotiations seems unlikely to yield a better result since Bob has clearly stated his maximum price is $100."
