"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it for $150. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Explanation: Since the product is worth $100 to me and John is willing to sell it for $100, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $150, which is significantly higher. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer. If negotiations with Alice don't work out, I can always buy from John at $100."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for this product. I know the market value is around $100, and I can actually get it from another seller at that price. However, I'd like to continue our negotiation. Would you consider selling it for $85? This would give us both a fair deal - you'd make a sale, and I'd save some money compared to other options."", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept $85 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I understand your point about the market value, but I can assure you of the product's quality. I can lower my price to $120, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Explanation: While Alice has reduced her price from $150 to $120, it's still above the $100 price that John is offering. Since the product is worth $100 to me, paying $120 would mean losing money. I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer. If Alice doesn't come down to a price below $100, I can still buy from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price to $120. However, I need to be transparent - I can get this product from another seller for $100, and that's really the maximum I'm willing to pay. To make it worth both our time, I can offer $95, which would give you a quick sale and save me a bit compared to my other option. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}"
