"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $12500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth, and it would be a profitable investment for you. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $12,500 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you could get a better price from Alice.  You're willing to walk away and buy from John, so you have some leverage."
