"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you will love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'll analyze this offer:

Alice is offering the product for $100, which is $20 less than my alternative option of buying from John at $120.

Since $100 is also below my maximum value for the product ($120), this is actually a good deal for me. While I could try to negotiate for an even lower price, there's a risk of prolonging the negotiation without much benefit.
