"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The rational choice here is to buy from John for $8,000 because:
1. Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than my maximum valuation of $8,000
2. Even if I make a counteroffer, Alice's initial high price of $15,000 suggests she might not be willing to go as low as $8,000
3. John's guaranteed price of $8,000 matches my maximum valuation
4. There's no reason to continue negotiating when I have a guaranteed option at my maximum acceptable price"
