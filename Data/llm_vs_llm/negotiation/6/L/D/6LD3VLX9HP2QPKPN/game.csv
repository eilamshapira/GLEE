"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand budget constraints can be a concern. However, I need to consider the value of the product. I can come down to $10500, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price still reflects the quality and value you'll be getting from this product. Would this work for you?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",10000.0,Bob,4,
