"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",97.5,Bob,4,
