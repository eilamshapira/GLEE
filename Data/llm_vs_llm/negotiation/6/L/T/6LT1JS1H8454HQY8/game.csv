"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's quite a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. I am willing to pay $600000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $600000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $1400000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1400000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. I understand the value of the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I can offer $700000.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. My absolute lowest price is $1300000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects the lowest I can go while still making it worthwhile for me. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
