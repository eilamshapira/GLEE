"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's quite a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. I am interested in the product, but I think a more reasonable price would be $8000. Would you be willing to sell at that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $8000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $15000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but $15000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's try to find a more middle ground. How about $10000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations here. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but not to $10000.  Would you consider $13000? This is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
