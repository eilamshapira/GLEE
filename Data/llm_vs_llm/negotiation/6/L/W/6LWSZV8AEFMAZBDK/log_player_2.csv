"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product for $20000. I believe it has incredible value, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase. Let's discuss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $20,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($15,000) and John's price ($15,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. While I could make a counteroffer, I already know that I can get the product from John for $15,000, which is equal to my maximum value. Since Alice's initial offer is significantly above my maximum value, and negotiations might not reach a better price than John's, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
