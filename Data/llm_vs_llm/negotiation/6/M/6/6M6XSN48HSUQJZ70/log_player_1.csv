"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Considering its unique qualities and value, I'm offering it to you for $2,500,000. This is a rare chance, and I believe this price reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 2500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Considering Bob's counteroffer and the potential for further negotiation, but also keeping in mind my minimum price of $1,500,000 and the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, I will **RejectOffer** and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob, aiming to move closer to my desired price while still being competitive:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe we can find a better price. Given the product's value and the limited availability, I'm willing to lower the price to $2,200,000. This represents a significant opportunity. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1250000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Given Bob's consistent undervaluation of the product and my own minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's time to consider other options. I'm also getting closer to the deadline. I'll **SellToJhon**.

```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
