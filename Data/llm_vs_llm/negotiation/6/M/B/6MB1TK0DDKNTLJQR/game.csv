"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1450000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1100000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $1100000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise and meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I hope this revised price is more suitable for you.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1275000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we settle at $1150000? I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. Considering your offer and my initial price, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm prepared to sell the product to you for $1225000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. I hope this is acceptable to you.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
