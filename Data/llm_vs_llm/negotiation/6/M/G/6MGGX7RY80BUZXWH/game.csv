"Hello Bob, I have a product here that I think you'll find quite valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
That's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know what you think.,80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $80 is lower than I'm willing to go. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure about that price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your hesitation, Bob. $100 is a bit too low for me. This product is truly valuable. How about $120? That's the lowest I'm willing to go right now.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $120 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Okay Bob, I hear you. Let's try this - $115. That's as low as I can possibly go. It's a steal at that price!",115.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $110.  It's fair for both of us.  What do you say?",110.0,Bob,8,
