"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I have a premium product that I believe you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $2000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Reasoning: Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000). Since I can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, which is exactly at my maximum value threshold, it makes no sense to continue negotiating with Alice when her initial offer is double that amount. Even if we negotiate, it's unlikely Alice would drop her price by 50% to match John's price. Therefore, the most rational decision is to buy from John."
