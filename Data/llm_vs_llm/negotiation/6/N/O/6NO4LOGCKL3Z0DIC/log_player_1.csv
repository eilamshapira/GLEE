Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at $19,000 aims for a price significantly higher than your minimum but potentially appealing to Bob if he values the product more than the apparent market value ($10,000).
* **Room for Negotiation:** This high price leaves room for Bob to negotiate down. You can always lower your price slightly if he initially rejects the offer, aiming to settle somewhere above your $15,000 baseline."
