"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that you think the price is a bit high, but I believe the product is worth more than $60. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. How about we meet in the middle?",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $95. It's a great product, and I think it's worth it. I'm trying to be flexible, but I also need to ensure I get a fair price. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to continue negotiating.",95.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're having trouble finding a price that works for both of us.  To be honest, anything above $80 just isn't going to work for me.  That's my absolute best offer.  What do you say?",80.0,Bob,6,
