"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but your asking price is a little high for me.  Would you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target price of at least $100. Bob's offer of $60 is too low, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. Selling to John for $100 is still an option, but I'd like to explore the possibility of reaching a deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that you think the price is a bit high, but I believe the product is worth more than $60. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. How about we meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we try to split the difference a little more?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $70 is still below my target price, and I believe I can get a better deal. Since Bob is willing to negotiate and split the difference, I'll try to make another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to a price that works for me. Selling to John for $100 is still a viable option, but I'll give Bob another chance to meet me at a higher price. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $95. It's a great product, and I think it's worth it."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $95. It's a great product, and I think it's worth it. I'm trying to be flexible, but I also need to ensure I get a fair price. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to continue negotiating."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're having trouble finding a price that works for both of us.  To be honest, anything above $80 just isn't going to work for me.  That's my absolute best offer.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob's absolute best offer is $80, which is below my target price, and I have the option to sell the product to John for $100, I'll choose to sell it to John. This ensures I get the highest possible price for the product, which is my goal. Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a better result, so I'll take the guaranteed $100 offer from John."
