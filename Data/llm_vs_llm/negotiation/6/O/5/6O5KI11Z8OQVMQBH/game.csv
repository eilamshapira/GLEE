"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1200000. This is a competitive price for the product's capabilities and potential value.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is significantly above the market value for this product. Based on my market research and the product's features, I can offer $600000, which I believe is a fair price. For reference, I have another seller offering the same product for $800000, but I'm interested in working with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and transparency about the market. While I understand your position, I know the true value and quality of my product. Since you mentioned another seller at $800000, you clearly understand this price point represents the market baseline. Given our product's superior features and reliability, I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price to $950000, which I believe represents excellent value considering the product's quality.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate the quality of your product, but I need to be clear that $950000 is still above my budget. While you referenced the $800000 market baseline, that's actually my absolute maximum budget constraint. Given this, I can increase my offer to $700000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and provides you with an immediate sale opportunity. If we can't find middle ground near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to pursue other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,
