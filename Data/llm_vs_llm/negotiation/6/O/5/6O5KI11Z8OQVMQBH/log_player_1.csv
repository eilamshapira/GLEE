Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,200,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is significantly above the market value for this product. Based on my market research and the product's features, I can offer $600000, which I believe is a fair price. For reference, I have another seller offering the same product for $800000, but I'm interested in working with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll follow up with a counteroffer. Bob mentioned another seller at $800,000, which matches John's price. This confirms the market value and strengthens my position. However, since Bob is interested in working with me specifically, there's room for negotiation above the $800,000 mark.

My next counteroffer will be lower than my initial price but still comfortably above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and transparency about the market. While I understand your position, I know the true value and quality of my product. Since you mentioned another seller at $800,000, you clearly understand this price point represents the market baseline. Given our product's superior features and reliability, I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price to $950,000, which I believe represents excellent value considering the product's quality."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate the quality of your product, but I need to be clear that $950000 is still above my budget. While you referenced the $800000 market baseline, that's actually my absolute maximum budget constraint. Given this, I can increase my offer to $700000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and provides you with an immediate sale opportunity. If we can't find middle ground near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to pursue other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob has made it clear that $800,000 is his absolute maximum budget, and his current offer of $700,000 is still significantly below that. Since he's indicated he won't go much higher than his current offer, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $800,000, it makes the most business sense to sell to John. This ensures I get my minimum acceptable price without further negotiation rounds and the risk of Bob walking away."
