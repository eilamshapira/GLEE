"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1200000. This is a competitive price for the product's capabilities and potential value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly above my maximum value
3. I can buy the same product from John for $800,000
4. While I could make a counteroffer, Alice's initial offer is so high that it suggests she values the product much higher than I do

I will reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Even though I could buy from John immediately, I'll try negotiating with Alice first to potentially get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's below my maximum value but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,200,000 is significantly above the market value for this product. Based on my market research and the product's features, I can offer $600,000, which I believe is a fair price. For reference, I have another seller offering the same product for $800,000, but I'm interested in working with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and transparency about the market. While I understand your position, I know the true value and quality of my product. Since you mentioned another seller at $800000, you clearly understand this price point represents the market baseline. Given our product's superior features and reliability, I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price to $950000, which I believe represents excellent value considering the product's quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that:
1. Alice has reduced her price from $1,200,000 to $950,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. However, $950,000 is still significantly above both:
   - My maximum value ($800,000)
   - John's guaranteed offer ($800,000)
3. Alice seems to be anchoring her price above John's offer, suggesting she might not be willing to go below $800,000
4. We still have several rounds available for negotiation, but Alice's high counter suggests a large gap in our valuations

Since Alice's price is still above my maximum value and above John's offer, and her messaging suggests she values the product significantly higher than $800,000, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still maintain a price below John's offer to see if we can meet at a mutually beneficial price point.

{""message"": ""Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate the quality of your product, but I need to be clear that $950,000 is still above my budget. While you referenced the $800,000 market baseline, that's actually my absolute maximum budget constraint. Given this, I can increase my offer to $700,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and provides you with an immediate sale opportunity. If we can't find middle ground near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to pursue other options."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
