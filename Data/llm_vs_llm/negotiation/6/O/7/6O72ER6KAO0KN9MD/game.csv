"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I highly value. Given its special qualities, I'm initially proposing a price of $1500000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to inform you that I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $1200000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a more competitive price. My budget constraints and market research suggest a fair value would be around $950000. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your position. While I'm aiming higher than that, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we settle at $1250000? This reflects the true value of this product, which I believe you'll find worthwhile.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I should mention that John's offer stands at $1200000, which aligns with my maximum budget for this product. To make it worth choosing you over John, I would need a better price. I can offer you $1100000, which would be a fair deal for both of us and would allow me to purchase from you instead of John. Does this work for you?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  Would you consider $1175000? This is a very competitive price, considering John's offer doesn't include the benefits of working with me directly.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
