Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to inform you that I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $1200000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a more competitive price. My budget constraints and market research suggest a fair value would be around $950000. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I should mention that John's offer stands at $1200000, which aligns with my maximum budget for this product. To make it worth choosing you over John, I would need a better price. I can offer you $1100000, which would be a fair deal for both of us and would allow me to purchase from you instead of John. Does this work for you?
