"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's offer of $95 is higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80), it wouldn't be rational to accept it. Between options 2 and 3, while I could try negotiating with Alice by making a counteroffer, there's no guarantee she would go below $80 since that's her cost. John's offering a price that matches my maximum value, so that's a safe option.
