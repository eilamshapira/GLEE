"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you today. I believe it's a valuable item that would serve you well. I'm offering it for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's initial offer is $120, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I don't see any benefit in accepting the offer immediately. I'd like to try to negotiate a better price. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial offer. Since I don't know the value of the product to Alice, I'll make a reasonable offer to test the waters.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, I think the product is worth more than $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's counteroffer of $105 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Since we're negotiating, I'd like to try to bring the price down further. I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to meet Alice halfway between my previous offer of $90 and her counteroffer of $105. That would put us at $97.50. I'll make a counteroffer slightly below that to see if Alice is willing to budge.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 95}"
