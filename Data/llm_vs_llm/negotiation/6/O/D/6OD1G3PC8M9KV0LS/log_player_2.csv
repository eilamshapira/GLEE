"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'm looking for $14000, which I think is a fair value considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll analyze this situation:

- Alice is offering the product for $14,000
- The product is worth up to $15,000 to me
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $15,000
- My goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible

Alice's offer is $1,000 less than John's price. Since my goal is to save money and Alice's price is below my maximum valuation, accepting Alice's offer is the rational choice.
