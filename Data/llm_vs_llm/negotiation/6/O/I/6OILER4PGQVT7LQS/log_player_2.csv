"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity.  I believe this product holds immense value for you, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your business.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This price reflects the value I know you'll derive from it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than John's price of $1,500,000, it's still significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of $800,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal to Alice that I'm looking for a better price and increase the chances of getting a more favorable deal."
