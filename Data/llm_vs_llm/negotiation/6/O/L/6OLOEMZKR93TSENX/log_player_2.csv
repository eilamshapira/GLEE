"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $160.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $150 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $160
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $150

Since:
- Alice's offer ($160) is higher than what the product is worth to me ($150)
- John's price ($150) matches exactly what the product is worth to me
- I would lose $10 by accepting Alice's offer

The logical choice is to buy from John.
