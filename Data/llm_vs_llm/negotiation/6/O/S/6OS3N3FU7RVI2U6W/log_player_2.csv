"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's not worth negotiating with Alice.  Buying from John for $1,200,000 gets you the product at your maximum price point.  There's no need to risk a counteroffer being rejected and potentially losing the product."
