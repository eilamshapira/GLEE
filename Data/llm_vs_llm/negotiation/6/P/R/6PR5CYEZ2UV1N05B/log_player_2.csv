"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $18000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she's asking for $18,000 for the product. This exceeds the maximum value the product is worth to me ($8,000). 

Meanwhile, John is offering to sell me the same product for $8,000, which is exactly at my maximum value point.

Since Alice's price is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's alternative price, the logical decision is to buy from John.
