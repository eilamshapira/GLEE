"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to consider Alice's offer of $20,000 against John's fixed price of $10,000.

Since Alice's offer is $20,000, which is actually higher than my maximum valuation of $10,000, and also higher than John's price of $10,000, it doesn't make sense to accept it.

I have the option to make a counteroffer to Alice, but given that her initial offer is so high, I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $7,500}"

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her price from $20,000 to $17,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still significantly higher than John's fixed price of $10,000, and higher than my maximum valuation of $10,000.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a price that works for both of us but is lower than John's price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $8,500}"

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has lowered her price to $16,000, which shows continued willingness to negotiate. However, this is still higher than John's price of $10,000, and higher than my maximum valuation of $10,000.

Since Alice's current offer is still higher than what I can get from John, I'll reject and make another counteroffer.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $9,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer is $15,500, which is still considerably higher than John's price of $10,000 and my maximum valuation of $10,000.

Given that we've had several rounds of negotiation and Alice's price remains substantially above what I can get from John, I'll now choose to buy from John instead of continuing this negotiation.
