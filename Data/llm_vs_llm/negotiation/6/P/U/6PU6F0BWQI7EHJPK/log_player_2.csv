"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","The offer from Alice is $200, which is higher than the $150 limit that the product is worth to me. It also exceeds John's price of $150. 

Since I can buy the product from John for $150, which matches my maximum value for the product, there's no reason to accept Alice's higher offer of $200.

I could try to negotiate with Alice by rejecting and making a counteroffer, but since I already have a guaranteed option at my maximum acceptable price, the most logical decision is to buy from John.
