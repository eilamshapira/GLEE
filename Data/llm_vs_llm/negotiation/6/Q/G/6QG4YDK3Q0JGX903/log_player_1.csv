Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer that leaves room for negotiation while starting high.

{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly higher than John's fixed offer of $800,000 and represents a good value above my minimum threshold, I'll accept this offer.
