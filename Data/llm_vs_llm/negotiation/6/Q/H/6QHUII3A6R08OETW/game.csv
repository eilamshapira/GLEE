"That's a bit steep for me, Alice. I'm interested, but my budget is significantly lower. How about $5000?",5000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price. While $5000 is far too low for this product, I'm willing to come down from my original offer. Considering its rarity and value, the lowest I can go is $20000.",20000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $20000 is still outside my range. I'm capped at $10000 total, including any potential negotiation. I can offer you $7000 right now.",7000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I'm sorry, but $7000 is still significantly below the product's worth to me, and I can't accept that. However, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle ground. How about $17000? That's my absolute final offer.",17000.0,Alice,5,,
