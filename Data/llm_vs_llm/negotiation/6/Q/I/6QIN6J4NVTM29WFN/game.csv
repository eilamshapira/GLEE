"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow me to make the most of the purchase. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $9500 as this is below my minimum acceptable price. Given the product's value and quality, I can offer it to you for $11000, which represents a $500 reduction from my initial offer. This price still provides you with good value while being fair to both parties. Would you consider this revised offer?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for the revised price of $11000. I appreciate the $500 reduction, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to propose a compromise at $10200. This price is closer to my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair middle ground for both of us. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?",10200.0,Bob,4,
