Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow me to make the most of the purchase. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since Bob's offer of $9,500 is below even my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and I can get $10,000 from John. However, since Bob values the product at $12,000, there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial price."

This price still provides you with good value while being fair to both parties. Would you consider this revised offer?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for the revised price of $11000. I appreciate the $500 reduction, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to propose a compromise at $10200. This price is closer to my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair middle ground for both of us. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $10,200. This is a reasonable compromise as it's above my minimum price of $10,000 and slightly better than John's guaranteed offer. While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, and this price already gives me a fair profit."
