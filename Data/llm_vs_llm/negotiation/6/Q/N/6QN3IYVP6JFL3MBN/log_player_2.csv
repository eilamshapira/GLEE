"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product available that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm offering it to you for $145. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $100
2. Alice is offering the product for $145
3. John is willing to sell it for $100

Since Alice's offer ($145) is higher than my maximum value ($100), and John's price ($100) matches my maximum value, the logical choice is to buy from John.
