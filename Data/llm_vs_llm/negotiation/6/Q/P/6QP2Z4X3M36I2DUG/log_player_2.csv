Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you. Let's meet in the middle a little more. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2300000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to see you benefit from this product.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product has value, but so does my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000, but that's really as high as I can go.  It's a fair offer considering John's offer."",

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
``` 

I'm matching John's offer to signal I'm serious about walking away. This puts the pressure on Alice while not exceeding my budget.  It's a strong negotiating position."
