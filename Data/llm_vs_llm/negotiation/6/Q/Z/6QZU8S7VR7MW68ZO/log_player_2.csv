"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Based on the information provided, Alice is offering the product for $180, which is significantly higher than the $80 that the product is worth to me (Bob). John is offering the same product for exactly $80, which matches the maximum I'm willing to pay.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, the best decision would be to buy from John for $80 rather than accept Alice's much higher offer of $180.
