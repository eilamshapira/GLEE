"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than John's price of $800,000 and above my maximum value. It would be wise to reject this offer and make a counteroffer that's more reasonable. If we can't reach an agreement with Alice at a better price, we can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 600000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $600,000, which is below John's price of $800,000. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to John's offer. If Alice counters with a reasonable price between $600,000 and $800,000, we could reach a mutually beneficial agreement. If not, we still have John's offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has lowered her price from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but it's still significantly higher than John's price of $800,000. Since we still have several rounds left for negotiation and Alice has shown flexibility in her pricing, it makes sense to continue negotiating by making another counteroffer. If we can't get closer to or below John's price, we can always take John's offer later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 700000}

I'll increase my previous offer to $700,000. This is still below John's price of $800,000 but shows that I'm willing to move up from my initial offer of $600,000. Since Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing her price by $200,000, I'm responding by increasing my offer by $100,000. This keeps us in a negotiating position while still maintaining the potential to save money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice continues to lower her price, now down to $900,000, but it's still above John's price of $800,000. Since Alice has shown consistent willingness to reduce her price (from $1.2M → $1M → $900K), it's worth making one more counteroffer. We might be able to get her to meet or beat John's price. If not, we still have John's offer as a reliable backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 750000}

I'll increase my offer to $750,000. This demonstrates continued good faith in the negotiation by moving closer to Alice's price, while still staying below John's price of $800,000. Alice has been consistently lowering her price throughout the negotiation, so offering $750,000 might lead to an agreement that saves us money compared to John's offer. If Alice doesn't accept this or counter with a price at or below $800,000, we can still take John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's best to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($850,000) is still above John's price ($800,000)
2. While Alice has been gradually lowering her price, the rate of decrease is slowing down
3. Even if we continue negotiating, it's unlikely Alice will go below John's price of $800,000
4. We've already spent several rounds negotiating, and the best offer is still above our alternative

It's time to exercise our option with John and secure the product for $800,000, which is the better deal."
