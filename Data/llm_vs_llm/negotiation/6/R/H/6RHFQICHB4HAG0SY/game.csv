"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be very valuable for you. Given its high quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1100000. This price reflects the product's true worth while still leaving room for you to profit from the investment. Would you be interested in proceeding with this offer?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe the product could be a great fit for me at a lower price point. I'm willing to offer $900000 for it. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must respectfully decline. Given the product's quality and market value, I believe $900000 is too low. I can come down from my initial price to $1000000, which I think is a fair compromise and would still provide you with significant value given the product's potential. Would you consider this revised offer?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your revised offer. I understand your position, but I still think there's room for negotiation. How about we settle at $950000? This would be a good middle ground and still reflects the value of the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
