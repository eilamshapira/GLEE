"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be very valuable for you. Given its high quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. This price reflects the product's true worth while still leaving room for you to profit from the investment. Would you be interested in proceeding with this offer?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe the product could be a great fit for me at a lower price point. I'm willing to offer $900000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. While $900,000 is above my minimum threshold, there's still significant room for negotiation considering the product's value to Bob ($1.2M). I'll continue negotiating to try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must respectfully decline. Given the product's quality and market value, I believe $900,000 is too low. I can come down from my initial price to $1,000,000, which I think is a fair compromise and would still provide you with significant value given the product's potential. Would you consider this revised offer?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your revised offer. I understand your position, but I still think there's room for negotiation. How about we settle at $950000? This would be a good middle ground and still reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $950,000. This is a reasonable compromise that provides good value for both parties. While it's less than my initial ask, it's significantly better than my alternative option of selling to John for $800,000, and we've reached a fair middle ground. The risk of pushing further might lead to a breakdown in negotiations, and $950,000 represents a good return."
