"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer ($75) is below my minimum acceptable price ($80) and even below John's guaranteed offer ($80), it would not be rational to accept it. Given that I have John's guaranteed offer of $80, there's no reason to accept anything less than that.

However, since I still have 8 rounds left for negotiation, I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, as there's potential to get a better price than John's $80.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial price but still maintain a price well above my minimum to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob has offered $85, which is above both my minimum price ($80) and John's guaranteed offer ($80). While I could try to negotiate for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob might withdraw or lower his offer in future rounds. Since this is a reasonable profit margin, I'll accept this offer.
