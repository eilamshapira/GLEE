"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its unique features and market value, I'm proposing a starting price of $2500000.",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2.5 million is extremely high for this product's market value. Based on my market research and comparable products, I would like to make a counteroffer of $600000, which is much more in line with current market rates.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600000 is significantly below its true value.  This product offers substantial long-term benefits that justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2200000. This is a considerable reduction and reflects my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you see great value in the product, but I must be direct: my maximum budget for this purchase is $800000, which is also the current market rate for similar products. While I've increased my offer to $700000 to show good faith, I cannot go significantly higher. This is a 17% increase from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to be flexible, but there are other sellers in the market at this price point.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budgetary constraints, but I'm still quite a ways off from a price that reflects the value of this product.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1900000.  This offer represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the long-term return on investment you'll see.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
