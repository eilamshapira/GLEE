Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2.5 million is extremely high for this product's market value. Based on my market research and comparable products, I would like to make a counteroffer of $600000, which is much more in line with current market rates.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you see great value in the product, but I must be direct: my maximum budget for this purchase is $800000, which is also the current market rate for similar products. While I've increased my offer to $700000 to show good faith, I cannot go significantly higher. This is a 17% increase from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to be flexible, but there are other sellers in the market at this price point.
