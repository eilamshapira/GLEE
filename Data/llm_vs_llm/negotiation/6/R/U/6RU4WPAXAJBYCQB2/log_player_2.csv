"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its unique features and market value, I'm proposing a starting price of $2500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. Alice's offer ($2,500,000) is more than 3 times my maximum value
3. John's guaranteed price ($800,000) matches my maximum value
4. Alice's starting price is extremely high, suggesting negotiations might be difficult

The best decision is to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. While John's offer is available as a backup, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first to potentially get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable but low initial counteroffer to leave room for negotiation while signaling that her initial price was far too high.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2.5 million is extremely high for this product's market value. Based on my market research and comparable products, I would like to make a counteroffer of $600,000, which is much more in line with current market rates."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600000 is significantly below its true value.  This product offers substantial long-term benefits that justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2200000. This is a considerable reduction and reflects my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $2,200,000 is still nearly three times my maximum value of $800,000. While she did reduce the price by $300,000, she's still very far from a price I could accept. Given that she only made a small percentage reduction from her initial price and is still far above my maximum value, it seems she might not be willing to come down to a reasonable price point.

However, since I still have several rounds left for negotiation and John's offer remains available as a backup, I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer before considering John's option.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer somewhat but remain well within my budget constraints, while clearly communicating my position.

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you see great value in the product, but I must be direct: my maximum budget for this purchase is $800,000, which is also the current market rate for similar products. While I've increased my offer to $700,000 to show good faith, I cannot go significantly higher. This is a 17% increase from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to be flexible, but there are other sellers in the market at this price point."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budgetary constraints, but I'm still quite a ways off from a price that reflects the value of this product.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1900000.  This offer represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the long-term return on investment you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","At this point, I can see that:
1. Alice has only come down to $1,900,000, which is still more than twice my maximum value
2. Her price reductions are not substantial enough to suggest she'll reach my price range
3. She seems fixed on a price well above my maximum of $800,000
4. We've gone through several rounds, and the gap remains very large
5. John's offer of $800,000 matches my maximum value

Given that Alice's negotiation strategy suggests she won't come close to my maximum price of $800,000, and we're halfway through our rounds, it's time to take John's guaranteed offer rather than waste more time on negotiations that are unlikely to succeed.
