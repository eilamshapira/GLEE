"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $11,500
2. John's price: $12,000
3. My maximum value: $12,000

Since Alice's offer ($11,500) is:
- Below my maximum value ($12,000)
- Better than John's price ($12,000)
- Saves me $500 compared to buying from John
