"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe will meet your needs perfectly. Considering its value and quality, I am offering it to you at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given the information provided, let me analyze the situation:

- You're looking for a product worth no more than $10,000 to you
- Alice is offering to sell it for $20,000
- John is willing to sell the same product for $10,000

Since Alice's offer ($20,000) is significantly higher than both:
1. The maximum value of the product to you ($10,000)
2. John's offer price ($10,000)

The logical choice is to buy from John instead of accepting Alice's offer.
