"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **High initial anchor:** I'm starting with a price significantly above my minimum ($800,000). This sets a high anchor for the negotiation.
*   **Exploring Bob's willingness to pay:** I want to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. A high initial price helps me understand his upper limit.
*   **Room for negotiation:** This price leaves plenty of room for me to come down in future rounds if needed, while still aiming for a substantial profit.
*   **John is my backup plan:** I am okay with the possibility of Bob rejecting. I always have John available to purchase at $800,000."
