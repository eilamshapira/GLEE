"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for both of us. Would you consider a significantly lower price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that my initial price was high, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $800000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to meet you halfway and make a serious consideration for your business. Here's a revised offer that I think is more reasonable.",2200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price, but we're still quite far apart. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, I'm aiming for something closer to the $1000000 mark. Would you be willing to consider an offer in that range?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your honesty about your target price range. I'm willing to continue negotiating and find a mutually beneficial agreement. After considering your offer, I'd like to propose a counteroffer that's closer to your range but still reflects the product's value. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
