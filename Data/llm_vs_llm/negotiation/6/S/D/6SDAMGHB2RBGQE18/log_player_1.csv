Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for both of us. Would you consider a significantly lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $800,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and I believe the product is worth more. I'll try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 

My counteroffer: $2,200,000. This price is lower than my initial offer but still reflects the product's value and gives Bob a better deal than my first offer."

However, $800,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to meet you halfway and make a serious consideration for your business. Here's a revised offer that I think is more reasonable."", ""product_price"": 2200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price, but we're still quite far apart. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, I'm aiming for something closer to the $1000000 mark. Would you be willing to consider an offer in that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob. While $1,100,000 is closer to my target price, I still believe the product is worth more, and I'm not ready to sell it for that amount yet. I'll try to find a compromise that works for both of us.

My counteroffer: $1,400,000. This price is lower than my previous offer and takes into account Bob's target price range, but it's still closer to the product's true value."
