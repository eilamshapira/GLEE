Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 120}

Explanation (not part of response format):
Since I know the product is worth $120 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $120, there's no reason to offer Bob a lower price. Even though Bob values the product at $80, accepting any price below $120 would mean losing money compared to selling to John. Therefore, I'll offer it to Bob at $120 - if he rejects it (which he likely will since it's above his valuation), I can still sell it to John for the same amount."
