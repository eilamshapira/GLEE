"Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice's offer is $130
2. I know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation
3. I have John's offer of $150 as a backup
4. Alice's current offer ($130) is already better than John's ($150)

Since Alice's starting offer is relatively high (considering the product is worth $80 to her), and I want to save as much money as possible, I should try to negotiate for a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $80 to Alice and she offered $130, I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but significantly lower to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 95}

This counteroffer makes sense because:
1. It's above Alice's cost ($80), so she can still make a profit
2. It's significantly below her initial offer of $130, giving room for negotiation
3. It's much better than John's price of $150
4. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate upward while maintaining a good price"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has lowered her price from $130 to $120, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This is still well above her cost ($80)
3. It's significantly better than John's price ($150)
4. We tried $95 and she rejected it
5. There might be a bit more room to negotiate, but we risk Alice getting frustrated

Since Alice has made a meaningful reduction from her initial offer ($10 less), and $120 is a reasonable price (saves $30 compared to John's offer), I'll accept this offer.
