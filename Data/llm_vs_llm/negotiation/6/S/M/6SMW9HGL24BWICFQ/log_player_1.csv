"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, $1450000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm happy to pay $1300000 for it, which still leaves you with a significant profit. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is higher than John's offer of $1,200,000, I still have room to negotiate and try to get a better price. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

My next offer will be:
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,420,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 1,420,000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm interested in the product, $1420000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1350000.  This price is a good compromise, and I believe it's fair for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Since Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still lower than what I'm willing to accept, and higher than John's offer of $1,200,000, I will reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer. I believe I can still negotiate a better price.
