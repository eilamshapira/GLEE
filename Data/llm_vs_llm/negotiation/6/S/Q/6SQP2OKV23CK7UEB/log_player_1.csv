Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer, Alice. I understand that we both have our target prices, but I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have a better alternative with John's offer of $1,500,000, so I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob. 

My next offer will be: 
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is still below my expectations. I'm willing to make a concession and sell the product to you for $1,650,000."", ""product_price"": 1650000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to negotiate. I understand that we both want to find a fair price. I'm willing to raise my offer to $1300000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Although Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's still below the product's value to me and John's offer of $1,500,000. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer, trying to get a better price from Bob.

My next offer will be: 
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to make another concession and sell the product to you for $1,600,000."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
