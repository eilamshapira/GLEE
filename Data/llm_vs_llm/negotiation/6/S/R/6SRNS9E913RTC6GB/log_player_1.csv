Send your offer to Bob.,"Given the situation:
- The product is worth $150 minimum to me
- The product is worth $120 to Bob
- I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150
- Bob can only accept or reject my offer

There's no reason for me to offer the product to Bob for less than $150, since I can get that amount from John. Since Bob values the product at $120, he won't accept any offer of $120 or higher.

Therefore, I'll offer the product at $150, knowing Bob will reject it, and I'll then sell to John.
