Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer Bob for this product. The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at exactly that price. Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I should set a price higher than my minimum acceptable amount.

If I price it too high, Bob might reject it, but I still have John's offer as a safety net. If I price it reasonably above my minimum, there's a chance Bob will accept and I'll make more profit.

I'll offer a price that represents a significant premium over my minimum value:
