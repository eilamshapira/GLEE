"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

Since you are willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product from John, and Alice is offering the same price, there is no advantage to buying from Alice. You can always buy from John as a backup.  Rejecting Alice's offer might give you the opportunity to negotiate a lower price with her."
