"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering you this fantastic product for $120. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I notice that Alice is offering the product at $120, which is below my maximum value of $150. However, I might be able to get a better deal with a counteroffer since the product is only worth $80 to Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $120 seems a bit high for what I'm looking for. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it, which I think is fair given current market prices. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob! How about we meet in the middle? I can offer you the product for $110. I think that's a reasonable price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has reduced her price to $110, which is a better offer than her initial $120. However, since the product is only worth $80 to her, I still have room to negotiate for a better price. The $110 is well below my maximum value of $150 and significantly better than John's price, but I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a better middle ground.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That seems like a fair compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I can see we're getting closer. How about I sell you the product for $105? I think this price reflects its value well while still being a good deal for you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has come down to $105, which is getting closer to my counteroffer of $100. It's a reasonable price that's well below my maximum value of $150 and much better than John's $150 offer. While I could continue negotiating, the difference is becoming smaller, and there's risk in pushing too hard. I'll accept this offer to secure the product at a good price.
