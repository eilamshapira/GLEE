"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe will meet your needs perfectly. I'm offering it to you at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you can buy the same product from John for the same price ($15,000), there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting her offer keeps the option open to potentially negotiate a lower price with her or find a better deal elsewhere."
