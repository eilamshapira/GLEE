(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I should not accept Alice's offer of $20,000 because the product is only worth up to $15,000 to me. Additionally, I have the option to buy from John for $15,000 at any time, so I should never pay more than that. I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

However, this is still above the $15,000 that the product is worth to me, and above John's price. Since I can buy from John for $15,000 at any time, I should continue negotiating with Alice to try to get a better price.

Since I have the option to buy from John for $15,000 at any time, and that's the maximum value the product has to me, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.
