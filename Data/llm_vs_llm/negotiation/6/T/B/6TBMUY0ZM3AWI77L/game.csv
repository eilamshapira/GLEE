"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $180. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product, which is the most I'm comfortable spending. Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $80 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? This feels like a fair compromise.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $130.  Let's split the difference and go with $100. That feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $100 is a tempting offer, I'm still looking to get a bit more for it. How about $115? That's my final offer.",115.0,Alice,5,
