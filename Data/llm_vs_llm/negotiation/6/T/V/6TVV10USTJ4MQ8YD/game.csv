"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product today. Based on the market value and the quality of what I'm offering, I believe a fair price would be $1400000. This represents an excellent opportunity for you, as I understand the product would be worth $1500000 to you, giving you a $100000 gain in value. How does this sound?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price seems a bit high. I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $1100000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be transparent that $1100000 is below what I can accept for this product. I have another buyer ready at $1200000, which is my absolute minimum. However, I'd prefer to work with you. Given the $1500000 value this product offers you, I can come down to $1350000, which still provides you with $150000 in added value. This is significantly better than my initial offer and represents a fair middle ground between our positions.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
