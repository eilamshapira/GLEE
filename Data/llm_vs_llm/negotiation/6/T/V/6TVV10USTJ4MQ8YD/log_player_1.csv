Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be transparent that $1,100,000 is below what I can accept for this product. I have another buyer ready at $1,200,000, which is my absolute minimum. However, I'd prefer to work with you. Given the $1,500,000 value this product offers you, I can come down to $1,350,000, which still provides you with $150,000 in added value. This is significantly better than my initial offer and represents a fair middle ground between our positions."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
