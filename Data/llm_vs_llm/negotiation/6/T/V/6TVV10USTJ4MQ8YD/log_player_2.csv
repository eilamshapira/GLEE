"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product today. Based on the market value and the quality of what I'm offering, I believe a fair price would be $1400000. This represents an excellent opportunity for you, as I understand the product would be worth $1500000 to you, giving you a $100000 gain in value. How does this sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be transparent that $1100000 is below what I can accept for this product. I have another buyer ready at $1200000, which is my absolute minimum. However, I'd prefer to work with you. Given the $1500000 value this product offers you, I can come down to $1350000, which still provides you with $150000 in added value. This is significantly better than my initial offer and represents a fair middle ground between our positions.
