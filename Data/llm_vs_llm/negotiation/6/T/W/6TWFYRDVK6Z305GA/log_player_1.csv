"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **High Initial Price:** I'm starting with a relatively high price of $150. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he values the product. Starting high allows me to potentially capture more profit if he's willing to pay a premium.
*   **Negotiation Room:** This price leaves room for negotiation. I can always lower it in subsequent rounds if needed.
*   **John as Backup:** I always have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not afraid to lose the deal with Bob if he's unwilling to pay a reasonable price. I'm aiming to maximize my profit, so I'm willing to risk losing the sale if Bob's offer is too low.
*   **10 Round Limit:** Knowing I have 10 rounds encourages me to try and extract maximum value early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to accept it immediately. It's only round 2, and I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price. Rejecting the offer now and making a counteroffer allows me to test Bob's willingness to pay more. I always have the option of selling to John later if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Reduced Price:** I've lowered the price from $150 to $140. This demonstrates some willingness to negotiate and shows Bob I'm not completely inflexible.
*   **Still Above Minimum:** The price is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $80.
*   **Information Gathering:** I'm still trying to gauge Bob's valuation. His initial offer of $80 might be a starting point for him as well, or it might be his actual maximum willingness to pay.
*   **Playing the Game:** Remember, it's only round 3. I have time to explore potential prices."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is a slight improvement, I'm still going to reject it. Here's why:

*   **He's Moving Up:** Bob increasing his offer from $80 to $90 indicates that he *might* be willing to go higher. This is valuable information.
*   **Room to Negotiate:** I still have room to come down from $140.
*   **John Still Available:** John's offer of $80 is still a safe fallback.
*   **Goal is Maximum Profit:** I'm trying to maximize my profit, not just make a quick sale at my minimum acceptable price.

I'll reject this and make another counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

Okay, it's Round 5, so I need to start getting more realistic while still aiming for a good profit. Here's my thinking:

*   **Significant Price Reduction:** I've dropped the price considerably from $140 to $125. This should signal to Bob that I'm seriously willing to negotiate.
*   **Still Profitable:** $125 is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $80.
*   **Testing Bob's Limits:** This price point will give me a better indication of how close we are to a deal. If Bob rejects this offer, his counteroffer will be very telling about his true valuation.
*   **Time is a Factor:** With only 5 rounds left after this one, I need to start narrowing the gap quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Incremental Increase:** Bob's offer only increased by $5. This suggests he might be approaching his maximum willingness to pay.
*   **Still Below Target:** $95 is still below what I'd ideally like to get.
*   **One More Try:** I'm going to reject this one more time and see how much I can squeeze out of him. I believe he's interested.
*   **Risk/Reward:** The risk of losing the sale is increasing, but the potential reward of a higher price is still there.

I'll reject and make another counteroffer. This is a crucial round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob closer to the middle. $110 is a significant drop from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about closing the deal.
*   **Still a Good Profit:** $110 is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $80.
*   **Pressure on Bob:** I'm essentially putting the pressure on Bob. If he rejects this offer, it strongly suggests he's not willing to go much higher, and I need to seriously consider my options.
*   **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only 3 rounds left after this one, I need to get closer to a deal, otherwise I will have to sell to John.

I'm hoping this offer will be accepted. If not, the next round will be critical."
