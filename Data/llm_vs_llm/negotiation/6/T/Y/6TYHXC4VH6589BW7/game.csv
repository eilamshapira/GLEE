"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand that my initial offer was beyond your budget, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to negotiate and would like to propose a counteroffer of $2000000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2000000 is still significantly above what I can afford. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $700000, which is the upper limit of my budget for this product. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $700000 is still below the product's value. I'm willing to make a compromise and propose a counteroffer of $1350000. This price takes into account your budget constraints while also reflecting the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
