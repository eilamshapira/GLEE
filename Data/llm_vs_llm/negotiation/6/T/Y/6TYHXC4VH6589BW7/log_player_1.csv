Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but the price you're asking is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $600000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $600,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. My counteroffer will be $2,000,000. This price still reflects the product's value and gives Bob a chance to reconsider his budget. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand that my initial offer was beyond your budget, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to negotiate and would like to propose a counteroffer of $2,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2000000 is still significantly above what I can afford. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $700000, which is the upper limit of my budget for this product. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Since Bob has reached the upper limit of his budget, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my previous counteroffer. My counteroffer will be $1,350,000. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $700,000 is still below the product's value.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1350000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750000 as my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. Please let me know your thoughts.

Since Bob's final offer of $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I have the option to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, I think it's best to accept John's offer. This ensures that I get a price that meets my minimum requirement, and I don't have to continue negotiating with Bob."
