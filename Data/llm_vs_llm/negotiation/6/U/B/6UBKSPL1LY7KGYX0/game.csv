"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer, but $80 is below my minimum price. I can go as low as $130. Let me know if that works for you.",130.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to stick to my minimum price. How about $125? This is the best I can do.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still above what I'm willing to spend. How about we settle at $90? This way, we both get a fair deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still below my minimum. I can offer you the product for $122, which is as low as I can go while still making a reasonable profit. Let me know if this works for you.",122.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. My final offer is $121. This is the lowest I can go while still valuing the product appropriately. Let me know if you can accept this price.",121.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, but $121 is still too high for me. Let's try $95. I think this is a reasonable price and it's closer to what I can afford.",95.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $95 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to go down to $120, which is my absolute bottom line. Let me know if you can accept this offer.",120.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're close to finding a solution. My final offer is $120. This is the lowest I can go while still valuing the product appropriately. Let me know if you can accept this price.",120.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, $120 is still beyond my budget. How about we settle at $100? This is the maximum I can go, and it's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,8,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is below my minimum price. I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $120 for the product. Therefore, I will sell it to him. Thank you for your interest.",,Alice,8,SellToJhon
