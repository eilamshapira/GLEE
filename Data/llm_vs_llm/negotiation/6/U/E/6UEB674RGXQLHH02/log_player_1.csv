(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer is equal to John's offer and equal to my minimum acceptable price, there's no advantage in accepting it right now. I believe I can get a better price from Bob through negotiation.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
