"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $135. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows you both to benefit from the transaction. If you accept, you'll get something worth $150 to you at a lower cost, giving you $15 in value. What do you say?",135.0,Alice,1,
