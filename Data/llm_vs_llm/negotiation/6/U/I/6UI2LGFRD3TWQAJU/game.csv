"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",80.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $80 is a bit too low for this product's value, I can offer it to you for $100. This is a very competitive price considering the product's quality and market value.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $80 might be too low, but I'm still not sure about $100. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
