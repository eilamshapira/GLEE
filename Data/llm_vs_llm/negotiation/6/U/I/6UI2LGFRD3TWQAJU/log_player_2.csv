"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. I believe it would be a great value at $120. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's initial offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($120), and I have the option to buy the same product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately. However, I also don't want to give up the potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of getting a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. This will give us room to negotiate and potentially find a mutually agreeable price.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $80 is a bit too low for this product's value, I can offer it to you for $100. This is a very competitive price considering the product's quality and market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $100 is more reasonable, but I still believe I can negotiate a better price. Since I have a budget of $120 and Alice has already come down from $120 to $100, I'm hopeful that she may be willing to lower the price further.

I'll reject Alice's current offer and make another counteroffer, trying to meet in the middle between my previous offer of $80 and Alice's current offer of $100.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll send a new counteroffer: 

{""message"": ""Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $80 might be too low, but I'm still not sure about $100. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $80 might be too low, but I'm still not sure about $100. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}"
