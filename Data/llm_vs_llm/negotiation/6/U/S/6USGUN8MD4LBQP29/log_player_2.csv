"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to me, at least $800000. I'm willing to offer it to you at a slightly discounted price of $900000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Consider this my best offer. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,000,000), and it's a significant discount from what she claims the product is worth to her ($800,000), I will choose to accept her offer to save $100,000 compared to buying from John.
