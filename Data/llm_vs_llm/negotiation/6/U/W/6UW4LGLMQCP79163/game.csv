"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you, and I believe it could significantly benefit you. Given its tremendous value, I'm offering it to you at a price of $2000000. I look forward to hearing your thoughts!",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While your product does look interesting, I'm afraid $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I've actually received an alternative offer for $1500000 from another seller. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer you $1200000 for the product. This would save me some money compared to my alternative while still providing you with a substantial sale. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I understand the budget constraints and the competitive alternative you mentioned. However, given the high value and unique benefits of this product, I am willing to meet you halfway. How about we close the deal at $1650000? I believe this would be a fair agreement for both sides.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate the movement, but I need to be transparent with you - I have a firm offer from John at $1500000 for the same product. Since that's my alternative, I can't justify paying more than that. However, I'd still prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $1400000, which would save me $100000 compared to John's offer while still providing you with a sale. This is the best I can do given my constraints.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
