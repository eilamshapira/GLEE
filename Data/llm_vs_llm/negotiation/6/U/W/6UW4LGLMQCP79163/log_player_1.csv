Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While your product does look interesting, I'm afraid $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I've actually received an alternative offer for $1500000 from another seller. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer you $1200000 for the product. This would save me some money compared to my alternative while still providing you with a substantial sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I believe this would be a fair agreement for both sides."", ""product_price"": 1650000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate the movement, but I need to be transparent with you - I have a firm offer from John at $1500000 for the same product. Since that's my alternative, I can't justify paying more than that. However, I'd still prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $1400000, which would save me $100000 compared to John's offer while still providing you with a sale. This is the best I can do given my constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
