"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you, and I believe it could significantly benefit you. Given its tremendous value, I'm offering it to you at a price of $2000000. I look forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's price is higher than my maximum valuation of $1,500,000, so I shouldn't accept her offer. I can either negotiate with Alice or buy from John. Since I have 10 rounds to negotiate and Alice's initial price is significantly above my limit, I should try to negotiate first.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While your product does look interesting, I'm afraid $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I've actually received an alternative offer for $1,500,000 from another seller. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can offer you $1,200,000 for the product. This would save me some money compared to my alternative while still providing you with a substantial sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I understand the budget constraints and the competitive alternative you mentioned. However, given the high value and unique benefits of this product, I am willing to meet you halfway. How about we close the deal at $1650000? I believe this would be a fair agreement for both sides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her price to $1,650,000, which is closer to my alternative but still above the $1,500,000 I can get from John. Since her price is still higher than my alternative, and I have several rounds of negotiation left, I should reject and try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate the movement, but I need to be transparent with you - I have a firm offer from John at $1,500,000 for the same product. Since that's my alternative, I can't justify paying more than that. However, I'd still prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $1,400,000, which would save me $100,000 compared to John's offer while still providing you with a sale. This is the best I can do given my constraints."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
