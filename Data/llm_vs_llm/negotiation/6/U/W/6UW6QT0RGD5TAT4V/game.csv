"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's quite a bit higher than I was expecting. I'm looking to spend no more than $10000. How about we settle for $5000",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counter, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $5000 is lower than I can accept, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $22000?",22000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $22000 is still quite high. I appreciate your flexibility, but I need to stick to my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $7500.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle. However, $7500 is still too low for me to part with this product. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. How about $19000?",19000.0,Alice,5,
