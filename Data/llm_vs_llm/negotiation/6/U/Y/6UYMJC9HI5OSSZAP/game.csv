"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on its exceptional value and market demand, I'm offering it at $25000. This is a competitive price for the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $25000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd be willing to pay $10000. This is my maximum offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $10000 is below the product's actual value. I already have a guaranteed offer of $15000 from another buyer, but I believe this product would be more valuable to you. I can reduce my initial asking price to $21000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. Would you consider this price?",21000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $21000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the other offers you have,  I'm willing to go up to $15000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving up to $15000, which shows you understand the product's value. However, since I already have a guaranteed offer at that price point, I would need a better offer to choose you over my other buyer. I can come down to $18000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's worth. Would this work for you?",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $18000, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go to $16000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. I truly believe this product is worth it, but this is my absolute limit. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",16000.0,Bob,6,
