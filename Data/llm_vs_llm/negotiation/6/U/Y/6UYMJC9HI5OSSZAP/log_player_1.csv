"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on its exceptional value and market demand, I'm offering it at $25,000. This is a competitive price for the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $25000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd be willing to pay $10000. This is my maximum offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. Bob's offer of $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, which I can get from John. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob to achieve a better price than my alternative option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $10,000 is below the product's actual value. I already have a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from another buyer, but I believe this product would be more valuable to you. I can reduce my initial asking price to $21,000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. Would you consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 21000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $21000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the other offers you have,  I'm willing to go up to $15000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer. Since Bob has moved up to $15,000 (matching John's offer), this shows he has room to negotiate and might be willing to go higher. There's no reason to accept $15,000 from Bob when I can get the same from John, so I'll try one more time to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving up to $15,000, which shows you understand the product's value. However, since I already have a guaranteed offer at that price point, I would need a better offer to choose you over my other buyer. I can come down to $18,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's worth. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $18000, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go to $16000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. I truly believe this product is worth it, but this is my absolute limit. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $16,000. This is a good outcome because:
1. It's $1,000 more than what John is offering ($15,000)
2. Bob has indicated this is his absolute limit, so pushing further might risk losing this better offer
3. We've had several rounds of negotiation, and the progress has been relatively small each time, suggesting we're near the maximum Bob is willing to pay"
