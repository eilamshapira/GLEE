Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $10000 is below the product's actual value. I already have a guaranteed offer of $15000 from another buyer, but I believe this product would be more valuable to you. I can reduce my initial asking price to $21000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. Would you consider this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $21,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $21,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving up to $15000, which shows you understand the product's value. However, since I already have a guaranteed offer at that price point, I would need a better offer to choose you over my other buyer. I can come down to $18000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's worth. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $18,000, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go to $16,000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. I truly believe this product is worth it, but this is my absolute limit. Let me know if this is something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 16000}
