"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm offering you the product at a price of $145. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $145.
2. The product is worth at most $120 to me.
3. I can buy the same product from John for $120.

Since Alice's offer ($145) exceeds both the value of the product to me ($120) and John's price ($120), it doesn't make economic sense to accept Alice's offer.

The most logical choice is to buy from John at $120, as this guarantees I get the product at a price that doesn't exceed its value to me.
