"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I can't accept $700000 as that's below what the product is worth to me. I should mention that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $800000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $875000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know your thoughts.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $875000 is still a bit too high for me. Considering John's offer of $800000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll offer $837500.",837500.0,Bob,4,
