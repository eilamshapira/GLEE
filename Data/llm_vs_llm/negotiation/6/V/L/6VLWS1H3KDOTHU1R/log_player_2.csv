"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $2200000. I believe this price reflects the significant value it holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to consider Alice's offer of $2,200,000 against the alternative of buying from John for $800,000.

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $2,200,000 is significantly higher than that value. It also far exceeds the guaranteed option I have to buy from John at $800,000.

Given that I can immediately purchase the product from John at a price that matches my maximum value for it, there's no reason to accept Alice's much higher offer or continue negotiating.
