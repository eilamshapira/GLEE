"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer ($20,000) is higher than both my maximum value ($15,000) and John's price ($15,000), the rational decision is to buy from John. This way, I can get the product at a price that matches my maximum value and save $5,000 compared to Alice's offer."
