Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be really interested in! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, considering the value of the product to me is no less than $80, and Bob's offer is exactly $80... I need to weigh my options carefully.

I could accept Bob's offer and make $80, which is my minimum acceptable price. Or, I could try to negotiate for a higher price, but there's always a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'll be stuck with the product. I can also sell the product to Jhon for $80 at any time.

Given this situation, I will continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price from Bob.
