"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be really interested in! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's initial offer of $100 is below my maximum budget of $120, I'll consider it. However, I'd like to try to negotiate a better price before making a decision. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice. Since her initial offer was $100, I'll try to negotiate a lower price. I'll offer $80, which is a reasonable starting point for the negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the interest, Bob! I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to get a little more for the product. How about $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has made a counteroffer of $90, which is still below my maximum budget of $120. Since she's already come down from $100 to $90, I'm hopeful that we can reach a mutually agreeable price. However, I'd like to try to negotiate a bit more.

I'll reject Alice's offer of $90 and make another counteroffer. I'll split the difference between my previous offer of $80 and Alice's current offer of $90, and offer $85.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And then I will send a new counteroffer to Alice: 

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer! I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 85}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer! I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $87? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has made another counteroffer of $87, which is very close to my previous offer of $85. At this point, I'm getting close to my target price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too aggressive.

Considering that Alice has already come down significantly from her initial offer of $100, and I'm getting a good price, I think it's time to accept her offer.
