"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's initial offer of $115 is close to my maximum budget of $120, but still slightly above what I'd ideally want to pay, I'll choose to reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try and negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is somewhat lower than Alice's initial offer, to see how she responds. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll aim for a price that's significantly lower than $115, but still reasonable.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $110 is a step in the right direction, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since she was willing to come down from $115 to $110, I'm hoping she'll be willing to negotiate further.

I'll reject her offer again and make another counteroffer, trying to meet somewhere in the middle of my ideal price and her current offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's previous offers and my goal to save as much money as possible, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one, but still lower than Alice's current offer.
