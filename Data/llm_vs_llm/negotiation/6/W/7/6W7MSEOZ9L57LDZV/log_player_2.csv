"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $18000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable item. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since the offered price of $18,000 is higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, which is $15,000, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $15,000.
