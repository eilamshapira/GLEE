"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. Given that I can buy this product elsewhere for $120, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. This would save me money compared to my other option while still giving you a sale. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $100 is a good price, I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $125?  This is still a good deal for you compared to other options, and it helps me make a fair profit.",125.0,Alice,3,
