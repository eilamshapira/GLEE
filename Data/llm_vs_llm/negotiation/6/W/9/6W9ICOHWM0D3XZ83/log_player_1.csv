"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. Given that I can buy this product elsewhere for $120, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. This would save me money compared to my other option while still giving you a sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

This is still a good deal for you compared to other options, and it helps me make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 125}
