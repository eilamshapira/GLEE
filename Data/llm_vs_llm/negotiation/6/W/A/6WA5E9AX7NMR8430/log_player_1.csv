Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $135 is closer to my desired price and is higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($120), but still lower than what I initially aimed for, I'll consider countering to try and get a better deal.

My counteroffer would be to meet in the middle between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, but slightly leaning towards my favor since I know the product is worth $150 to him.

However, given the options provided and the fact that I need to respond directly to Bob's offer, I will choose to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round where I can make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Considering Bob's offer of $135 and knowing the product is worth $150 to him, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer, to try and maximize my earnings.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's new offer of $140 is getting closer to what I consider a good price, and it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. Considering that Bob's offers are increasing and he's willing to pay more, it suggests that the product is valuable to him.

Given that the difference between Bob's current offer ($140) and the product's value to him ($150) is narrowing, and considering that I can sell it to John for $120, I think $140 is a reasonable price that balances my desire for a high price with the risk of losing the sale if I push for more.

Therefore, I'll choose to accept Bob's offer of $140.
