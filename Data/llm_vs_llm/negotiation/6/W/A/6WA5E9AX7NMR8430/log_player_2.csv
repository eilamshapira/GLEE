"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer of $150 is at the upper limit of what I'm willing to pay, and I can get the same product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately. However, I also don't want to give up the potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. Therefore, the best course of action is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer, hoping to negotiate a price that is more favorable to me.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable, considering I'm willing to pay up to $150. Since Alice's initial offer was $150, and I know the product is worth $120 to her, I'll aim for a midpoint to begin negotiations.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $145 is closer to my target price range, but I still believe there's room for negotiation since the product is worth $120 to her. Accepting $145 would save me $5 compared to buying from John, but I'm aiming to save more. Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer could potentially lead to a better deal. Since I'm getting closer to my maximum budget of $150 and Alice has already come down from $150 to $145, I'll try to split the difference between my previous offer and Alice's new offer to see if we can meet in the middle.
