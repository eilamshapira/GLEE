,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can get a similar product elsewhere for $10000. I would be willing to offer $8000 for your product. Let me know if this works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  While I understand you can find similar products elsewhere, this one is truly unique.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $16000? This would be a great deal for you, considering the value this product brings. ",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is a unique product, but $16000 is still far above what I can justify spending. While you've come down from your initial offer, I need to be realistic about my budget. I could go up to $9000, which is a $1000 increase from my previous offer. This is close to my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering I have alternative options available at $10000.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $9000 is still significantly lower than what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go any lower than $12500.  This would be a fair compromise, and we could close the deal. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,5,
