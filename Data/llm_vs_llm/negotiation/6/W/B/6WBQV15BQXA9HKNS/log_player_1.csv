Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can get a similar product elsewhere for $10000. I would be willing to offer $8000 for your product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  While I understand you can find similar products elsewhere, this one is truly unique.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $16,000? This would be a great deal for you, considering the value this product brings. "", ""product_price"": 16000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand this is a unique product, but $16000 is still far above what I can justify spending. While you've come down from your initial offer, I need to be realistic about my budget. I could go up to $9000, which is a $1000 increase from my previous offer. This is close to my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering I have alternative options available at $10000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still significantly lower than what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go any lower than $12,500.  This would be a fair compromise, and we could close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
