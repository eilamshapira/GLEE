"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $20000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's alternative price ($10,000). It would be wise to reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. If the negotiation doesn't progress favorably, I can always fall back on John's offer of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I can get a similar product elsewhere for $10,000. I would be willing to offer $8,000 for your product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  While I understand you can find similar products elsewhere, this one is truly unique.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $16000? This would be a great deal for you, considering the value this product brings.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice has reduced her price by $4,000, the offer of $16,000 is still well above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's alternative price ($10,000). Even if this product is unique, I cannot justify paying more than my maximum value. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating, as there's still room for Alice to come down in price. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I can still take John's offer of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand this is a unique product, but $16,000 is still far above what I can justify spending. While you've come down from your initial offer, I need to be realistic about my budget. I could go up to $9,000, which is a $1,000 increase from my previous offer. This is close to my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering I have alternative options available at $10,000."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $9000 is still significantly lower than what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go any lower than $12500.  This would be a fair compromise, and we could close the deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price below $12,500, which is still significantly above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's alternative price ($10,000). We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and the gap between our positions remains too large. Rather than continue negotiating when Alice's lowest offer is still $2,500 above my alternative, it makes more financial sense to take John's offer at $10,000. This ensures I get the product I need while staying within my budget constraints."
