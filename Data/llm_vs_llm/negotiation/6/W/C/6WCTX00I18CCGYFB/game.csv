"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2000000. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm open to negotiations.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $2000000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to make a significant investment. However, $1000000 is below the product's value to me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to its true worth. Let's meet in the middle between your offer and my initial price. I'm offering it to you for $1500000.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1500000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to offer $1250000.  This is a fair compromise that shows my commitment to acquiring your product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a slightly higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your latest offer and my previous one. Let's settle on $1375000.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility, $1375000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1300000. This is a significant amount for me and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I think we're very close to a deal. I appreciate your latest offer, and I'm willing to make a small concession to meet you closer to your price. I'm offering the product to you for $1325000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! While your offer is tempting, I'm still going to stick to my last price of $1300000. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial price. Let's close the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
