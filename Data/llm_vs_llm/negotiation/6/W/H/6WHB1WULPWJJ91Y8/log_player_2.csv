"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I notice that Alice's offer is $120, which is the same price John is offering. Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and both options cost the same, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer immediately.

I should try to negotiate with Alice to see if I can get a better price, since I can always fall back on John's $120 offer if negotiations don't work out.
