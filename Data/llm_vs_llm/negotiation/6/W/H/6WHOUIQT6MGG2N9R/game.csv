"Bob, I'm thrilled to be offering you this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm willing to sell it to you for $2500000. This is a fantastic opportunity. What do you say?",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but the price is far beyond my budget. I am willing to buy the product for no more than $500000. Would you consider this counteroffer?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $500000 is simply not feasible for me. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $2000000? I believe this is a fair price.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, $2000000 is still too high for me. I'm ready to raise my offer to $750000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $750000 still falls quite short of the product's value. Given your previous offer, I am willing to come down further. How about $1750000? This is my final offer and I am very confident in the value of the product.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1750000 is still beyond what I'm willing to spend. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $875000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering my budget and the product's value.",875000.0,Bob,6,
