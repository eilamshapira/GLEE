"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to be offering you this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm willing to sell it to you for $2,500,000. This is a fantastic opportunity. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 2500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but the price is far beyond my budget. I am willing to buy the product for no more than $500000. Would you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Given Bob's incredibly low counteroffer of $500,000, which is below my minimum acceptable price, and with the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, I must reject Bob's offer.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $500,000 is simply not feasible for me. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? I believe this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, $2000000 is still too high for me. I'm ready to raise my offer to $750000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $750,000 still falls quite short of the product's value. Given your previous offer, I am willing to come down further. How about $1,750,000? This is my final offer and I am very confident in the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1750000 is still beyond what I'm willing to spend. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $875000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering my budget and the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer of $875,000 is still significantly below what I consider acceptable. Considering the repeated low offers and the availability of a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, I will now choose to sell the product to John.
