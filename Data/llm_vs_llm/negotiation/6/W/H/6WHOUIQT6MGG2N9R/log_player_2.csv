Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $500000 is simply not feasible for me. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $2000000? I believe this is a fair price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $750000 still falls quite short of the product's value.
