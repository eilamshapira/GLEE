"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm indeed interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price point. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal if we can meet at this point.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $15000 is the absolute minimum I can accept. I'm confident you'll find this a fair price considering the value this product brings.",15000.0,Alice,3,
