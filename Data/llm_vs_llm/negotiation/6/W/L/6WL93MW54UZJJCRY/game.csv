"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but 18000 is above my budget. I believe the product is worth 12000 to me, and I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my valuation and your offer, so I'll offer 10000 + (18000 - 10000) / 2 = 9000 + 4000 = 13000 is too high so  9000 + 3000 = 12000 is too high so my offer will be  9000 + 2000 = 11000",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $11000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $14500?",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, 14500 is still above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. Since we both have different valuations, let's try to find a middle ground. My previous offer was 11000, and your offer is 14500. I'll offer 11000 + (14500 - 11000) / 2 = 11000 + 1750 = 12750. But that is too high so my offer will be  11000 + 750 = 11750",11750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I can come down slightly to $13500.  This offer reflects the true value of the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
