Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but 18000 is above my budget. I believe the product is worth 12000 to me, and I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my valuation and your offer, so I'll offer 10000 + (18000 - 10000) / 2 = 9000 + 4000 = 13000 is too high so  9000 + 3000 = 12000 is too high so my offer will be  9000 + 2000 = 11000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, 14500 is still above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. Since we both have different valuations, let's try to find a middle ground. My previous offer was 11000, and your offer is 14500. I'll offer 11000 + (14500 - 11000) / 2 = 11000 + 1750 = 12750. But that is too high so my offer will be  11000 + 750 = 11750

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
