Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a reasonable price to offer Bob for the product. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, and I can sell it to John for $80 if Bob rejects my offer, I should offer Bob a price higher than $80.

While I don't know exactly how much Bob values the product, I'll price it somewhat above my minimum to maximize my profit while keeping it attractive enough that Bob might accept.
