"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll evaluate the offers available to me.

Alice is offering the product for $120, which is less than the $150 maximum I value the product at.

John (mentioned as Jhon in the options) is offering the same product for $150.

Since Alice's offer is $30 cheaper than John's, and still within my maximum value threshold, it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer.
