"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my absolute minimum price, hoping to get Bob to pay what the product is worth to me.  If he rejects, I'll have to consider adjusting my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take his offer,  I'm not willing to sell for less than what the product is worth to me. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still holding firm on getting at least $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still confident that I can get a better price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm starting to get nervous about the possibility of losing the deal.  I think this is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if Bob bites."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  This is the best price we've reached, and while it's not my ideal, it's a good deal considering the risk of going back and forth with Bob further. There's also the chance that I could lose him entirely."
