"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $25000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $5000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $5000 is just too low. Given the product's value, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. How about $22000?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit, but $22000 is still too high for my budget. The maximum I'm willing to spend is $7000. How about that?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to consider. However, $7000 is significantly below the product's worth. I'm still confident you'll see its value. How about we meet in the middle at $18000?",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still way too much. I'm getting close to just buying from someone else. I can offer you $8000, and that's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're at your limit. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. Let's make this the last offer. Considering the value, I can go down to $16000. This is my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,7,
