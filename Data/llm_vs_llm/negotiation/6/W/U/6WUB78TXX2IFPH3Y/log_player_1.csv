Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be very interested in. I'm looking to sell it for $25,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $25000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $5000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Okay, Bob's counteroffer is far too low. I definitely won't accept $5,000. I need to try and get a better price.

My decision is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $5,000 is just too low. Given the product's value, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. How about $22,000?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down a bit, but $22000 is still too high for my budget. The maximum I'm willing to spend is $7000. How about that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Again, Bob's offer is too low. I need to get at least $15,000 to match what John is offering.

My decision is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to consider. However, $7,000 is significantly below the product's worth. I'm still confident you'll see its value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still way too much. I'm getting close to just buying from someone else. I can offer you $8000, and that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is still too low, even though he claims it's his final offer. It's not worth selling for $8,000. I am not sure how valuable the product is to Bob, so I will reject this offer and try to negotiate one more time.

My decision is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're at your limit. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. Let's make this the last offer. Considering the value, I can go down to $16,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
