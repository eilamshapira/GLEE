"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I think $20000 is too high. I'm looking to spend no more than $12000. How about we meet in the middle at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $12000. Considering your willingness to meet in the middle, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price. How about we try $18000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $18000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's split the difference again and say $15000?",15000.0,Bob,4,
