"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its worth to me."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I think $20000 is too high. I'm looking to spend no more than $12000. How about we meet in the middle at $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($15,000) and also lower than what I know Bob is willing to pay ($15,000), I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer that is closer to my target price but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $12,000. Considering your willingness to meet in the middle, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price. How about we try $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $18000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's split the difference again and say $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $15,000 matches the minimum value I have for the product and also matches what I know Bob is willing to pay, and considering that selling to John would also be for $15,000, I see no benefit in continuing to negotiate or selling to John instead. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal now without risking further negotiation that might not yield a better price.
