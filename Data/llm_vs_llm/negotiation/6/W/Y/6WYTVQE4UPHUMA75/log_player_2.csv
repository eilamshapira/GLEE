# Bob's counteroffer: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I think $20,000 is too high. I'm looking to spend no more than $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $12000. Considering your willingness to meet in the middle, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price. How about we try $18000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

# Bob's counteroffer: Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $18,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's split the difference again and say $15,000?"
