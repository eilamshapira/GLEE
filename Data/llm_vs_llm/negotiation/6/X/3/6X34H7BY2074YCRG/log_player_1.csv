"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is lower than the minimum value of $10,000 that the product is worth to me, and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

My counteroffer is: $12,000

So, the response is not one of the three options you specified, but rather a counteroffer. If I had to choose one of the options, it would be:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Bob a counteroffer of $12,000.

Formally, the response is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 12000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is still lower than my previous counteroffer of $12,000, but closer to the minimum value of $10,000 that the product is worth to me, I will reject Bob's offer. However, I will also consider that I can get $10,000 from John, so I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob.

My counteroffer is: $11,000

So, the response is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 11000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,500 is still lower than my previous counteroffer of $11,000, but getting closer, I will reject Bob's offer. Considering that I can get $10,000 from John, which is still higher than Bob's offer, I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob.

My counteroffer is: $10,500

So, the response is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 10500}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,750 is still lower than my previous counteroffer of $10,500, but very close to the offer from John of $10,000, I will consider my options carefully. Given that I have only a few rounds left to negotiate and Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable price, I will try to meet him in the middle.

My counteroffer is: $10,250

So, the response is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 10250}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 matches the minimum value that the product is worth to me and also matches the offer from John, I will accept Bob's offer. There's no benefit in rejecting Bob's offer now since I can get the same price from John, and accepting Bob's offer will conclude the negotiation.
