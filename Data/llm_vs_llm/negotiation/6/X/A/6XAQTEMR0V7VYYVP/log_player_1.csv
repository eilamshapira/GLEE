Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic decision about the price to offer Bob. I want to maximize my earnings, but I also need to be mindful that if I set the price too high, Bob might reject my offer.

Since the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at exactly $10,000, I have nothing to lose by offering Bob a higher price. If Bob rejects my offer, I'm no worse off.

Given that I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll set a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value, but not so high that it would immediately seem unreasonable.
