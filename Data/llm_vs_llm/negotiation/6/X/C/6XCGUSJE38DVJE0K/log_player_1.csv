Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 12000}

Explanation (though not part of the formal response):
I'm offering the price of $12,000 because:
1. The product is worth at least $12,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000
3. The product is only worth $10,000 to Bob, so he will likely reject any offer above that
4. Since I can get $12,000 from John, there's no reason to offer a lower price to Bob
By offering $12,000, I ensure I'll get the maximum value, either from Bob (unlikely) or from John (guaranteed)."
