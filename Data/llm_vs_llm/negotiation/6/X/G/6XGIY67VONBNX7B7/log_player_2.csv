"Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and John is offering it for exactly $100, Alice's offer of $250 is much too high. There's no reason for me to accept it when I have a guaranteed option to get the product at my maximum valuation.
