"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit on what I'm willing to spend.  Would you consider a significantly lower price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that my initial price may have been out of your budget, but I still believe the product has a higher value. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to make a counteroffer that's lower than my initial price, but still reflects the product's worth.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still quite a ways away from what I had in mind. To be honest, $18000 is more than I'm looking to spend. If you're willing to meet somewhere closer to the middle, I'm ready to talk.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. I've considered your offer of $9000, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than that. I'd like to propose a price of $12000, which I think is a fair compromise. If you're interested, I'm open to discussing the details.",12000.0,Alice,5,
