Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit on what I'm willing to spend.  Would you consider a significantly lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $6,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and I believe the product is worth more. I'll try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 

My counteroffer: $18,000"

I understand that my initial price may have been out of your budget, but I still believe the product has a higher value. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still quite a ways away from what I had in mind. To be honest, $18000 is more than I'm looking to spend. If you're willing to meet somewhere closer to the middle, I'm ready to talk. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $9,000 is still lower than I'm comfortable with. However, I'm also getting closer to the point where selling to John for $15,000 might be a better option. I'll try to find a compromise with Bob, but I won't go too low.

My counteroffer: $12,000"
