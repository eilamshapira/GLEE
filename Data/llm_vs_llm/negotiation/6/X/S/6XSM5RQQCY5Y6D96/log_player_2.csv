"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is far too high. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept an offer that's so much higher than my maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit on what I'm willing to spend.  Would you consider a significantly lower price?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a low offer ($6,000) to see how Alice responds. This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for negotiation.
* **Gauging Alice's Reaction:** Her reaction to this offer will give me valuable information about her flexibility and the potential for reaching a deal.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always buy from John for $12,000 if the negotiations with Alice don't work out in my favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that my initial price may have been out of your budget, but I still believe the product has a higher value. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to make a counteroffer that's lower than my initial price, but still reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's price has come down, it's still significantly higher than both my initial offer and my upper limit. I need to show her I'm serious about a lower price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still quite a ways away from what I had in mind. To be honest, $18,000 is more than I'm looking to spend. If you're willing to meet somewhere closer to the middle, I'm ready to talk."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing Incrementally:** I'm increasing my offer by a larger amount this time ($3,000) to demonstrate willingness to move towards a compromise.
* **Firm but Fair:** My message emphasizes that $18,000 is beyond my budget, setting a clear boundary. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Offering $9,000 aims to gauge if a price in this range is even a possibility with Alice.  

The goal is to find a sweet spot between appearing too stubborn and potentially missing out on a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. I've considered your offer of $9000, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than that. I'd like to propose a price of $12000, which I think is a fair compromise. If you're interested, I'm open to discussing the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my original maximum price.  While I might be able to negotiate her down a little further, it's unlikely to be a significant amount. It's not worth the risk of her retracting the offer, and it's better to secure the product at the price I'm comfortable with.  John is offering the same price without further negotiation."
