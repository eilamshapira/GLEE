"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is significantly higher than my maximum value of $12,000 and even higher than John's fixed price. It would be better to reject and make a counteroffer, as there's still plenty of negotiation rounds left to potentially get a better deal from Alice. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I can always buy from John later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 8000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $8,000. This is significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price, which gives room for negotiation. Since my maximum value is $12,000, starting at $8,000 leaves space for potential increases in future rounds while still keeping the final price potentially below John's offer of $12,000."
