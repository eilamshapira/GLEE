"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great fit for you. Given its significant market value and unique features, I'm offering it at $1500000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I cannot accept $1500000 for the product. This exceeds what I'm willing to pay, especially considering I can purchase the same product from John for $1000000. I understand you value the product at $1000000 yourself, so I'm willing to offer you $900000. This allows you to make a quick sale while giving me some savings compared to John's price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept $900000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. As you mentioned, John is willing to pay $1000000, which reflects the true market value of the product. However, I'd prefer to work with you. I can offer you the product for $1100000, which is significantly lower than my initial offer. This still gives you the benefit of the product's full value while providing me with a fair return.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $1100000 still doesn't make sense for me when John is offering the same product for $1000000. I'm willing to pay $950000, which gives you a reasonable profit while still providing me with some savings compared to John's price. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both.",950000.0,Bob,4,
