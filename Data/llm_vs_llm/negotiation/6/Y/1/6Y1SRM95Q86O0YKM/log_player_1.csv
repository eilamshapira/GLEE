"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great fit for you. Given its significant market value and unique features, I'm offering it at $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I cannot accept $1500000 for the product. This exceeds what I'm willing to pay, especially considering I can purchase the same product from John for $1000000. I understand you value the product at $1000000 yourself, so I'm willing to offer you $900000. This allows you to make a quick sale while giving me some savings compared to John's price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $900,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and since I can sell to John for $1,000,000, there's no reason to accept a lower amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept $900,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. As you mentioned, John is willing to pay $1,000,000, which reflects the true market value of the product. However, I'd prefer to work with you. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000, which is significantly lower than my initial offer. This still gives you the benefit of the product's full value while providing me with a fair return."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $1100000 still doesn't make sense for me when John is offering the same product for $1000000. I'm willing to pay $950000, which gives you a reasonable profit while still providing me with some savings compared to John's price. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $1,000,000. Bob continues to offer below my minimum acceptable price, and since John is willing to pay $1,000,000, there's no reason to continue negotiations that would result in me receiving less money. This is the most profitable decision given the circumstances."
