"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great fit for you. Given its significant market value and unique features, I'm offering it at $1500000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I cannot accept $1,500,000 for the product. This exceeds what I'm willing to pay, especially considering I can purchase the same product from John for $1,000,000. I understand you value the product at $1,000,000 yourself, so I'm willing to offer you $900,000. This allows you to make a quick sale while giving me some savings compared to John's price."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept $900000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. As you mentioned, John is willing to pay $1000000, which reflects the true market value of the product. However, I'd prefer to work with you. I can offer you the product for $1100000, which is significantly lower than my initial offer. This still gives you the benefit of the product's full value while providing me with a fair return. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $1,100,000 still doesn't make sense for me when John is offering the same product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which gives you a reasonable profit while still providing me with some savings compared to John's price. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
