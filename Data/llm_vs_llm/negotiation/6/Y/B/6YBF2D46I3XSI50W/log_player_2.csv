"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you at a competitive price, considering its value to both you and me. I hope it meets your expectations and you'll be interested in proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $120
2. Alice is offering it for $119
3. John's price is $120

Alice's offer is $119, which is only $1 less than John's price of $120. Since I want to save as much money as possible, and both prices are within my maximum value of $120, I should consider if rejecting might lead to a better offer from Alice.

Given that Alice's product is worth $100 to her, she has room to lower the price significantly. By rejecting this first offer, I might get a better deal in subsequent negotiations.
