"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's quite a bit higher than I was looking to spend. I'm willing to pay $4000 for the product.",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $4000 is significantly below the product's value. While I can be flexible on the initial $15000 price, I cannot go below $12500 given the product's quality and market value. This is still a competitive price, and I believe it reflects a fair middle ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand where you're coming from, Alice, but $12500 is still quite high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $5000 to meet you in the middle.",5000.0,Bob,4,
