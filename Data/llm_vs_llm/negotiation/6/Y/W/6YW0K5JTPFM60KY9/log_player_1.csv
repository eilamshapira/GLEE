Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $15,000. This is a competitive price for what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's quite a bit higher than I was looking to spend. I'm willing to pay $4000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $4,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and even below John's guaranteed offer. I will make a new counteroffer to Bob in the next round, but if we can't reach a more reasonable price, I always have the option to sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $4,000 is significantly below the product's value. While I can be flexible on the initial $15,000 price, I cannot go below $12,500 given the product's quality and market value. This is still a competitive price, and I believe it reflects a fair middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice, but $12500 is still quite high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $5000 to meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:

I've decided to sell to John. Bob's offer of $5,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and while I appreciated the negotiation, the gap between our positions is too large. John's guaranteed offer of $10,000 is the better business decision at this point."
