"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this exclusive product for $1200000. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer ($1,200,000) is higher than both my maximum budget ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), the logical choice would be to buy from John.
