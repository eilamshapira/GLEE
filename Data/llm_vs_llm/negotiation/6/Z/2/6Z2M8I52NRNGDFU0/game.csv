"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. I understand you have budget constraints, but I can't sell below $80 as that's my minimum threshold. Given the quality and value of this product, I can come down to $105. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents great value. Would this work for you?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $105 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $75. It's the best I can do.",75.0,Bob,4,
