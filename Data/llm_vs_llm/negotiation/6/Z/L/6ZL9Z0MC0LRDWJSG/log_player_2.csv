"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to you. Given the quality and potential benefits of this product, I'm offering it to you for $1800000. This is a competitive price considering the product's market value and the advantages it would bring to your business. I already have another buyer, John, who is interested, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity to acquire it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
