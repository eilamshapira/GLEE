(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $90 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($80), but lower than my initial offer ($110), I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $100.

My next counteroffer will be $98.

I'll try to meet him in the middle. My next counteroffer will be $97.
