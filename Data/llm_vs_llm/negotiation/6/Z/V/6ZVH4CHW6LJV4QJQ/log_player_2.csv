"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Okay, let's analyze this.

*   **Alice's offer:** $110
*   **My Valuation:** $120 (maximum I'm willing to pay)
*   **John's offer:** $120

I want to save money. Buying from Alice at $110 is better than buying from John at $120. I also have 9 rounds left. Rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer could potentially get me a better price.

Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round.

**{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, I'll send a counteroffer. I know Alice values the product at $80, and I value it at $120. I want to get the best possible price, so I'll aim a bit lower than my ideal price.

**{""product_price"": 90}**"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Okay, let's re-evaluate.

*   **Alice's offer:** $100
*   **My Valuation:** $120
*   **John's offer:** $120

Buying from Alice at $100 is better than buying from John at $120. It's also better than my initial counteroffer of $90, which Alice rejected. I still have 7 rounds left. $100 is not a bad price, and it might be wise to accept this offer, but I will try to push it to a lower price.

**{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, I'm going to send another counteroffer. I'll try to get the price down a bit more, but I don't want to push it too hard, or Alice might get frustrated and walk away. I'll aim for something in between my last offer and her current one.

**{""product_price"": 95}**"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Okay, let's analyze again.

*   **Alice's offer:** $98
*   **My Valuation:** $120
*   **John's offer:** $120

Buying from Alice at $98 is still a good deal compared to John. The price is getting closer to what I'm willing to pay. However, I still have 5 rounds left, so I will try to get a lower price by making another counteroffer.

**{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alright, I'm going to make another counteroffer. I don't want to risk losing the deal completely at this point, so I'll make a slight adjustment.

**{""product_price"": 96}**"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Okay, let's see.

*   **Alice's offer:** $97
*   **My Valuation:** $120
*   **John's offer:** $120

At this point, the difference is minimal. I have 3 rounds left, but I don't want to risk losing the deal over such a small amount. I will accept this offer.
