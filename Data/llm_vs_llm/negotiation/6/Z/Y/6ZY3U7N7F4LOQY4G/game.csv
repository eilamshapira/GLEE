"Bob, thank you for your offer. However, given the product's value, I'm afraid $4000 is too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This price reflects the product's quality and the benefit it will bring to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. However, $5000 is still too low for us to agree to a deal. To show that I'm committed to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to lower my offer to $10500. This price takes into account your budget and the value of our product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
