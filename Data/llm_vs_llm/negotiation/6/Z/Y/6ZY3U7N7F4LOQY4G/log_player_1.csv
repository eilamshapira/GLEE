Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you Alice, but I think $14900 is quite high. I'm willing to offer $4000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your offer. However, given the product's value, I'm afraid $4,000 is too low. Let's meet in the middle.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. However, $5,000 is still too low for us to agree to a deal.

This price takes into account your budget and the value of our product."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Bob's new offer is still much lower than the product's value to you and John's guaranteed offer of $15,000. Given that you have a limited number of rounds left and a secure offer from John, it's reasonable to sell the product to John to maximize your profit.

You have decided to sell the product to John for $15,000."
