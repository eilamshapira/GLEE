(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer ($50) is below my minimum acceptable price ($80), and I have John's guaranteed offer of $80, I'll reject Bob's low offer and make a counteroffer. There's still plenty of rounds left for negotiation.

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer of $65 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80, and I have a guaranteed offer from John at $80. Given that Bob's second offer only increased by $15, the negotiation isn't moving quickly enough towards an acceptable price. Since I have a better guaranteed option, I'll take John's offer.
