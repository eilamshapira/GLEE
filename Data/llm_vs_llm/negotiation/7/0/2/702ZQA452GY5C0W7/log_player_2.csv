"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me. Alice is offering it for $2,000,000. This is far too high. Buying from John is cheaper than accepting Alice's offer.
