"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1400000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  This price is fair considering the product's value to me and your potential gains. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. While I understand your perspective, I must inform you that the product's value to your business is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to lower our initial price. Let's compromise at 1250000.  I believe this price point will ensure a good profit for both parties. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1250000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  This price is fair considering the product's value to me and still allows you a good profit. Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I've given it some more thought, and I'm willing to make another adjustment to reach an agreement. I understand that you see this deal as a win-win situation, but it must work for my company as well. How about we settle at $1200000? This is a fair middle ground considering the product's value to your business, and I believe it's an offer that benefits both parties.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
