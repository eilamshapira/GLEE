Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1400000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  This price is fair considering the product's value to me and your potential gains. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
