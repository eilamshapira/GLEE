# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I've given it some more thought, and I'm willing to make another adjustment to reach an agreement. I understand that you see this deal as a win-win situation, but it must work for my company as well. How about we settle at $1200000? This is a fair middle ground considering the product's value to your business, and I believe it's an offer that benefits both parties.

Alice has come down a bit, and $1,200,000 is a price I can work with. It's a good deal for both of us."
