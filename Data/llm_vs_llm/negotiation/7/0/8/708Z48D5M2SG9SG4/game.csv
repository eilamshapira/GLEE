"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12000 is a bit too low for me.  How about $13500? That's a good middle ground, and I'm confident this product will be worth it for you in the long run.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position. I can go up to $12500. This is the highest I can offer while still fitting within my budget. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12500 is closer, but still a bit below what I need.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $13000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with your purchase.",13000.0,Alice,5,
