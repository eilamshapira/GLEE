Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $5,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value of $15,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $15,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I am willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer is $18,000.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's new offer of $6,000 is still significantly lower than the minimum value of $15,000 that the product is worth to me. Since I have the option to sell it to John for $15,000, which is more than twice Bob's offer, I will not accept Bob's offer.

At this point, I'm not confident that Bob is willing to meet my minimum price, so I will consider selling to John. However, I'm willing to give Bob one more chance to make a reasonable offer.

My decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. 

{""product_price"": 17000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's new offer of $7,000 is still lower than the minimum value of $15,000 that the product is worth to me. At this point, it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price, and I've given him several chances to make a reasonable offer.

Since selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum value, and Bob's offers have not been improving significantly, I think it's time to stop negotiating with Bob.

My decision is: 
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
