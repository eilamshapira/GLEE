Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the product, but $18000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $15000 to me, and I can actually purchase the same product from another seller, John, for exactly $15000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. I'm willing to offer you $12500 for the product. This gives you a reasonable profit while allowing me to save a bit compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down in price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be transparent with you - I can purchase this exact product from John for $15000. In fact, that's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product based on its value to me. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I need a better price than my alternative. I'm willing to offer you $13500, which still gives you a reasonable profit while offering me some savings compared to my other option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and your alternative. I'm willing to move closer to your offer, but I also need to ensure I'm getting a fair value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that works for both of us. However, I need to emphasize that I can purchase this product from John for $15000, and that's the maximum value of this product to me. There's no particular advantage for me to pay more than that. In fact, to make it worthwhile for me to continue negotiating rather than just going with John's offer, I need to see some savings. My offer is $14200, which still gives you a reasonable profit above the product's worth to you. If we can't reach an agreement below $15000, I'll need to take John's offer instead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
