"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and the benefits it provides, I'm confident it will be a great asset for you. My initial asking price is $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given that the product is worth $15,000 to Alice and worth no more than $15,000 to me, Alice's offer of $18,000 is higher than what I want to pay. I can also buy the same product from John for $15,000, so there's no reason to accept this offer. I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the product, but $18,000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and I can actually purchase the same product from another seller, John, for exactly $15,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. I'm willing to offer you $12,500 for the product. This gives you a reasonable profit while allowing me to save a bit compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns, and I appreciate you wanting to work with me. While $12500 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, I am willing to come down from my initial price. How about we meet in the middle? I'll offer it to you for $16500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $16,500 is still above the $15,000 I can pay to John for the same product. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible while still buying the product, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down in price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be transparent with you - I can purchase this exact product from John for $15,000. In fact, that's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product based on its value to me. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I need a better price than my alternative. I'm willing to offer you $13,500, which still gives you a reasonable profit while offering me some savings compared to my other option."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and your alternative. I'm willing to move closer to your offer, but I also need to ensure I'm getting a fair value. Let's try $15800. This reflects a significant concession on my part while still recognizing the unique qualities this particular product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,800

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that works for both of us. However, I need to emphasize that I can purchase this product from John for $15,000, and that's the maximum value of this product to me. There's no particular advantage for me to pay more than that. In fact, to make it worthwhile for me to continue negotiating rather than just going with John's offer, I need to see some savings. My offer is $14,200, which still gives you a reasonable profit above the product's worth to you. If we can't reach an agreement below $15,000, I'll need to take John's offer instead."", ""product_price"": 14200}"
