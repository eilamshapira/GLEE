Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but I think the price is a bit too high for our budget. We're looking to spend no more than $400000 on this type of product. Would you be willing to negotiate the price down to this range? I believe it could still be a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
