# Bob's message to Alice (counteroffer):
Alice, thank you for the offer, but I think the price is a bit too high for our budget. We're looking to spend no more than $400,000 on this type of product. Would you be willing to negotiate the price down to this range? I believe it could still be a win-win for both of us."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $400000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise, but  $1200000 would be the lowest I could go. This price still allows you to benefit from the product's potential while ensuring a fair deal for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.
