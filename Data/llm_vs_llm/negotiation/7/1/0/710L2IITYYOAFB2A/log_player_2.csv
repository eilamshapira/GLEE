"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer is $1,200,000
2. John's fixed price is $1,500,000
3. I can buy the product for up to $1,500,000
4. Alice's initial offer is $300,000 less than John's price
5. This is just the first round, so I might be able to negotiate an even better price

Alice's opening offer of $1,200,000 is already significantly better than John's price, but since this is the first round and we have 9 more rounds to negotiate, I should try to get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice opened with $1,200,000, which is already a reasonable price, I should make a counteroffer that's not too aggressive but still tries to get a better deal. I'll aim for a 20% reduction from her initial offer.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. Your product interests me, but I was hoping we could reach a more favorable price. Would you consider $950,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the product's value is still higher than your last offer. How about we settle at $1050000? This is a significant reduction from my initial price and should reflect the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's initial offer was $1,200,000
2. I countered with $950,000
3. Alice has now come down to $1,050,000, which is:
   - $150,000 less than her initial offer
   - $450,000 less than John's price
   - Only $100,000 more than my counteroffer

This is a very good movement from Alice, showing she's willing to negotiate significantly. While we could potentially negotiate further, the current offer is already excellent, being $450,000 less than our maximum price point (John's offer). The risk of pushing too hard might not be worth the potential small additional savings.
