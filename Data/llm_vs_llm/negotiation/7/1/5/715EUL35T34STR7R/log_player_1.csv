"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth a premium price, and I'm willing to let it go for $140."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $140 is quite high for me. Given the market conditions and my budget constraints, I can offer $90 for the product. This is a fair price that I believe works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $90 is lower than what the product is worth to me, and I know I can sell it to John for $120, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price. My next offer will be lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $140 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm afraid $90 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $130."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $140 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm afraid $90 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $130."", ""product_price"": 130}"
