"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth a premium price, and I'm willing to let it go for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me think about this:

1. Alice is offering the product for $140
2. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
3. I have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $100
4. Alice's cost is $120, so she has room to negotiate down

Given that:
1. $140 is well above my maximum value ($100)
2. I have 10 rounds to negotiate
3. John's offer of $100 is always available as a backup

I should reject this initial high offer and try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. If negotiations don't go well, I can always go with John's offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly below my maximum value, leaving room for potential negotiation while still being reasonable given Alice's costs.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $140 is quite high for me. Given the market conditions and my budget constraints, I can offer $90 for the product. This is a fair price that I believe works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $140 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm afraid $90 is too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice has only reduced her price by $10 (from $140 to $130)
2. $130 is still well above both:
   - My maximum value ($100)
   - John's guaranteed offer ($100)
3. Alice's cost is $120, so she still has room to negotiate
4. We still have several rounds left

However, given that:
1. Alice only came down $10 from her initial offer
2. She rejected my $90 offer
3. Her cost is $120
4. I have a guaranteed $100 option with John

At this point, it's clear that Alice is not moving quickly towards a price that would be acceptable to me (below $100). Since I have John's guaranteed offer at $100, and that's my maximum value anyway, it makes more sense to take John's offer rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to result in a better deal.
