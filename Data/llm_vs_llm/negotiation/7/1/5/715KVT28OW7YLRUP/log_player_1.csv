Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make an offer to Bob for my product that's worth at least $1,000,000 to me. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, that's my fallback position. I should start with a higher offer to Bob to leave room for negotiation if needed.

{""product_price"": $1,500,000}"
