"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I notice that Alice's offer is $1,500,000, which is more than the $1,000,000 maximum value the product is worth to me. Since John is willing to sell the product for exactly $1,000,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay, I should buy from John instead.
