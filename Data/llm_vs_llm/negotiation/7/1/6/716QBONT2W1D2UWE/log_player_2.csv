"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have that product you were interested in! I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer of $90 is still too high. You can try to negotiate a better price or see if she's willing to come down further. You can always buy it from John for $100 if you need to."
