"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $115, which I think is a fair price given its quality and value.",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $115 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to meet me at this price.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $90 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. Given that the product's value and quality justify a higher price, I can offer it to you for $110. This is already a reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that works for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for reducing the price to $110. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit short of being comfortable with that price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $100. I believe this is a reasonable price, and I'm willing to finalize the deal if you're willing to meet me at this price.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate that you've moved up to $100, which shows we're making progress in our negotiation. However, considering the product's value and quality, I can offer it to you for $105. This is a very reasonable price point that's significantly lower than my initial offer, and it represents good value given the product's worth to you.",105.0,Alice,5,
