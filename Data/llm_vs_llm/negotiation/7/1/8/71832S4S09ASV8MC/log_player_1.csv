Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $115, which I think is a fair price given its quality and value."", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $115 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob since $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and I can always get $100 from John. Bob has shown interest in negotiating, so there's still potential to reach a better price than John's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $90 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. Given that the product's value and quality justify a higher price, I can offer it to you for $110.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for reducing the price to $110. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit short of being comfortable with that price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $100. I believe this is a reasonable price, and I'm willing to finalize the deal if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer because Bob has moved up to $100, showing he's willing to negotiate upward. Since this matches John's offer, and we know the product is worth $120 to Bob, there's still room to negotiate for a better price rather than accepting $100 from either buyer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate that you've moved up to $100, which shows we're making progress in our negotiation. However, considering the product's value and quality, I can offer it to you for $105. This is a very reasonable price point that's significantly lower than my initial offer, and it represents good value given the product's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 105}"
