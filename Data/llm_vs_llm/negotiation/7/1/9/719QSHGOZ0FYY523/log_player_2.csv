"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to consider my options carefully. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $15,000, which exceeds my maximum value. John is offering the same product for $12,000, which is at my maximum acceptable price.

Since Alice's offer is too high and exceeds both my maximum value and John's alternative price, I should reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has lowered her price to $13,000, which is better than her initial $15,000 offer, but it's still higher than John's price of $12,000 and exceeds my maximum valuation of the product. Since I can buy the same product from John at exactly my maximum value of $12,000, and Alice's offer is still above that, I should reject Alice's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make one more counteroffer that's higher than my previous one to show I'm willing to meet somewhere in the middle, but still below John's price since that remains my best alternative.
