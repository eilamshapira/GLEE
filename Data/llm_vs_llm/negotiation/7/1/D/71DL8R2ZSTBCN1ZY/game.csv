"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $11500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe the product is valuable, but the price of $11500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000, considering the product's worth and my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $9000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. Given that the product's value is significant, I can offer it to you for $11000, which is a reasonable reduction from my initial offer.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for reducing the price to $11000. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still looking to get a better deal. Considering my budget and the product's value, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. This price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I see we're getting closer to an agreement. Your offer of $10000 shows good faith, but I know this product provides significant value. I can come down to $10500, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and is a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10500. We're indeed getting closer to an agreement. However, I'm trying to stay within a tight budget. Given that your initial price was $11500 and you've already reduced it, I'm hoping we can meet in the middle of your last offer and my previous offer. I'd like to propose $10250 as a counteroffer, which I believe is a reasonable compromise.",10250.0,Bob,6,
