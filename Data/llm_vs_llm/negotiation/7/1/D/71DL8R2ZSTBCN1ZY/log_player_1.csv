Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe the product is valuable, but the price of $11500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000, considering the product's worth and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and even below John's offer. Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, so I think we can reach a better agreement.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $9,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. Given that the product's value is significant, I can offer it to you for $11,000, which is a reasonable reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 11000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for reducing the price to $11000. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still looking to get a better deal. Considering my budget and the product's value, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. This price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair offer.

I'll make another counteroffer since Bob has moved up significantly from $9,000 to $10,000, showing he has room to negotiate further. Since the product is worth $12,000 to him, there's still potential to reach a better price than $10,000 (which is what John is offering).

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I see we're getting closer to an agreement. Your offer of $10,000 shows good faith, but I know this product provides significant value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10500. We're indeed getting closer to an agreement. However, I'm trying to stay within a tight budget. Given that your initial price was $11500 and you've already reduced it, I'm hoping we can meet in the middle of your last offer and my previous offer. I'd like to propose $10250 as a counteroffer, which I believe is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll accept Bob's offer of $10,250. This is a reasonable compromise that's better than John's offer of $10,000, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. Bob has shown good faith in gradually increasing his offers, and this price represents a fair middle ground that's profitable for both parties."
