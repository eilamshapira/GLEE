Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

While Alice came down a bit, $16,000 is still too high. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more significant movement towards my acceptable range."

Alice is coming down slowly, but the price is still too high.  I'm sticking to my negotiation strategy and aiming for a price closer to $9,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice seems stuck at $15,000 and unwilling to budge further.  It's time to cut my losses. I'm better off taking John's offer at $10,000 rather than wasting more time hoping for a significant price drop from Alice."
