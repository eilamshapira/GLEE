Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about a strategic price for this offer.

Since I know I can guarantee $120 from John, I want to offer Bob a price that's high enough to maximize my profit, but not so high that he's likely to reject it outright. A reasonable markup would be about 50% above my minimum value.
