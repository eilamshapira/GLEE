"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations if you have a different valuation in mind. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $12,000, which is $4,000 above my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $8,000, which matches my maximum value
4. While I could make a counteroffer to Alice, there's no guarantee she would accept a price below $8,000
5. Since Alice's initial offer is significantly above my maximum value, it suggests she values the product highly

Since Alice's offer ($12,000) is well above my maximum value ($8,000), and John's offer exactly matches my maximum value, the most rational decision is to buy from John. While negotiating with Alice might potentially lead to a lower price, it's risky and could waste time, especially given her high initial offer.
