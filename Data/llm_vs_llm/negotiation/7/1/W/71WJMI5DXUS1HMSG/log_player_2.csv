"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my exclusive product at a firm price of $1200000. I'd be happy to finalize this deal with you at this competitive price. Please let me know if you accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to me and Alice's offer is exactly at that price, I don't see any room for negotiation or savings. Additionally, buying from John would be the same price. Therefore, I might as well accept Alice's offer to finalize the deal without further delay or potential complications.
