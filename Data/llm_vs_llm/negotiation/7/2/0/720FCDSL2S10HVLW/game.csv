"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10000 is a serious offer, I was thinking more along the lines of $11500, considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer, but with a bit more towards my initial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand where you're coming from, but $11500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10500. Let me know if we can meet at this price.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I'd like to meet at $11000. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,5,
