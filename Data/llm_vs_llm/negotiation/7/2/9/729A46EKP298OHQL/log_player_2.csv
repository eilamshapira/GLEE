"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to analyze this offer carefully.

Alice is offering the product for $120, but it's only worth up to $80 to me. Paying $120 would mean I'm spending $40 more than the product's value to me, which doesn't make financial sense.

John (not Jhon as mentioned in the options) is willing to sell me the same product for $80, which is exactly what the product is worth to me.

The most economical choice is clear - I should buy from John.
