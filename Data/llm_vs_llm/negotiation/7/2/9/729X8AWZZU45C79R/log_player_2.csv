Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $500000, I'm afraid that's significantly below the product's actual value. I understand my initial price may have been high from your perspective, so I'm willing to come down to $1650000, which represents a substantial discount. This product has exceptional quality and features that justify this valuation. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate you raising your offer to $750000, which shows your interest in the product. However, I need to emphasize that this product is worth considerably more. I've already received an offer from another buyer for $1200000, which reflects its true market value. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $1400000, which is a fair price considering the product's quality and benefits. Does this work better for you?
