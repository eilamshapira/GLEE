"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer to purchase the product for a price that I believe is reasonable. I'll offer you $600000, and I'm open to negotiations.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600000 is significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This reflects the product's unique value and allows for a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price to $1200000. However, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to meet you halfway. I'll offer you $700000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700000 is still far below what this product is worth.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to offer a final compromise price of $900000.  This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the product's value. I'm open to hearing your final thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,5,
