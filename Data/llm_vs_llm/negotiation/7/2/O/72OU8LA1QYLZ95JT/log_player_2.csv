"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $200 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $120, and also higher than John's price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Since I can always buy from John for $120, there's no reason to accept any price higher than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}

I'll start with a relatively low offer of $80. This gives room for negotiation while still being a reasonable price. Since I know I can get it for $120 from John, I want to try to get a better deal from Alice. Starting low allows for potential back-and-forth negotiation while still leaving room to increase my offer if needed."
