Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, I have a few options.

Considering the product is worth at least $120 to me, and I can sell it to John for $120, accepting $90 from Bob is not a good option.

Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, let's analyze the options.

*   **Accept $100 from Bob:** This is better than my minimum value ($120), and better than accepting nothing from Bob, but less than I could potentially get.
*   **Reject and Counteroffer:** There's a risk Bob will walk away, but there's also a chance of getting more money.
*   **Sell to John for $120:** Guaranteed $120 profit.

At this point, I think it's best to secure a sale, but I still want to try for more.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, let's analyze the options.

*   **Accept $110 from Bob:** Less than selling to John, but still a profit.
*   **Reject and Counteroffer:** Risk of Bob walking away, potentially getting less.
*   **Sell to John for $120:** Guaranteed $120.

I still want more, and $110 is too close to what I know I can get. Let's risk one more round.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, let's analyze the options.

*   **Accept $115 from Bob:** Getting close to the minimum to me.
*   **Reject and Counteroffer:** Risky. Bob might leave at this point.
*   **Sell to John for $120:** Guaranteed $120.

The difference between $115 and $120 isn't huge. I've pushed Bob as far as I can. I'm going to go with the sure thing.
