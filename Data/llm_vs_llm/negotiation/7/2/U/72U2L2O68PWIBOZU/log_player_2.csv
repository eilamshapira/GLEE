"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer of $17,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000), it doesn't make sense to accept it. While I could make a counteroffer, given that Alice's initial price is so high and the product is worth $15,000 to her, it might be difficult to negotiate down to a price below $10,000. The safe and economical choice would be to buy from John.
