Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be very interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $25,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering my budget constraints.

# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $20000 is still a bit too high for me. Considering my initial offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you at $12000. I think this is a fair price that takes into account both of our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
