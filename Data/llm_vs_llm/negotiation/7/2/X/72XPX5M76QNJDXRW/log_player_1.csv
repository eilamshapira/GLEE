Send your offer to Bob.,"Since the product is worth $10,000 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price, I'll start with a high offer to Bob to see if I can maximize my profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $10,000, there's no reason for me to accept Bob's low offer. Furthermore, since I can always sell to John for $10,000, continuing negotiations with Bob when his opening counteroffer is so low might not be productive.
