# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer is the same as John's, so there's no benefit to accepting her offer. You can save time and potential hassle by going directly to John."
