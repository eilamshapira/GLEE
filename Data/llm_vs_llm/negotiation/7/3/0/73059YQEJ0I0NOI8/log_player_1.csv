Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Okay, considering my options:

*   **Accepting Bob's offer ($9,000):** This gives me a profit of $1,000.
*   **Selling to John ($8,000):** This gives me a profit of $0.
*   **Rejecting and Counteroffering:** This could potentially lead to a higher price, but risks losing the sale.

Since I know Bob values the product at $12,000, I think I can push a little higher.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Alright, let's analyze:

*   **Accepting Bob's offer ($9,500):** Profit of $1,500.
*   **Selling to John ($8,000):** Profit of $0.
*   **Rejecting and Counteroffering:** Risky, but potentially higher profit.

I'm still confident I can get a better deal than $9,500. I'll try one more counteroffer, but I'll keep John as a backup plan.
