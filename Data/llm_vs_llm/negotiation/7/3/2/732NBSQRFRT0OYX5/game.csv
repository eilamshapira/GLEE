"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that the product is unique and of high quality, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I believe this price reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you're willing to negotiate. However, I must say that $10000 is a bit lower than I was expecting. Considering the product's exceptional quality and potential benefits, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $22000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the product's true value.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $22000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $12000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, I still believe that $12000 is a bit below the product's true value. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $20000. This price is still a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's quality and potential benefits. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable price soon.",20000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $20000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $14000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal soon.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence in trying to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. Considering the product's value and the fact that I have another offer on the table, I'm willing to make a final compromise and offer it to you for $18000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's quality and potential benefits. If we can't agree on this price, I may need to consider other options.",18000.0,Alice,7,
