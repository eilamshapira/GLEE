Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,450,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in your product, I believe your asking price is quite high. The product is worth about $1200000 in the current market, and I'd be willing to pay $1250000 for it. This gives you a reasonable profit while still being a fair price for me. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to him. There's still room for negotiation to reach a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, I must respectfully disagree with your market assessment. This product has proven value and quality that justifies a higher price point. While I can be flexible from my initial offer, $1,250,000 is too low considering the product's true value. I can offer it for $1,375,000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial price and would still provide you with excellent value given the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1375000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for reducing your price. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still believe there's room for us to find a middle ground. I understand you value the product highly, but I need to ensure I'm making a sound investment as well. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1300000, which would give you a $100000 profit over your cost. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and represents a fair price considering the market conditions. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer. While Bob has increased his offer, which shows he's willing to negotiate, he still has significant room to increase his price given that the product is worth $1,500,000 to him. We're only in round 4 of 10, so there's still time to negotiate a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your point about finding middle ground. You're demonstrating good faith in the negotiation by raising your price, and I'll respond in kind with another reduction. However, I know the unique value this product brings to the table. Let's meet closer to the middle - I'm offering $1,340,000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial price and would still be a profitable investment for you. This price better reflects the true value of the product while showing my willingness to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1340000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to work toward an agreement. Your reduction shows good faith, and I want to continue in that spirit. I can see we're getting closer to finding common ground. I'm prepared to raise my offer to $1320000, which is a significant increase from my starting position. This gives you a healthy $120000 profit while still keeping the deal attractive for me. We're now only $20000 apart, and I hope we can find a resolution that satisfies both our interests. What do you say to meeting me at this price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,320,000. While we might be able to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal over a relatively small amount isn't worth it. This price gives me a good profit of $120,000 over my minimum price, and we've reached a reasonable middle ground. Additionally, we've used 6 rounds already, and pushing too hard might lead Bob to walk away, leaving me with only John's lower offer of $1,200,000."
