"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1450000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential return on investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll carefully consider Alice's offer. She's asking for $1,450,000, which is below my maximum value of $1,500,000, but only by $50,000. Since this is our first round of negotiation and I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, there's significant room to negotiate for a better price.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in your product, I believe your asking price is quite high. The product is worth about $1,200,000 in the current market, and I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This gives you a reasonable profit while still being a fair price for me. I look forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, I must respectfully disagree with your market assessment. This product has proven value and quality that justifies a higher price point. While I can be flexible from my initial offer, $1250000 is too low considering the product's true value. I can offer it for $1375000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial price and would still provide you with excellent value given the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has come down from her initial $1,450,000 to $1,375,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, there's still a significant gap between her offer and what I believe is a fair price based on her cost of $1,200,000. Since we're only in round 3 of 10 possible rounds, I'll continue negotiating for a better price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for reducing your price. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still believe there's room for us to find a middle ground. I understand you value the product highly, but I need to ensure I'm making a sound investment as well. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000, which would give you a $100,000 profit over your cost. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and represents a fair price considering the market conditions. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your point about finding middle ground. You're demonstrating good faith in the negotiation by raising your price, and I'll respond in kind with another reduction. However, I know the unique value this product brings to the table. Let's meet closer to the middle - I'm offering $1340000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial price and would still be a profitable investment for you. This price better reflects the true value of the product while showing my willingness to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,340,000.

She's moved down by $110,000 from her initial offer, while I've moved up by $50,000. We're making progress toward finding a middle ground. Since we still have 5 more potential rounds of negotiation, and there's still room for a better price compared to her cost of $1,200,000, I'll continue negotiating.

Your reduction shows good faith, and I want to continue in that spirit. I can see we're getting closer to finding common ground. I'm prepared to raise my offer to $1,320,000, which is a significant increase from my starting position. This gives you a healthy $120,000 profit while still keeping the deal attractive for me. We're now only $20,000 apart, and I hope we can find a resolution that satisfies both our interests. What do you say to meeting me at this price point?"", ""product_price"": 1320000}"
