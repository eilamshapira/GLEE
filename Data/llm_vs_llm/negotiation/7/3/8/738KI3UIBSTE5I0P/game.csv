"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're suggesting, my budget for this product is quite a bit lower. I can offer you $500000 for it. Let me know if we can make a deal at this price.",500000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $500000 is significantly below my expectations for this product. I am willing to consider a price of $1800000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1800000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're still apart on the price, but I believe this product's value justifies a higher investment. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. What are your thoughts on this?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you adjusting your price, but $1600000 is still over my limit. I'm willing to offer $700000. Hopefully, we can find some common ground closer to this.",700000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid, $700000 is still below what I can accept. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1400000 to try and meet you halfway. Let's see if we can close the gap further.",1400000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're getting closer, but we're not quite there yet. I'm willing to drop the price further to $1300000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope it brings us closer to a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I have to consider my budget constraints. I can increase my offer to $850000. I hope we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,6,
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. However, $850000 is still not within the range I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1250000, which is very close to my minimum threshold. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting very close to my bottom line. I can offer the product for $1225000. This is my final significant concession. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
