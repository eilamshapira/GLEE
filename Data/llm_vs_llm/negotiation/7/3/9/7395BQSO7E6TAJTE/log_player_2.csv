"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Since you are willing to pay $10,000 for the product, and John is offering it at that price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You can save time and effort by buying directly from John."
