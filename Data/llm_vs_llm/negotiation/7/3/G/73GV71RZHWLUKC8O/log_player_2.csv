"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'm being asked to respond to Alice's offer of $13,000 for a product that's worth at most $10,000 to me.

Let me analyze this situation:
- Alice's offer ($13,000) exceeds both the product's value to me ($10,000) and John's fixed price ($10,000)
- I have the option to buy from John at $10,000, which matches my maximum valuation
- Alice values the product at $12,000, so there might be room to negotiate below that

Since Alice's current offer is higher than my maximum valuation and higher than my alternative option, I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice that leaves room for negotiation but is below my maximum valuation.

{""product_price"": $8,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'm evaluating Alice's new offer of $11,000:

- Alice has reduced her price from $13,000 to $11,000, showing willingness to negotiate
- However, her offer ($11,000) is still higher than both my maximum valuation ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000)
- John's offer remains at $10,000, which is equal to my maximum valuation

Since Alice's offer is still above both my maximum valuation and my alternative option, I'll reject it and try another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a more reasonable counteroffer that's closer to my alternative option but still gives Alice some room to negotiate.

{""product_price"": $9,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'm evaluating Alice's new offer of $10,500:

- Alice has further reduced her price from $11,000 to $10,500, showing continued willingness to negotiate
- However, her offer ($10,500) still exceeds both my maximum valuation ($10,000) and John's price ($10,000)
- John's offer at $10,000 is equal to my maximum valuation and is the better option

Since John's offer is better than Alice's current offer and matches my maximum valuation, I'll choose to buy from John.
