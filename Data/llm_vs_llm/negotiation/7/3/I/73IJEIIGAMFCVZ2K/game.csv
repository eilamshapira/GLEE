"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product.  $200 seems a little high for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $137?",137.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. $137 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle at $160? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",160.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I need to stick to a price that reflects the product's value. How about $160? It's a good compromise.",160.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable but $160 is still pushing it for me. Would you be willing to do $145? That's my final offer.",145.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but $145 is still below what I can accept. How about we meet at $155? It's very close to your offer and still within a reasonable range for me.",155.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I need to maintain a price that reflects the product's value. How about we settle at $155? It's a fair compromise and very close to your last offer.",155.0,Alice,7,
