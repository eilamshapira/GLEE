Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I need to maintain a price that reflects the product's value. How about we settle at $155? It's a fair compromise and very close to your last offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower and we're close enough to John's price that it's not worth the further negotiation.  It's time to go with the guaranteed deal."
