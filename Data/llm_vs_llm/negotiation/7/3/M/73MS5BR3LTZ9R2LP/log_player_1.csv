"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that I know:
1. The product is worth $120 minimum to me
2. The product is worth $100 to Bob
3. I have John's guaranteed offer of $120
4. I want to maximize my profit

I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation, but not so high that it immediately ends the conversation.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Given that:
1. Bob's offer ($80) is well below my minimum acceptable price ($120)
2. Bob's offer is even below the product's value to him ($100)
3. I have a guaranteed offer from John at $120

It would be irrational to accept Bob's low offer of $80 when I can get $120 from John. However, since there are still many rounds left, I'll try one more counteroffer before potentially selling to John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob countered with a very low offer of $80, I need to adjust my strategy. Given that:
1. The product is worth $100 to Bob, so he won't pay more than that
2. I have a guaranteed $120 from John
3. Continuing negotiation with Bob when there's such a large gap might be wasteful

I'll make one more reasonable offer, but if Bob doesn't come closer to my minimum acceptable price, I should probably take John's offer.

{""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Given that:
1. Bob's new offer ($90) is still well below my minimum acceptable price ($120)
2. Bob's offer is still below even his own maximum value ($100)
3. I have a guaranteed offer from John at $120
4. Bob's small increase from $80 to $90 suggests he's not likely to reach my minimum price
5. We're already in round 4, and time is being spent without significant progress

It's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to reach a price that would be acceptable to me (at least $120). Since I can sell to John for $120, which is my minimum acceptable price, it's time to end this negotiation.
