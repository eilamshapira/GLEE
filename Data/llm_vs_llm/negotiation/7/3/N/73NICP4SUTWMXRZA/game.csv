"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's quite a bit higher than I was expecting. I'm looking to spend no more than $600000 for the product. Could we start there?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $600000 is too low for the value this product brings. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? I'm willing to offer you the product for $2000000, which is a great deal considering its market value.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Alice, but $2000000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could we settle for $800000? This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. I'm eager to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
