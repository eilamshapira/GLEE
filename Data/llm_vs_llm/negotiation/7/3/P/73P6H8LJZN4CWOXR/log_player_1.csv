Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Considering I can get a similar product elsewhere for $80, I'm willing to purchase yours for $70. Does that work for you?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
