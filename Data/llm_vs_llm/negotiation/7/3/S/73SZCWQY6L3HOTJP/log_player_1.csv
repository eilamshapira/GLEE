Send your offer to Bob.,"Given the situation:
1. The product is worth $10,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000
3. The product is worth at least $12,000 to me

Since I already have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 (John), and Bob values the product at only $10,000, there's no point in offering Bob a price below $12,000. Bob won't accept any price above $10,000 since that would be more than the product's worth to him. Therefore, I'll offer Bob the price of $12,000, knowing he'll likely reject it, and I can then sell to John for the same amount.
