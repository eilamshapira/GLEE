"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $2500000 is beyond my budget. I am willing to pay up to $1000000 for the product, considering its value to me. Please let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is the absolute minimum value of this product to me. Given its unique qualities and market potential, I believe a fair middle ground would be $1750000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value. Would you consider this price?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. While I understand the value you place on the product, $1750000 is still above what I can justify spending. I am willing to increase my offer to $1100000, which is close to my maximum budget. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
