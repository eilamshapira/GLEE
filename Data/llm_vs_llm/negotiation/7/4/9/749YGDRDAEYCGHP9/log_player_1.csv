Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. 

I know that:
1. The product is worth at least $150 to me
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer of $150 from John
3. Bob's valuation is unknown, but he might value it higher than $150

Since I have nothing to lose (given John's guaranteed offer), I can try to get a higher price from Bob. I'll set a price significantly above my minimum to maximize my potential profit, but not so high that it would seem unreasonable.
