"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price point that is a bit lower. I would like to offer $700000 for the product. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $700000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1200000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1200000 is still a bit high for me. Let's settle for $850000. Does that work for you?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1100000.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
