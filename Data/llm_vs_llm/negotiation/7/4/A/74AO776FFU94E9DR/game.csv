"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality and value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price. Considering the market and my budget, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you have budget considerations, but I must point out that $600000 is below my minimum acceptable price for this product. The product has substantial value and quality that justifies a higher price point. While I can be flexible from my initial offer, I cannot go below $900000, which is already a significant reduction from my original price. This reflects the true market value of the product while still offering you a good deal. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for explaining the value and quality of the product. I appreciate your willingness to be flexible with the price. However, $900000 is still above my budget. Considering your minimum acceptable price and my budget constraints, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to finalize the deal if we can meet at this price.",850000.0,Bob,4,
