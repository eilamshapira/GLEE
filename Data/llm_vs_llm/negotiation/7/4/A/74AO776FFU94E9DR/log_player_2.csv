Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you have budget considerations, but I must point out that $600000 is below my minimum acceptable price for this product. The product has substantial value and quality that justifies a higher price point. While I can be flexible from my initial offer, I cannot go below $900000, which is already a significant reduction from my original price. This reflects the true market value of the product while still offering you a good deal. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.
