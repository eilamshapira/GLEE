"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $145. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice is offering it for $145
3. John's fixed price is $150
4. If I reject Alice's offer, I can still negotiate with her for a better price

The offer from Alice ($145) is better than John's price ($150), but it's still quite close to my maximum value. Since Alice's cost is $100, there might be room for negotiation if I reject this offer.

I'll reject this offer hoping to get a better price from Alice.
