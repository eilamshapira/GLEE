"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Considering my options:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer:** This gives me the minimum I'm willing to accept, but it's a sure sale.
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer:** I could potentially get a higher price, but I risk losing the deal entirely.
*   **(3) Sell the product to John:** This guarantees me $100.

Since I need to make at least $100, accepting Bob's offer is not a bad idea and it's the safest path. However, I will reject Bob's offer, because I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer for Round 3:

{""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Analyzing my options:

*   **(1) Accept Bob's offer:** This secures a sale for $120, which is more than my minimum of $100 and better than selling to John.
*   **(2) Reject Bob's offer:** I might get a higher price but risk losing the deal.
*   **(3) Sell the product to John:** This gives me $100.

Given that I'm now offered more than my minimum, I'm going to accept.
