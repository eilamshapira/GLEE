"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this strategically. 
Alice's offer is $150, which is exactly the same as John's price and my maximum valuation. There's no benefit in accepting this offer immediately since:
1. It's not saving me any money compared to buying from John
2. By negotiating with Alice, I might be able to get a better price
3. I can always fall back to John's $150 offer if the negotiation with Alice doesn't go well

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice offered $150, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay, I should start with a significantly lower offer to leave room for negotiation. A common negotiation strategy is to start around 60-70% of the maximum price. I'll start with $100, which gives room for back-and-forth negotiation while still being a reasonable opening counteroffer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","This is a good development! Alice has lowered her price from $150 to $140, showing willingness to negotiate and already offering $10 less than John's price. However, since she came down $50 from her initial offer after my $100 counteroffer, there might still be room for negotiation. That said, $140 is already a good price as it saves me $10 compared to John's offer.

At this point, I could:
1. Accept the $140 offer, guaranteeing a $10 saving
2. Try to negotiate further, risking that Alice might increase her price again
3. Buy from John, but this makes no sense as Alice's offer is better

Since we still have several rounds left and Alice has shown significant flexibility in price, I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer. The worst case is that I can always come back to John's $150 offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved from $150 to $140, and I previously offered $100, I'll try to meet closer to the middle but still leaving room for negotiation. I'll increase my previous offer by $20, which shows I'm willing to move up but still trying to get a better deal.
