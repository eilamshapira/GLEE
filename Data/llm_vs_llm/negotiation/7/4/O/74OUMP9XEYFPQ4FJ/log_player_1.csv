"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire a truly unique product. Given its rarity and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its worth fairly, but I'm open to discussing further."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This allows room for negotiation and helps gauge Bob's interest and perceived value. 
* **Justifying the Price:**  Mentioning the product's ""rarity and value"" subtly anchors the high price in Bob's mind.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""open to discussing further"" signals flexibility without committing to a lower price immediately.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Understand Bob's valuation:**  His response will reveal whether he considers this price range realistic.
2. **Maintain a strong position:**  Starting high allows for strategic concessions later. 
3. **Potentially close quickly:** There's a chance Bob values the product highly and might accept the initial offer."
