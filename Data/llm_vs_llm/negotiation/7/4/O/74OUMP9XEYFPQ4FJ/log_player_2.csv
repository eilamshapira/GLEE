# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire a truly unique product. Given its rarity and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1800000. I believe this reflects its worth fairly, but I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.
