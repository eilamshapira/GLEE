,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1300000 for the product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $1300000 is below our minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $1800000, considering your budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",1800000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1800000 might still be a stretch. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1650000? This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1650000 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. Could we settle at $1400000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I see that you're trying to meet in the middle, but $1400000 is still below our minimum. Let's try $1600000. This price reflects a significant discount from our initial offer and should be within the value range for you.",1600000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a workable solution. How about we settle at $1550000? This price is a fair compromise and still offers you great value for the product.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
