"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's a high-quality item that I'm offering for $8000. This is a fair market price for this product, and I believe it provides excellent value at this price point. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth $8,000 to me (maximum I'm willing to pay)
2. Alice is offering it for $8,000
3. John is selling it for $8,000

Since all prices are identical ($8,000), and I need the product, I can accept any offer. There's no price advantage between the options. In such cases, it's generally better to accept the first reasonable offer rather than prolonging the negotiation process.
