Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer is $800,000, which is exactly my minimum acceptable value for the product, and also exactly the same as John's standing offer, I'll try to negotiate for a better price with Bob before considering selling to either one of them.
