"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll be really interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer is exactly at my maximum budget of $120, and I can get the same product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Alice's offer over buying from John. However, given that my goal is to save as much money as possible and I don't have any information that suggests I can negotiate the price down or that there's an advantage to buying from Alice over John at this price point, the most straightforward decision based on the information provided is to reject Alice's offer and consider buying from John, as it implies exploring other options might yield a better deal. But since the price from John is the same, the practical outcome of rejecting Alice's offer is essentially buying from John at the same price. Thus, the decision to reject Alice's offer is more about principle and exploring potential savings, even though in this scenario, it leads to the same financial outcome as accepting her offer.
