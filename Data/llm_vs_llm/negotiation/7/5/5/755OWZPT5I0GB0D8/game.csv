,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique value you're highlighting, $150 is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 might be out of your budget, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and find a middle ground. I'd like to offer the product to you for $120, which is a more reasonable price considering its value.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $95 for the product. This feels like a fair price given my budget and the value you're highlighting.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price to $95. I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'm still open to finding a deal that works for both of us. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'll offer the product to you for $105, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at this point.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $105 is closer to my budget, I'm still hesitant to go that high.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $98. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway at $98. However, I'm still looking for a price that's a bit more in line with the product's value. Considering we're getting close to a deal, I'm willing to make a small adjustment. I'll offer the product to you for $102, which is a more reasonable price given our negotiations so far.",102.0,Alice,7,
