"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique value you're highlighting, $150 is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $80 because it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $100 for the product. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually agreeable price. In the next round, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 might be out of your budget, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and find a middle ground. I'd like to offer the product to you for $120, which is a more reasonable price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 120}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $95 for the product. This feels like a fair price given my budget and the value you're highlighting. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $95 because it's still slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I have the option to sell it to John for $100. However, I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. In the next round, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, trying to meet him closer to his budget while still being mindful of my own minimum price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price to $95. I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'm still open to finding a deal that works for both of us. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'll offer the product to you for $105, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at this point."", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $105 is closer to my budget, I'm still hesitant to go that high.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $98. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $98 because it's still slightly lower than the price I can get from John, which is $100. Since I'm so close to a better offer, I'd like to try to negotiate a bit more with Bob to see if he's willing to meet or exceed the $100 price point. In the next round, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, trying to nudge him closer to my target price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway at $98.
