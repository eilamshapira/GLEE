Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $15,000. This is a competitive price for the value it provides. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value, but I'm looking to save a bit more on the purchase. Would you consider lowering the price to $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Reasoning (not part of response): I'll accept Bob's offer of $12,000 because:
1. It's $2,000 more than John's guaranteed offer of $10,000
2. Bob's offer represents a reasonable middle ground between my initial ask of $15,000 and my minimum acceptable price of $10,000
3. Continuing negotiations might risk losing Bob as a buyer, and there's no guarantee of getting a better price
4. The offer is fair and allows both parties to benefit from the transaction"
