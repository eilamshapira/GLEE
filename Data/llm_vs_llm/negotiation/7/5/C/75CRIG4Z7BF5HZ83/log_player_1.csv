Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $18,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000 if I need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low. $8,000 is significantly less than my minimum of $12,000. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm countering with $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach an agreement. I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000. This is a safe option that guarantees me a decent profit, and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
