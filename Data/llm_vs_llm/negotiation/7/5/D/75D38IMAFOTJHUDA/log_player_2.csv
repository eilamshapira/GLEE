"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is offering the product at her own valuation. There's no discount, and since I can buy it for the same price from John, I'll reject her offer and see if she counters with a lower price."
