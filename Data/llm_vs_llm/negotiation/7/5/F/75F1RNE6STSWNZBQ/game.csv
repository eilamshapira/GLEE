"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me at the moment. Considering my budget, I'm willing to pay $600000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price reflecting the value I perceive and my current financial constraints.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $600000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure a fair return on this high-quality product. I can reduce my initial price to $1000000, which represents a substantial discount from my first offer. This price better reflects the true market value and quality of the product. Would you consider this revised offer?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the new offer. However, my maximum budget is $800000. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
