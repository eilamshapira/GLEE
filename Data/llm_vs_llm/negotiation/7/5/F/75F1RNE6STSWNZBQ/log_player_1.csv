"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,200,000. This is a competitive price for the product's capabilities and potential return on investment. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me at the moment. Considering my budget, I'm willing to pay $600000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price reflecting the value I perceive and my current financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round since Bob's offer of $600,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. However, I'll reduce my initial asking price to show flexibility in the negotiation while maintaining a profitable margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $600,000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure a fair return on this high-quality product. I can reduce my initial price to $1,000,000, which represents a substantial discount from my first offer. This price better reflects the true market value and quality of the product. Would you consider this revised offer?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the new offer. However, my maximum budget is $800000. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob has indicated that his maximum budget is $800,000 and his current offer of $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and he's stated this is his final offer, it makes the most sense to take John's guaranteed offer of $800,000 rather than continue negotiations that likely won't exceed this amount."
