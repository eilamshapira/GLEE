"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I see that Alice is offering me the product for $13,000, but the product is only worth $12,000 to me. Since John is willing to sell me the same product for $12,000, which matches the maximum value I'm willing to pay, it makes more sense for me to buy from John rather than accept Alice's higher price.
