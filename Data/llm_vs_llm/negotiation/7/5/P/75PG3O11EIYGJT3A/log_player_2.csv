"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. Let me know if you'd like to proceed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer is $1,500,000, which is the value of the product to her, but this far exceeds the maximum value of $800,000 that I'm willing to pay for the product. John is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $800,000, which is the maximum I value the product at.

Since Alice's asking price is much higher than my maximum value, and equal to another readily available option, the rational choice is to purchase from John instead.
