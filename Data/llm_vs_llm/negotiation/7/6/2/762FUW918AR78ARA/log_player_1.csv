Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation as Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  This allows for a potential win-win scenario where you can earn a good profit while Bob still gets a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it is still below my desired profit margin. I believe I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my previous offer slightly to $1,000,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable outcome. This price is a good middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and it should encourage him to accept."
