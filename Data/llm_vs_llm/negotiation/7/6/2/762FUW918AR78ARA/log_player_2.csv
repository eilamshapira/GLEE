"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is close to the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000), but still slightly below it, and considering that the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer could potentially lead to a better deal. Therefore, the best course of action at this point is to reject Alice's offer and proceed with making a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, and I'm looking to save as much money as possible while still being willing to pay up to $1,200,000, a reasonable counteroffer would be to meet somewhere in the middle but slightly favoring my side since I have the option to buy from John for $1,200,000. A strategic approach would be to start with a lower offer to leave room for further negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given that Alice has rejected my previous counteroffer and come back with a new offer of $1,000,000, it indicates she is willing to negotiate further and is moving closer to a mutually beneficial price. Since $1,000,000 is below my maximum willingness to pay ($1,200,000) and significantly above what the product is worth to Alice ($800,000), this offer seems reasonable.

Accepting this offer would save me $200,000 compared to buying from John, which is a substantial savings. Additionally, continuing to negotiate could risk Alice pulling out of the deal or not being willing to go lower, given that she has already come down significantly from her initial offer.

Therefore, the best decision at this point is to accept Alice's offer of $1,000,000.
