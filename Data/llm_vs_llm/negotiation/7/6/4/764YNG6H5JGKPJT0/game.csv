Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $20000 for it. Let me know what you think!,20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $15000. I would prefer to do business with you, but I can't justify paying more than the product is worth to me. I can offer you $12000 for the product. This gives you a reasonable profit while also giving me a reason to choose you over John.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I can't go as low as $12000. How about we meet halfway at $16000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. Your offer of $16000 is getting closer, but I still can't accept it. As I mentioned, John is offering the same product for $15000, so there's no incentive for me to pay more than that. In fact, for me to choose you over John, I would need to pay less. I can offer you $14000, which still gives you a reasonable profit while providing me with an incentive to buy from you instead of John. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued interest, Bob. While I understand your position, I canâ€™t go as low as $14000. How about we settle on $15500? This way, both of us will benefit without any substantial differences compared to John's offer. Let me know if that works for you!",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your effort to come down on the price. However, I still can't justify paying $15500 when John is offering the exact same product for $15000. There needs to be a clear advantage for me to choose you over John. I'm willing to pay $14500, which is still a fair price that gives you a profit while also giving me a small financial incentive to choose you as my seller. If we can't agree on a price that's at least slightly better than John's offer, I'll have to go with him instead.",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued offers, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but I can't accept $14500. How about we split the difference between my previous offer and yours? I'm willing to sell it for $15000. This matches John's offer, but you'll be getting it from me. Let me know if this works for you!",15000.0,Alice,7,
