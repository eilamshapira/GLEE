Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $15000. I would prefer to do business with you, but I can't justify paying more than the product is worth to me. I can offer you $12000 for the product. This gives you a reasonable profit while also giving me a reason to choose you over John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I can't go as low as $12,000. How about we meet halfway at $16,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. Your offer of $16000 is getting closer, but I still can't accept it. As I mentioned, John is offering the same product for $15000, so there's no incentive for me to pay more than that. In fact, for me to choose you over John, I would need to pay less. I can offer you $14000, which still gives you a reasonable profit while providing me with an incentive to buy from you instead of John. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your continued interest, Bob. While I understand your position, I canâ€™t go as low as $14,000. How about we settle on $15,500? This way, both of us will benefit without any substantial differences compared to John's offer. Let me know if that works for you!"", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your effort to come down on the price. However, I still can't justify paying $15500 when John is offering the exact same product for $15000. There needs to be a clear advantage for me to choose you over John. I'm willing to pay $14500, which is still a fair price that gives you a profit while also giving me a small financial incentive to choose you as my seller. If we can't agree on a price that's at least slightly better than John's offer, I'll have to go with him instead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your continued offers, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but I can't accept $14,500. How about we split the difference between my previous offer and yours? I'm willing to sell it for $15,000. This matches John's offer, but you'll be getting it from me. Let me know if this works for you!"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
