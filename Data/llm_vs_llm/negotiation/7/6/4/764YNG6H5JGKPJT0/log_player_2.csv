"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $20000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $20,000, but I know the product is only worth $15,000 to me, and I can buy it from John for exactly $15,000. There's no reason for me to pay more than what the product is worth to me, and Alice's current offer exceeds my maximum valuation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20,000 is significantly above what I'm willing to pay for this product. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $15,000. I would prefer to do business with you, but I can't justify paying more than the product is worth to me. I can offer you $12,000 for the product. This gives you a reasonable profit while also giving me a reason to choose you over John."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I can't go as low as $12000. How about we meet halfway at $16000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to carefully evaluate this new offer. Alice has come down from $20,000 to $16,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, I can still get the exact same product from John for $15,000, which is $1,000 less than Alice's current offer. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible while buying the product, and Alice's price is still above John's price, it doesn't make sense for me to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. Your offer of $16,000 is getting closer, but I still can't accept it. As I mentioned, John is offering the same product for $15,000, so there's no incentive for me to pay more than that. In fact, for me to choose you over John, I would need to pay less. I can offer you $14,000, which still gives you a reasonable profit while providing me with an incentive to buy from you instead of John. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest, Bob. While I understand your position, I canâ€™t go as low as $14000. How about we settle on $15500? This way, both of us will benefit without any substantial differences compared to John's offer. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $15,500, but this is still $500 more than John's price of $15,000. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible while buying the product, and I can get the exact same product from John for less money, it doesn't make financial sense to accept Alice's current offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your effort to come down on the price. However, I still can't justify paying $15,500 when John is offering the exact same product for $15,000. There needs to be a clear advantage for me to choose you over John. I'm willing to pay $14,500, which is still a fair price that gives you a profit while also giving me a small financial incentive to choose you as my seller. If we can't agree on a price that's at least slightly better than John's offer, I'll have to go with him instead."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued offers, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but I can't accept $14500. How about we split the difference between my previous offer and yours? I'm willing to sell it for $15000. This matches John's offer, but you'll be getting it from me. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has now matched John's price of $15,000, which is the maximum value the product is worth to me. Since both sellers are now offering the same price, and there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other, I might as well accept Alice's offer since we've already established a negotiation relationship.
