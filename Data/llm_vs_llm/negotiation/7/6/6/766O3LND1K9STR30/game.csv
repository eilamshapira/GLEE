,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. However, I believe the price of $18000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. I'd be willing to pay that for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $6000 is significantly below the product's value. I can lower my initial price to $16000, which is a considerable reduction. This is a high-quality product that's worth every penny.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer and for lowering the price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to offer $7000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
