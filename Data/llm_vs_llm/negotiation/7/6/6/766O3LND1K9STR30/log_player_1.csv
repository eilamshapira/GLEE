Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its features and worth."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. However, I believe the price of $18000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. I'd be willing to pay that for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. $6,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, so I cannot accept that offer. However, I'll try one more negotiation round before considering John's offer.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $6,000 is significantly below the product's value. I can lower my initial price to $16,000, which is a considerable reduction. This is a high-quality product that's worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer and for lowering the price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to offer $7000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $7,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and his increase from $6,000 to $7,000 suggests he's not likely to reach my minimum price, I'll take John's guaranteed offer of $15,000. This ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price and avoid further negotiation time."
