"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $20,000 is actually higher than the maximum value of $15,000 that the product is worth to you, and it's also higher than John's fixed price of $15,000, it doesn't make economic sense to accept this offer. I should either make a counteroffer or buy from John.

Given that John is willing to sell the product for $15,000 (which is exactly the maximum I'm willing to pay), it would be more efficient to simply buy from John rather than engage in potentially lengthy negotiations with Alice, especially when her initial offer is so much higher than the product's value to me.
