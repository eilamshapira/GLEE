"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I think a fair price would be $120, considering the value I'll get from it.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth more than $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. How about we settle at $180? I think this price reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $180 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new offer. How about we settle at $150? I think this price is a fair deal for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
