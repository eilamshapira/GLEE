"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $200, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I think a fair price would be $120, considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth more than $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. How about we settle at $180? I think this price reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $180 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new offer. How about we settle at $150? I think this price is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $150 matches my minimum acceptable price and is the same price I can get from selling to John, I'll accept the offer and close the deal."
