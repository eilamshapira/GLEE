"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this exclusive product at a price of $15000. It's a valuable investment and worth considering for your collection or business needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Based on the information provided, I'll analyze the situation:

- The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me (Bob)
- Alice is offering to sell it for $15,000
- John is willing to sell the same product for $10,000
- My goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible

Since Alice's offer ($15,000) exceeds both the product's value to me and John's price, the rational decision is to buy from John instead.
