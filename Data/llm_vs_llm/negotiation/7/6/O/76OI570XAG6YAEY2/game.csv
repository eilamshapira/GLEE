"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a product that I believe would be quite valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it for $135. This is a fair price considering the value it provides.",135.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $135 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $110. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'll get from the product.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget considerations, $110 is too low for this item considering its true value. I can come down to $130, which I believe is still a good deal for a product that would be worth $150 to the right buyer.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $130. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $120. I believe this is a fair compromise between our two prices.",120.0,Bob,4,
