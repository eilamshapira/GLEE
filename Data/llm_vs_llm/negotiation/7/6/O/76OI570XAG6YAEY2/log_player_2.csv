Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget considerations, $110 is too low for this item considering its true value. I can come down to $130, which I believe is still a good deal for a product that would be worth $150 to the right buyer.
