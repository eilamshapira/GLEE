"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe the product is valuable, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this price.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is too low for this product's value. I know the product is worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. I can offer it for $90, which would still give you a good value.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming back with a revised price of $90. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $75, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",75.0,Bob,4,
