"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I know would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at $95, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe the product is valuable, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $60 is too low as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is too low for this product's value. I know the product is worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. I can offer it for $90, which would still give you a good value."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming back with a revised price of $90. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $75, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $75 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80, and John is willing to pay $80, I'll sell to John. There's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer sufficiently in future rounds, and I can secure a guaranteed acceptable price now."
