"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I know would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at $95, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice's initial offer of $95 is close to my maximum budget, I'll consider my options carefully. However, I believe I can negotiate a better price. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, hoping to anchor the negotiation at a lower price point. Since I don't know Alice's reservation price (the minimum price she's willing to accept), I'll start with a relatively low offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe the product is valuable, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this price."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is too low for this product's value. I know the product is worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. I can offer it for $90, which would still give you a good value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $90 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's a step in the right direction. Since I know the product is worth $80 to Alice, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to meet her halfway between my previous offer and her new offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to find a middle ground between my previous offer of $60 and Alice's new offer of $90. A reasonable counteroffer would be around $75, which is still below my maximum budget of $100 and takes into account Alice's previous offers.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming back with a revised price of $90. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $75, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 75}"
