"Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I believe the product is valuable, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Considering the market value and potential, I think this is a fair price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'd like to start with this offer.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand you're looking for a better price than my initial offer, so I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This represents a $100000 reduction from my first offer and still provides you with $200000 in potential value, making it a win-win situation for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for reducing the price to $1300000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1150000. This price still reflects the product's value and potential, while also considering my budget constraints. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
