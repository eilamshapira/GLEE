"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its market value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and future potential."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I believe the product is valuable, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Considering the market value and potential, I think this is a fair price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'd like to start with this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is too low, as it's the same as John's guaranteed offer and equals my minimum acceptable price. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, there's room for negotiation to reach a price that's beneficial for both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand you're looking for a better price than my initial offer, so I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This represents a $100,000 reduction from my first offer and still provides you with $200,000 in potential value, making it a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for reducing the price to $1300000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1150000. This price still reflects the product's value and potential, while also considering my budget constraints. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,150,000. This is a reasonable compromise as it's significantly better than John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000, and while it's less than my initial asking price, it still provides a good profit margin. Given that we're already in round 4 and the risk of losing the deal increases with each round, accepting this offer is a prudent decision."
