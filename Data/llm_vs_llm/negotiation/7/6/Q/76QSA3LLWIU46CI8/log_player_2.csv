"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Considering its value and significance, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. I can either negotiate with Alice or buy from John. Given that Alice's initial offer is significantly above my maximum value, and there's no guarantee she'll lower it enough, the safest option is to buy from John.
