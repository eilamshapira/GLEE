"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I'm looking to stay well under my budget of $15000. I can see that John is offering the same product at $15000, but I'd prefer to purchase from you if we can agree on a better price. Would you consider $10000 for the product? This would allow me to save some funds while still giving you a good sale.",10000.0,Bob,2,
