"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I'm looking to stay well under my budget of $15000. I can see that John is offering the same product at $15000, but I'd prefer to purchase from you if we can agree on a better price. Would you consider $10000 for the product? This would allow me to save some funds while still giving you a good sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
