"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is exactly the maximum amount I'm willing to pay and exactly the same as John's price. Since I can't save any money by accepting this offer compared to buying from John, and there's potential to negotiate a lower price with Alice, it makes sense to reject and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I'm looking to stay well under my budget of $15,000. I can see that John is offering the same product at $15,000, but I'd prefer to purchase from you if we can agree on a better price. Would you consider $10,000 for the product? This would allow me to save some funds while still giving you a good sale."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
