"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is quite high (close to John's price of $15,000) and we know the product is only worth $8,000 to her, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. There's room for negotiation since we have 10 rounds, and the worst case is still buying from John at $15,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice started very high at $14,000 and the product is worth $8,000 to her, I'll make a low initial counteroffer to leave room for negotiation. I'll start at $9,000, which gives her a small profit but is much more reasonable than her initial offer.

{""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her price significantly from $14,000 to $12,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, there's still room for a better deal since we know her cost is $8,000. We still have 7 more rounds for negotiation, and John's offer of $15,000 remains as our backup. I'll reject this offer and try another counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice came down from $14,000 to $12,500, showing she's willing to negotiate. I'll increase my previous offer to show good faith but still maintain room for negotiation. I'll offer $10,500, which would give her a decent profit while being significantly better than her current offer.

{""product_price"": 10500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice is gradually reducing her price ($14,000 → $12,500 → $12,000), but the decrements are getting smaller. We still have 5 rounds left, and $12,000 is still significantly above her cost of $8,000. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer to try to meet at a more middle ground.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll continue the negotiation by increasing my offer to show willingness to compromise. Since Alice's last offer was $12,000 and my last offer was $10,500, I'll offer $11,000, which splits the difference a bit and still gives her a good profit margin above her $8,000 cost.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down to $11,750, which is a significant improvement from her initial $14,000. While we could continue negotiating, we only have 3 rounds left, and the gap between our positions is getting smaller. This price is significantly better than John's $15,000 offer, and there's risk in pushing too hard with limited rounds remaining. I'll accept this offer.
