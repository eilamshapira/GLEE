"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120. It's still a great deal for a product of this quality, and I think it's fair considering your initial offer. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $120. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $90. It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're open to it.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $90 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can finalize this.",105.0,Alice,5,
