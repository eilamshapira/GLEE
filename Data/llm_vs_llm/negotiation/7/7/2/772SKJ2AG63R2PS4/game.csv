"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I agree it's unique. However, the price you've offered is above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase this product, but I need a more reasonable price. I'm offering $800000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're working with a budget. While $800000 is lower than I can accept, I am willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle a bit? I'll come down to $1700000.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $1700000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your new price. I'll offer $1250000, which I believe is a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
