"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $190 is much too high for me. I know the market value of this product, and I can get it elsewhere for much less. I'm willing to offer $70 for it.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $70 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find middle ground, Alice, but $180 is still far beyond what I can pay for this product. I know I can get this item elsewhere for $80. To be fair, I could go up to $75 for your product, but anything higher than that simply doesn't work for my budget.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I also need to make a fair profit. Considering the product's value, the lowest I can go is $170. How does that sound?",170.0,Alice,5,
