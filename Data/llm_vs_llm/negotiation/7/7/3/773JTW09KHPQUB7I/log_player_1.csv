"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'll love it. How about I offer it to you for $190?"", ""product_price"": 190}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $190 is much too high for me. I know the market value of this product, and I can get it elsewhere for much less. I'm willing to offer $70 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $70. I have to at least get $150, and I want to make more.

My decision is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $70 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $180."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to find middle ground, Alice, but $180 is still far beyond what I can pay for this product. I know I can get this item elsewhere for $80. To be fair, I could go up to $75 for your product, but anything higher than that simply doesn't work for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob is lowballing me. His offer of $75 is unacceptable. I'm starting to feel like this is a waste of time, and I need to consider my options. I could sell to John for $150 right now.

My decision is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer, trying to sound more reasonable but still aiming for a decent profit:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I also need to make a fair profit. Considering the product's value, the lowest I can go is $170. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 170}"
