"Alice, while I appreciate the value of the product, your initial offer is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000, considering the market and my financial constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $800000 is significantly below the product's inherent value. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but not that far. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1250000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value and my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate you coming up to $900000. However, I'm hesitant to go much lower. My absolute lowest is $1100000. This is my final offer to you; otherwise, I will have to sell it to another buyer for $1000000.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
