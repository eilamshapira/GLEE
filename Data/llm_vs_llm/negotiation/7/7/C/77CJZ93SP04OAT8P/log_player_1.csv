Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to choose a price that maximizes my expected profit. The product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I have John as a guaranteed backup buyer at that price.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I need to set a price that gives me a reasonable chance of making more than my guaranteed $1,200,000, without being so high that Bob will almost certainly reject it.

I'll offer a price that represents a significant premium over my minimum acceptable value:

{""product_price"": 1,800,000}"
