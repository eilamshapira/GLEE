"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $10000 is quite high for me, especially since I can find similar products for less. I value the product at around $6000, which I think is a fair starting point. Would you consider this offer?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $8500. This is a fair price considering the value and quality of this product. Let's try to meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. While $8500 is better, it's still more than I was hoping to spend. I can increase my offer to $7000, which I think is a reasonable compromise. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer, just as you've shown flexibility by reducing yours.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position and I'm trying to be as accommodating as possible.  $7000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $7500. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?",7500.0,Alice,5,
