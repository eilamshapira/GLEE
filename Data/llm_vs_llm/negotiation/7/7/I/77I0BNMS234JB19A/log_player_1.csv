Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $10000 is quite high for me, especially since I can find similar products for less. I value the product at around $6000, which I think is a fair starting point. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value and quality of this product. Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. While $8500 is better, it's still more than I was hoping to spend. I can increase my offer to $7000, which I think is a reasonable compromise. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer, just as you've shown flexibility by reducing yours. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.
