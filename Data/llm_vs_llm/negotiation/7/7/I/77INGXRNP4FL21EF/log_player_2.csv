"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to finally offer you this incredible product. Given its immense value to you and the market, my initial offer is $950000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between its worth to you and my bottom line. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $950,000 and I want to save as much money as possible, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower, but still reasonable. Considering the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I'll aim for a price that is closer to that value, but also taking into account that I'm willing to pay up to $1,000,000.

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I understand the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between its worth to you and my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back to the table. While I understand your budget, $700000 is lower than my acceptable price. How about we meet in the middle a bit more? I'm willing to come down to $900000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and I believe truly reflects the exceptional value this product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice rejected my previous offer of $700,000 and came back with a counteroffer of $900,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer and her current offer. This would put the price at $800,000, which is actually the value the product holds for Alice. I believe this is a fair price, considering it's the minimum Alice is willing to accept, and it's still below my maximum budget of $1,000,000.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering your last offer was $900,000, I'm willing to meet you at $800,000. This price seems to reflect the product's true value to you, and it's a compromise I'm comfortable with. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
