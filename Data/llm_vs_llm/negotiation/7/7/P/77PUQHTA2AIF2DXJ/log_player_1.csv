Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer since Bob values the product at $150, but leave some room for negotiation if needed.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $100 is significantly above my minimum ($80) but still leaves quite a bit of room from his maximum value ($150), I'll reject and make a counteroffer. We can likely find a middle ground that's more favorable to me.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still maintain a strong position, aiming for a middle ground between his $100 offer and my initial $130.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","$110 is a reasonable offer - it's significantly better than my fallback option with John ($80), and while we might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk of Bob walking away. The current offer gives me a good profit, so I'll accept it.
