"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Since Alice is offering the product for $10,000, which is your maximum budget, there's no benefit to accepting her offer. You can get the product for the same price from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer."
