"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to analyze this offer carefully. Alice's offer is $1,000,000, which is exactly the same as what I can get from John, and it's also the maximum amount the product is worth to me. This gives me no surplus value.

Since Alice's product is worth $800,000 to her, there's room for negotiation between $800,000 and $1,000,000 where we could both benefit. By making a counteroffer, I might be able to secure a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice and up to $1,000,000 to me, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that leaves some room for negotiation but still gives us both some benefit. I'll start with a price that's slightly above Alice's valuation but significantly below my maximum.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I see that Alice has countered with $900,000, which is better than the initial $1,000,000 offer. This is a significant improvement and would save me $100,000 compared to buying from John.

Since Alice's product is worth $800,000 to her, she would still be making a $100,000 profit at this price. While I could continue negotiating to try to get a better price, there's a risk Alice might not go much lower, and the current offer already gives me $100,000 in savings compared to my alternative.

This seems like a reasonable compromise where we both benefit, so I'll accept this offer.
