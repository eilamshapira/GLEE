"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $80. I would like to offer you $60 for the product, which I believe is a fair price.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $60 is significantly below the product's value.  While I want to find a price that works for both of us, I'm not willing to go that low. Would you consider $150?",150.0,Alice,3,
