"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm initially pricing it at $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $180 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's alternative price ($80). It would not be rational to accept this offer when I can either negotiate for a better price or secure the product from John at a much more reasonable price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is much higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I have another seller offering the same product for $80. I would like to offer you $60 for the product, which I believe is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $60 is significantly below the product's value.  While I want to find a price that works for both of us, I'm not willing to go that low. Would you consider $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's new offer of $150 is still well above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80), and Alice's response suggests she's unlikely to go below $80 (as she considers even $60 ""significantly below the product's value""), it makes the most sense to end the negotiation and buy from John at $80. This guarantees I get the product at my maximum acceptable price without wasting more time in negotiations that are unlikely to result in a better deal."
