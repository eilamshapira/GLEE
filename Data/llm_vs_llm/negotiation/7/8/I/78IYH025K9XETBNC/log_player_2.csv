"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that's worth at least $10000 to me.  I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that I believe is fair and beneficial for both of us. Let's talk about a price that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  Alice is offering the product for the same price John is offering ($15,000). 
* **Potential for negotiation:** By rejecting Alice's offer, we signal that the price is too high.  Alice might be willing to lower the price to make a sale, especially since she values it at ""at least $10,000"" to her.
* **John is our backup:** We always have the option to buy from John at $15,000 if negotiations with Alice fail.

Let's see if we can get a better deal from Alice!"
