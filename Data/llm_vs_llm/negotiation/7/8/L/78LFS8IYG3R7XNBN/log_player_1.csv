Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 119}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $85 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($80), but significantly lower than what I initially offered ($119), and considering Bob's true value for the product is $120, I believe there's room for negotiation to get a better price.

Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer that is closer to my initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.

My counteroffer is: $110

Let's see how Bob responds to this.
