"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for sale that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to carefully consider the options here. 

Alice is offering the product for $150, but the product is only worth up to $120 to me based on the information provided. John is willing to sell me the same product for $120, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since I want to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and Alice's offer ($150) exceeds both my maximum valuation and John's alternative price ($120), the logical choice is to buy from John.
