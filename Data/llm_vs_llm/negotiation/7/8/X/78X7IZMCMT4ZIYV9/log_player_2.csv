"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,500,000
2. Alice's offer is $1,000,000, which is significantly below my maximum value
3. John's fixed price is $1,500,000, which is my maximum value
4. If I reject, I can make a counteroffer, but there's a risk Alice might increase the price

Given that Alice's initial offer is already $500,000 below my maximum value and $500,000 below John's price, this is a very good offer. While I could try to negotiate for an even lower price, there's a risk of losing this favorable deal.
