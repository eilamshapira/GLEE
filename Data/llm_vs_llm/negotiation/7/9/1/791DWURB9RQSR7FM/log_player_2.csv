"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","The offer of $15,500 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative price ($8,000). Accepting Alice's offer would mean paying $7,500 more than the product is worth to me, which doesn't make financial sense.

Since I can get the exact same product from John for $8,000, which matches my maximum valuation, I should take that option.
