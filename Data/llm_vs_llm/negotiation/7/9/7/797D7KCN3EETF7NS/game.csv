"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe $1100000 is too high for this product. I understand the value you're offering, but I'd like to propose a more reasonable price of $900000. This still provides you with a good profit margin while being more aligned with market value. Would you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we make a deal at $1000000? This offers you significant savings while also recognizing the worth of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
