Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe $1100000 is too high for this product. I understand the value you're offering, but I'd like to propose a more reasonable price of $900000. This still provides you with a good profit margin while being more aligned with market value. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
