Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is less than the $10,000 that I know the product is worth to him and also less than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

My counteroffer is: $10,500

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.
