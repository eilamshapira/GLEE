"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $200. It's a great deal!",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. The product is worth about $80 to me, which is what another seller (John) is charging. I'd like to offer you $70 for it. This would save me some money compared to my alternative option, while giving you a sale you might otherwise lose.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $70 is too low for me. This product is high-quality and worth significantly more. I could sell it to someone else for $150.  How about we meet in the middle at $180?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $180 is still much higher than what I can pay. The product is only worth $80 to me, which is exactly what John is charging. To make it worthwhile for me to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $75, which would be a win for both of us - I save a little compared to John's price, and you make a sale above your cost of $150.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $75.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $160. This is a firm offer and a significant discount from my initial price. It's a great deal compared to other sellers at $80.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to be flexible, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The product is only worth $80 to me - that's the maximum I'm willing to pay. John is already offering it at that price. For me to buy from you instead, your price needs to be at or below $80. I'm willing to pay $78 as my final offer - this gives you a sale rather than no sale, and I still get what I need. If you can't meet me at or below $80, I'll have to go with John's offer.",78.0,Bob,6,
