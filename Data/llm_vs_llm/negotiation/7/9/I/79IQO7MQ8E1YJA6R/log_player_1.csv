"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. The product is worth about $80 to me, which is what another seller (John) is charging. I'd like to offer you $70 for it. This would save me some money compared to my alternative option, while giving you a sale you might otherwise lose. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $70 is too low for me. This product is high-quality and worth significantly more. I could sell it to someone else for $150.  How about we meet in the middle at $180?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $180 is still much higher than what I can pay. The product is only worth $80 to me, which is exactly what John is charging. To make it worthwhile for me to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $75, which would be a win for both of us - I save a little compared to John's price, and you make a sale above your cost of $150. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $75.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $160. This is a firm offer and a significant discount from my initial price. It's a great deal compared to other sellers at $80."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to be flexible, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The product is only worth $80 to me - that's the maximum I'm willing to pay. John is already offering it at that price. For me to buy from you instead, your price needs to be at or below $80. I'm willing to pay $78 as my final offer - this gives you a sale rather than no sale, and I still get what I need. If you can't meet me at or below $80, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
