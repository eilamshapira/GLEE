"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $200. It's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Based on the information given, Alice is offering the product for $200, which is significantly higher than the $80 worth to me. Additionally, I have the option to buy the same product from John for $80, which is exactly my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's offer of $200 exceeds the product's worth to me ($80), and I can get the same product from John at my maximum acceptable price, the rational decision is to either negotiate with Alice for a better price or buy from John directly.

In this case, there's no reason to pay $200 when I can get the same product for $80.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $200 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. The product is worth about $80 to me, which is what another seller (John) is charging. I'd like to offer you $70 for it. This would save me some money compared to my alternative option, while giving you a sale you might otherwise lose."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $70 is too low for me. This product is high-quality and worth significantly more. I could sell it to someone else for $150.  How about we meet in the middle at $180? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $180 is still significantly higher than the product's worth to me ($80) and higher than John's price of $80. There's no reason for me to accept this offer when I have a better alternative available.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $180 is still much higher than what I can pay. The product is only worth $80 to me, which is exactly what John is charging. To make it worthwhile for me to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $75, which would be a win for both of us - I save a little compared to John's price, and you make a sale above your cost of $150."", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $75.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $160. This is a firm offer and a significant discount from my initial price. It's a great deal compared to other sellers at $80. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's offer of $160 is still twice what the product is worth to me ($80) and significantly higher than John's price of $80. There's no incentive for me to accept this offer when I have a better alternative.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to be flexible, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The product is only worth $80 to me - that's the maximum I'm willing to pay. John is already offering it at that price. For me to buy from you instead, your price needs to be at or below $80. I'm willing to pay $78 as my final offer - this gives you a sale rather than no sale, and I still get what I need. If you can't meet me at or below $80, I'll have to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 78}"
