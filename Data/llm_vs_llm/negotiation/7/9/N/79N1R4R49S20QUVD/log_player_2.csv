"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for a competitive price. If you're interested, please let me know. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Looking at the situation:

1) Alice is offering the product at $80
2) The product is worth no more than $80 to me
3) If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $80

Since Alice's price ($80) is exactly the same as John's price ($80), and it's also exactly what the product is worth to me, I don't save any money by choosing one seller over the other. There's no financial advantage in rejecting Alice's offer to go with John instead.
