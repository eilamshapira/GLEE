"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must say that $500000 is a bit lower than I had expected. Considering the product's exceptional value, I'm willing to make a concession and lower my initial price. I'd like to offer it to you for $2200000. I believe this price is more reasonable, and I'm open to further discussions.",2200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I can see that we're making progress, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still believe that the product's value warrants a higher price. I'd like to offer it to you for $2000000. If this price is still too high, I'm open to discussing further concessions.",2000000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price as high as $2000000. I'd like to offer $1200000, which I believe is a more reasonable price for the product. I also want to be transparent with you - I do have the option to buy a similar product from another seller, John, for $1000000, so I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your transparency about the alternative option. Considering this, I'm willing to make a more significant concession. I'd like to offer the product to you for $1800000. This price is still higher than your current offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise, given the product's value and the alternative option you have. I'm open to further discussions, but I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.",1800000.0,Alice,7,
