"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at a price of $12000. This is a fair market value for the product, and it's the same price that my other potential buyer John is willing to pay. However, I wanted to give you the first opportunity to purchase it. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
