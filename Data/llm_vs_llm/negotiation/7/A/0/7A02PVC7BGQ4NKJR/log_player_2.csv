"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer is $15,000, which is the same price as John's offer, and it's the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, it makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There's a possibility to get a better deal from Alice, while I still have John's $15,000 offer as a backup.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a significantly lower offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be insulting. I'll offer $10,000, which is a reasonable starting point that gives room for back-and-forth negotiation while still potentially saving me money compared to John's price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has made a significant reduction from her initial offer of $15,000 to $13,000, which would save me $2,000 compared to John's price. This is a substantial improvement and represents a good deal. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might become less flexible, and I might lose this favorable offer. Given that this price is well below my maximum budget and provides significant savings, I'll accept this offer.
