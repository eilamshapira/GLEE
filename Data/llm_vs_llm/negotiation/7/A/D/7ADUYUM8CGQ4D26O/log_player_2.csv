"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is close to the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000), but still slightly below it, and considering that the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer could potentially lead to a better deal. Therefore, the best course of action at this point is to reject Alice's offer and proceed with making a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, and I'm looking to save as much money as possible while still being willing to pay up to $1,200,000, a reasonable counteroffer would be to meet somewhere in the middle but slightly favoring my side since I have the option to buy from John for $1,200,000. A strategic approach would be to start with a lower offer to leave room for further negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,050,000 is a significant reduction from her initial offer of $1,100,000, indicating a willingness to negotiate and potentially meet closer to a mutually beneficial price. Given that my maximum budget is $1,200,000 and the product's value to Alice is $800,000, there's still room for negotiation. However, Alice's offer is getting closer to my upper limit, and I need to weigh the potential for further reduction against the risk of losing the deal or having to pay John's higher price of $1,200,000.

Considering these factors, accepting Alice's offer of $1,050,000 seems like the most prudent decision at this point. It's a good price, considering I was willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially breaking down.
