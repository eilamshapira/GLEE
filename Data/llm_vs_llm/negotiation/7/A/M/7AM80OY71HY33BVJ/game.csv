"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find $2500000 to be significantly above market value. I have other options available to me, including a reliable seller offering the same product for $800000. However, I'd like to do business with you if possible. I'm willing to offer $600000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $600000 is significantly below the product's actual value and my minimum acceptable price. While you mentioned another seller offering it at $800000, I can assure you our product offers superior quality and value. I understand you're looking for a good deal, so I'm willing to reduce my initial price to $1900000, which represents a substantial discount from my original offer. This price reflects the true value and quality of what you're getting. I'm open to further discussion, but please note that I have another buyer ready to purchase at $1500000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. However, I need to be direct: $1900000 is still well above what I can justify paying for this product. While you mention having another buyer at $1500000, I must focus on my own budget constraints. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000, which is very close to market value. This is a serious offer that would give you an immediate sale, and I hope you'll consider it carefully.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $700000 remains significantly below what this product is worth. Based on my knowledge of the market and the product's quality, I can't accept less than $1600000. This price is already competitive when considering the true value of what you're getting. While I understand you have budget constraints, I must also consider that I have a guaranteed buyer at $1500000. I'm willing to offer you this slight advantage over my alternative buyer because I'd prefer to do business with you, but I cannot go lower than this price. Please consider carefully - this represents my best offer while still remaining reasonable for both parties.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
