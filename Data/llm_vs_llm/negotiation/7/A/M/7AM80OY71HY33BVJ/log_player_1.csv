Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find $2500000 to be significantly above market value. I have other options available to me, including a reliable seller offering the same product for $800000. However, I'd like to do business with you if possible. I'm willing to offer $600000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below the product's actual value and my minimum acceptable price. While you mentioned another seller offering it at $800,000, I can assure you our product offers superior quality and value. I understand you're looking for a good deal, so I'm willing to reduce my initial price to $1,900,000, which represents a substantial discount from my original offer. This price reflects the true value and quality of what you're getting. I'm open to further discussion, but please note that I have another buyer ready to purchase at $1,500,000."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. However, I need to be direct: $1900000 is still well above what I can justify paying for this product. While you mention having another buyer at $1500000, I must focus on my own budget constraints. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000, which is very close to market value. This is a serious offer that would give you an immediate sale, and I hope you'll consider it carefully. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $700,000 remains significantly below what this product is worth. Based on my knowledge of the market and the product's quality, I can't accept less than $1,600,000. This price is already competitive when considering the true value of what you're getting. While I understand you have budget constraints, I must also consider that I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000. I'm willing to offer you this slight advantage over my alternative buyer because I'd prefer to do business with you, but I cannot go lower than this price. Please consider carefully - this represents my best offer while still remaining reasonable for both parties."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
