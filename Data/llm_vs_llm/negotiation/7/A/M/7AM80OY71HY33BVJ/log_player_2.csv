"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration of its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2500000. This product represents a significant investment opportunity with substantial returns. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $2,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000. Since I can buy the product from John for $800,000, there's no reason to accept such a high price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, attempting to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find $2,500,000 to be significantly above market value. I have other options available to me, including a reliable seller offering the same product for $800,000. However, I'd like to do business with you if possible. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $600000 is significantly below the product's actual value and my minimum acceptable price. While you mentioned another seller offering it at $800000, I can assure you our product offers superior quality and value. I understand you're looking for a good deal, so I'm willing to reduce my initial price to $1900000, which represents a substantial discount from my original offer. This price reflects the true value and quality of what you're getting. I'm open to further discussion, but please note that I have another buyer ready to purchase at $1500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,900,000 is still more than twice my maximum value of $800,000. Even though Alice mentions having another buyer at $1,500,000, this doesn't change the fact that I can get the product from John for $800,000. I'll continue negotiating, but if Alice doesn't come down significantly, I'll eventually need to go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. However, I need to be direct: $1,900,000 is still well above what I can justify paying for this product. While you mention having another buyer at $1,500,000, I must focus on my own budget constraints. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, which is very close to market value. This is a serious offer that would give you an immediate sale, and I hope you'll consider it carefully."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $700000 remains significantly below what this product is worth. Based on my knowledge of the market and the product's quality, I can't accept less than $1600000. This price is already competitive when considering the true value of what you're getting. While I understand you have budget constraints, I must also consider that I have a guaranteed buyer at $1500000. I'm willing to offer you this slight advantage over my alternative buyer because I'd prefer to do business with you, but I cannot go lower than this price. Please consider carefully - this represents my best offer while still remaining reasonable for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price that works for me. She consistently maintains prices well above my maximum value of $800,000 and claims to have another buyer at $1,500,000. Since we're five rounds in and still nowhere near my maximum acceptable price, it makes the most sense to take John's offer of $800,000 rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to succeed."
