Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider what would be the best approach to maximize my profit from selling this product.

The product is worth at least $80 to me, and I have a guaranteed $80 from John as a backup. This means I should offer Bob a price above $80 to increase my profit.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I need to balance setting a high price to maximize profit with the risk of Bob rejecting my offer. A moderate premium over my minimum acceptable price seems reasonable.
