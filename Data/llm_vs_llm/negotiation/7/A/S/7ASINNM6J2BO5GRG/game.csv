"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, I believe your asking price is a bit high considering market conditions. I'm prepared to offer $900000 for the product. This offer provides you with a solid profit margin while being more aligned with current market rates. I look forward to your response.",900000.0,Bob,2,
