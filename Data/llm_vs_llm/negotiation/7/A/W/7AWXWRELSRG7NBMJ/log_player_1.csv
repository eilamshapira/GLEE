Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make an offer that maximizes my profit while being reasonable enough that Bob might accept it. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, I know that's his maximum value. I have a guaranteed outside option to sell to John for $12,000, so I should ask for more than that from Bob.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll adjust my counteroffer, considering that Bob rejected my initial $15,000 price but offered $10,000. His offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 (since I can sell to John for that amount). I'll come down from my initial offer but still aim for a price above my minimum.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my asking price again but need to stay above my $12,000 minimum. Bob has increased his offer from $10,000 to $11,000, which shows he's willing to negotiate upward, but he's still below what I can get from John.
