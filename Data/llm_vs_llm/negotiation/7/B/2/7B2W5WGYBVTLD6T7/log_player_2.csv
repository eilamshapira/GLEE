"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.  Let me know what you think!  I'm confident this is a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice believes the product is valuable, her opening offer matches your maximum price. There's no incentive to accept immediately. By rejecting, you open the possibility of:

* **Alice lowering her price:** She might be very motivated to sell and could return with a better offer.
* **Sticking with John:** You haven't lost anything by rejecting, as John provides a fallback option at the same price."
