"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11500. It's worth $12000 to you, so this is a great deal! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth up to $12,000 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $11,500
3. If I reject, I can buy from John for $12,000

Alice's offer ($11,500) is $500 less than John's price ($12,000). Since both options would provide me with the same product and Alice's price is lower, I should accept Alice's offer to save money.
