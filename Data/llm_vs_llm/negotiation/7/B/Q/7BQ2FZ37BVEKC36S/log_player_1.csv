Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$50 is far too low! I'm not willing to sell it for that price.  I will counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a price that's more reasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm willing to come down a bit to $175.  This is still well above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. He clearly isn't willing to pay a fair price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  At least I'll get a decent price for the product."
