"Alice's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Based on the information provided:

- The product is worth no more than $80 to me (Bob)
- Alice is offering the product for $99
- John is willing to sell the same product for $80
- My goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible

Since John's price ($80) is lower than Alice's price ($99), and $80 is the maximum value the product has to me, I should buy from John.
