"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at $12000. This is a competitive price for the quality and features this product offers.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $12000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $6000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I can't go as low as $6000. The product's value to me is no less than $8000, and I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you. Could you consider $9500? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $9500 is still above what I'm willing to spend. Considering your minimum value and my budget constraints, how about we settle at $7000? This would be a fair compromise, given that you mentioned the product's value to you is no less than $8000.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation. While I understand your budget constraints, $7000 is still below what I need for this product. As I mentioned, the product is worth at least $8000 to me, and I have John ready to pay that amount. However, I'd still prefer to work with you if possible. My final offer is $8500 - this is the lowest I can go while still making this worthwhile for me.",8500.0,Alice,5,
