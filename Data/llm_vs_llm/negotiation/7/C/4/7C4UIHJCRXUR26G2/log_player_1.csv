Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $12000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $6000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I can't go as low as $6,000. The product's value to me is no less than $8,000, and I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you. Could you consider $9,500? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 9500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $9500 is still above what I'm willing to spend. Considering your minimum value and my budget constraints, how about we settle at $7000? This would be a fair compromise, given that you mentioned the product's value to you is no less than $8000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation. While I understand your budget constraints, $7,000 is still below what I need for this product. As I mentioned, the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, and I have John ready to pay that amount. However, I'd still prefer to work with you if possible. My final offer is $8,500 - this is the lowest I can go while still making this worthwhile for me."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
