"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I can't go as low as $6000. The product's value to me is no less than $8000, and I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you. Could you consider $9500? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still above what I'm willing to spend. Considering your minimum value and my budget constraints, how about we settle at $7,000? This would be a fair compromise, given that you mentioned the product's value to you is no less than $8,000."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation. While I understand your budget constraints, $7000 is still below what I need for this product. As I mentioned, the product is worth at least $8000 to me, and I have John ready to pay that amount. However, I'd still prefer to work with you if possible. My final offer is $8500 - this is the lowest I can go while still making this worthwhile for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.
