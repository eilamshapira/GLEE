"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let's start the negotiation."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I can only stretch to $60 for this product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $60 is too low for me, and I have the option to sell to John for $150 if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is quite far from what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a fair price for this product. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 175}"
