"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to consider my options carefully:

1. Alice is offering the product for $18,000
2. John is offering the same product for $12,000
3. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me

Since John's offer ($12,000) is $6,000 less than Alice's offer ($18,000), and matches the maximum value of the product to me, the decision is clear.
