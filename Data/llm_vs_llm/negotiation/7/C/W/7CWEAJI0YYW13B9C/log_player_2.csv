(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is above my target price of $800,000, I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. This gives me the opportunity to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is reasonable and closer to my target price. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower offer.

However, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. Since I have 8 rounds left, I'll reject the offer again and try to make another counteroffer to see if I can get an even better deal.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 2, I offered $700,000, and Alice rejected it. Now, Alice has offered $1,000,000. To try to meet in the middle and make progress in the negotiation, I'll increase my offer from $700,000 to $750,000, which is still below my target price of $800,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $950,000 is still above my target price of $800,000. While she is getting closer, I'm not willing to pay that much. Since I have 5 rounds left, I'll reject the offer again and try to make another counteroffer. I'll increase my previous offer of $750,000 to $775,000, hoping to meet Alice somewhere in the middle.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","As previously decided, I'll make a counteroffer of $775,000, which is an increase from my previous offer of $750,000. This offer is still below my target price of $800,000 and shows that I'm willing to negotiate and meet Alice halfway.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $900,000 is still above my target price of $800,000. At this point, I've negotiated for several rounds, and Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $1,100,000. However, I'm getting close to my limit, and buying from John for $800,000 is starting to look like a more attractive option. Since I have 3 rounds left, I'll think carefully about my next move.

Considering the options, I think I'll reject Alice's offer again, but I'll also consider the fact that I might not get a better deal from her. My next counteroffer will be closer to my target price.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice's last offer was $900,000 and I'm running out of rounds, I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my target price of $800,000. I'll offer $825,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $775,000 and Alice's last offer. This shows that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I'm not willing to go above my target price.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $875,000 is still above my target price of $800,000, but it's getting very close to the point where I might consider accepting it. However, since I have one more round left and buying from John for $800,000 is a viable option, I'll think carefully about my next move.

Considering the options, I think buying from John for $800,000 is the best choice at this point. Alice's offer is still $75,000 above what I can get from John, and I don't think I can negotiate a better deal with Alice in the last round.
