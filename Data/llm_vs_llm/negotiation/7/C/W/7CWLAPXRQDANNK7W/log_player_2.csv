"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'd like to offer it to you at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Based on the information provided, let me analyze the options:

1. Alice is offering the product for $18,000
2. You value the product at no more than $12,000
3. John is willing to sell you the same product for $12,000

Since Alice's offer ($18,000) exceeds both your maximum valuation ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000), the economically rational decision would be to buy from John instead.
