"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Based on the information provided:

- The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me (Bob)
- Alice is offering to sell it for $1,500,000
- I can buy the same product from John for $1,000,000

Alice's offer ($1,500,000) exceeds both the product's value to me and John's alternative price. The rational choice is to buy from John at the lower price.
