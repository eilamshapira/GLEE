"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to make a smart decision here. Alice's offer of $18,000 is substantially higher than the product's worth to me ($10,000) and even higher than what Alice values it at ($15,000). It's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $10,000.

Since this is just the first round of negotiation, I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably below Alice's valuation but still gives her some profit.

{""product_price"": $11,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her price from $18,000 to $16,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still significantly higher than the product's worth to me ($10,000) and higher than John's guaranteed price of $10,000.

Since I can always buy from John at $10,000, and we still have several rounds of negotiation left, I should reject this offer and try again with a higher counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still keep it at a price that would be beneficial for me.

{""product_price"": $12,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her price to $15,500, which is just above her valuation of $15,000. This shows she's becoming more reasonable but is still trying to maximize her profit.

Since $15,500 is still significantly higher than John's guaranteed price of $10,000, and we have more negotiation rounds remaining, I should reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer again to show good faith in the negotiation, but still keep it at a price that would be beneficial for me compared to John's offer.

{""product_price"": $13,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her price to $15,000, which matches exactly her valuation of the product. This suggests she's now willing to sell at her minimum acceptable price.

However, $15,000 is still significantly higher than John's guaranteed price of $10,000, and the product is only worth $10,000 to me. Since I can buy the same product from John at $10,000, which is the maximum I value the product at, I should buy from John instead.
