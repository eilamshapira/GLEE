"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Since Alice is offering the product at your maximum price of $150, it's the best option. There's no benefit to rejecting her offer and buying from John at the same price."
