"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is too low for this product. I could come down to $120.  It's a fair offer considering the value it brings. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $60 was a bit low, but $120 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $70. This is my highest offer so far, and I think it's a reasonable price considering my budget. Let me know if this works for you.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  How about $95? This is a significant discount from my original offer and a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,5,
