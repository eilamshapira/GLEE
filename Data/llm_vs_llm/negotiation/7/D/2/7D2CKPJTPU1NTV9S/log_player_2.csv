"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay, and I have the option to buy the product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately. However, I also don't want to give up the potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. This will give us room to negotiate and potentially find a mutually acceptable price.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $13,000 is more reasonable, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since I have 8 rounds left to negotiate, I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to make a counteroffer that's closer to my target price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's previous offer of $13,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous offer of $5,000, but still lower than Alice's current offer. This will show that I'm willing to negotiate and meet Alice halfway.
