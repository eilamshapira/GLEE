"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I've priced it competitively at $1500000, but I'm confident its value to you will far exceed that. I'm open to discussing your thoughts and potentially adjusting the price slightly based on your needs. Let's talk!",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but I was hoping to stay within a budget of $1200000. I understand the value of the product, but I also need to consider my financial constraints. Would you be willing to accept this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1200000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference. How about $1350000? This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit and demonstrates my willingness to find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to stay closer to my initial budget. How about we settle for $1300000? This way, we both make some concessions and can still walk away with a deal that benefits both parties.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
