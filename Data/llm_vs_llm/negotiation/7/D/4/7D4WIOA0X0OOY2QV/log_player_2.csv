"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I've priced it competitively at $1500000, but I'm confident its value to you will far exceed that. I'm open to discussing your thoughts and potentially adjusting the price slightly based on your needs. Let's talk! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

# Bob's counteroffer: Alice, thank you for the offer, but I was hoping to stay within a budget of $1,200,000. I understand the value of the product, but I also need to consider my financial constraints. Would you be willing to accept this price?"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1200000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference. How about $1350000? This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit and demonstrates my willingness to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

# Bob's counteroffer: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to stay closer to my initial budget. How about we settle for $1,300,000? This way, we both make some concessions and can still walk away with a deal that benefits both parties."
