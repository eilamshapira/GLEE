Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $175. I believe it's a great deal for its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin by offering the product at a price higher than my minimum ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($100). This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, I provide a reason (""a great deal for its value"") to potentially sway Bob and make him consider the offer.
* **Alternative in Mind:** I know I have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
