"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I am looking for something more within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price within your budget. However, $80 is too low for this product given its value. I can come down to $135, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This product has features that justify this price point.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the reduction, Alice. However, I have a budget constraint and can only go up to $90. I believe this is a fair compromise given the alternatives available to me.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand you have budget constraints. However, I need to be transparent - this product costs me no less than $120, which means I can't go below that price without taking a loss. I can offer it to you at $125, which is very close to my absolute minimum. This is significantly lower than my initial offer and represents excellent value for the product's quality.",125.0,Alice,5,
