"Alice, while I appreciate the potential of the product, your asking price is quite high. I'm willing to purchase it for $800000. Let's discuss further.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $800000 is significantly below the product's true value. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1600000.  This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a very attractive deal for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1600000 is still too high for me. I'm ready to raise my offer to $1000000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1400000, but that's my final offer. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and it reflects the importance of completing this deal with you.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're making an effort to meet me in the middle, but $1400000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to raise my offer to $1100000. This is very close to my maximum budget, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find common ground.  While $1100000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below what I can reasonably accept. I'm willing to make one last compromise and drop my price to $1300000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  I hope you'll reconsider and agree to this price.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
