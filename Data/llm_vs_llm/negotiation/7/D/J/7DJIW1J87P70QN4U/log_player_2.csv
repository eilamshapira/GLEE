Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product worth well over $1.5 million.  I'm confident it can be a valuable asset for you.  My initial offer is $2000000.  Let's discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $800000 is significantly below the product's true value. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1600000.  This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a very attractive deal for you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1400000, but that's my final offer. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and it reflects the importance of completing this deal with you.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find common ground.  While $1100000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below what I can reasonably accept. I'm willing to make one last compromise and drop my price to $1300000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  I hope you'll reconsider and agree to this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
