Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 120}

Reasoning: Since the product is worth $120 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $120, there's no reason for me to offer Bob a lower price. Bob values the product at $100, so he will likely reject my offer of $120, but that's fine because I can then sell to John for the same amount. This way, I maximize my earnings by ensuring I get $120 for the product."
