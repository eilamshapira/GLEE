"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $10000. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $10,000 is below my maximum budget of $15,000, I'll consider it. However, I'd like to try to negotiate a better price to save as much money as possible.

Given that this is the first round and I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal.

My decision: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, to test the waters and see how flexible she is on the price.

My counteroffer is: 
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that you're aiming for a lower price. However, considering the value and quality of the product, I believe $9000 is a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has made a new offer of $9,000, which is still below my maximum budget of $15,000. However, I'd like to continue negotiating to see if I can get an even better deal.

Since Alice's new offer is only $1,000 lower than her previous offer, I'll reject it and make another counteroffer to try to bring the price down further.

My decision: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

(I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a new counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous offer, to show Alice that I'm still interested in the product and willing to negotiate.

My counteroffer is: 
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"
