Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest. I’m offering the product at $15,000. Please let me know if you’d like to proceed with this offer."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is quite high for my budget. I've done my market research, and I can find similar products for much less. I'd like to offer $10000 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
