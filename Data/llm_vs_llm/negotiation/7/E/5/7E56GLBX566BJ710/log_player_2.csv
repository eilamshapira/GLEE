"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest. I’m offering the product at $15000. Please let me know if you’d like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $15,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000), I should either reject and try to negotiate or buy from John. Since I have the opportunity to negotiate and potentially get a better price from Alice, I'll reject this initial high offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is quite high for my budget. I've done my market research, and I can find similar products for much less. I'd like to offer $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
