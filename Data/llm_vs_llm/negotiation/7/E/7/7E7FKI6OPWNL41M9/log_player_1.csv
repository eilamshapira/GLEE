Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm delighted to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Considering its unparalleled value, I'm offering it to you for $1,900,000."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the value of the product, $1900000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $1300000 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a tough one. Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. However, selling to John now guarantees me $1,500,000, which is still a good outcome. I also have to consider that Bob values the product at $1,500,000, which is the minimum I am ready to sell the product for.

Given the current situation, I'll take the risk of further negotiations.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, I'm not able to accept $1,300,000. Considering the unique qualities of this product and its value, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,800,000."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $1800000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $1400000. Please let me know if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is getting closer to the point where I consider selling to John. Bob is still offering less than the product is worth to him, and I am not getting offers close to what I want for the product.

I still think there is room for negotiation, so I will reject and counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1700000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1450000 as my final counteroffer. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob is still offering below the product's value to me. This is the final offer according to him. At this point, I have to decide. Bob's offer is closer to $1,500,000, but if I reject it, there is no guarantee he will increase his offer, and I would be losing money. However, I can also sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000.

I will choose to sell the product to John to secure the deal.
