"Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I should evaluate Alice's offer compared to the value I assign to the product and John's alternative offer.

Alice is offering the product for $130, which is $20 less than John's price of $150.

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and Alice's offer is below that threshold and lower than John's price, accepting Alice's offer would be the most economical choice.
