"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is only worth $100 to me, so I won't accept Alice's offer of $120. Since I can buy from John for $100, I'll use that as leverage to negotiate with Alice. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better price from Alice, knowing I always have John's $100 offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

I'll offer $90 to Alice. While this is below her cost of $120, it gives room for negotiation. If she rejects this, I expect her to counter with a lower price than her initial $120. I'm starting low but not insultingly low, and I have the leverage of knowing I can always go to John for $100 if needed."
