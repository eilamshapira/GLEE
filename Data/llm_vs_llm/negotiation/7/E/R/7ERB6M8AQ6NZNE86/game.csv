"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $12000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $12000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and my initial price, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $17000, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going at this point.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $17000 is still above what I'm willing to spend. I can go up to $13000. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. I'm glad we're making progress. However, I still feel that $13000 is a bit short of the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $16000, which is a significant concession from my initial price.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $16000. I'm trying to meet you halfway, but I really can't go beyond $14000. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to increase your offer. We're getting close to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $14000. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to make a small concession. I can offer it to you for $15500, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going at this point.",15500.0,Alice,7,
