Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $250. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's more than I'm looking to spend. How about I offer you $60 instead? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject Bob's offer of $60 as it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. The offer is not even close to a reasonable range. I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $60 is far too low for this product's value. Given its quality and features, I couldn't go below $200. However, I'm willing to negotiate from there. Would you consider this more reasonable price?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice, but $200 is still more than I'm willing to spend. Let's meet in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Given that Bob's second offer of $80 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and he seems to be making only small increases in his offers, it's best to take the guaranteed $150 from John. Bob's negotiating pattern suggests he's unlikely to reach a price that would be acceptable to me."
