"Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I'm ready to sell. Given its quality and features, I'm offering it at $25000. This product has significant value, and I believe this is a fair price. Are you interested in purchasing at this price?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $25000 is out of my budget. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I can only afford a much lower price. I'd like to offer $4000 for the product.",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but I must note that $4000 is significantly below its value and below my minimum acceptable price. The product is worth at least $10000 to me based on its quality and market value. I can come down from my initial offer - would you consider $18000? This represents a substantial discount from my original price while still reflecting the product's true value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $18000 is still above my budget. I understand that you value the product at $10000, and I respect that. However, I'm looking for a better deal. I'd like to offer $6000 for the product, which is higher than my initial offer and closer to your minimum acceptable price.",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your understanding of my position. While $6000 is moving in the right direction, it's still below what I can accept for this product. Given its quality and value, I can offer it to you for $14000. This is a substantial reduction from my previous offers and represents excellent value. I hope we can find common ground that works for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to lower the price. However, $14000 is still above my budget. I've been considering other options, and I'm willing to make one more offer. I'd like to propose $7500 for the product. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to explore alternative options that better fit my budget.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your improved offer of $7500. We're getting closer, but I'm still not able to go below my minimum threshold for this product. Since you mentioned this is your final offer and you're considering alternatives, I want to be transparent - I have another buyer ready at $10000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. My final offer is $11500, which is substantially lower than all my previous offers and represents exceptional value. If this still doesn't work for your budget, I understand, but I won't be able to go lower than this price.",11500.0,Alice,7,
