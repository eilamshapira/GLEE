I understand budget constraints, but I must note that $4,000 is significantly below its value and below my minimum acceptable price. The product is worth at least $10,000 to me based on its quality and market value. I can come down from my initial offer - would you consider $18,000? This represents a substantial discount from my original price while still reflecting the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
