Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but I must note that $4000 is significantly below its value and below my minimum acceptable price. The product is worth at least $10000 to me based on its quality and market value. I can come down from my initial offer - would you consider $18000? This represents a substantial discount from my original price while still reflecting the product's true value.

Alice's offer:

Given its quality and value, I can offer it to you for $14000. This is a substantial reduction from my previous offers and represents excellent value. I hope we can find common ground that works for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your improved offer of $7500. We're getting closer, but I'm still not able to go below my minimum threshold for this product. Since you mentioned this is your final offer and you're considering alternatives, I want to be transparent - I have another buyer ready at $10000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. My final offer is $11500, which is substantially lower than all my previous offers and represents exceptional value.
