"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The rational choice here is to buy from John for $10,000 because:
1. Alice's offer ($15,000) is higher than John's fixed price ($10,000)
2. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
3. Even if I make a counteroffer, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a price below $10,000
4. John's price provides a guaranteed option at the maximum value I'm willing to pay

Therefore, buying from John is the most logical choice to ensure I get the product while not paying more than its worth to me."
