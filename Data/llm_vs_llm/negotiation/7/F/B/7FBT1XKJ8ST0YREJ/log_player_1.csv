Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $3000000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. My initial offer is $500000.

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob. Since his offer is $500,000, I'll try to find a middle ground that is still favorable to me. My counteroffer is $2,000,000. This price is lower than my initial offer but still reflects the product's value.
