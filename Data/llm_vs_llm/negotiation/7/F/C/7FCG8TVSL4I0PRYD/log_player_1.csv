"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $80? This would be a fair price that works better for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Given that my goal is to earn as much as possible and I know John will buy it for $80, and since $80 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I have a decision to make. Bob's offer is the same as John's. Since it's only round 2, there's still time to negotiate for a higher price with Bob. However, I also do not want to risk not selling the product. I'll take the risk and try for a higher price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, I'll try to negotiate a bit higher.

{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate it. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}"
