"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $120
2. John is also selling it for $120
3. The product is worth no more than $120 to me
4. Since this is the first round, I should try to negotiate a better price with Alice

Since Alice's initial offer is equal to John's price and equal to my maximum value, it makes sense to try negotiating for a lower price. There's no risk in making a counteroffer since I can always fall back on John's offer later if needed.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower to leave room for negotiation but not so low as to be offensive.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $80? This would be a fair price that works better for me."", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate it. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","This is a good development:

1. Alice has dropped her price from $120 to $100, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This price is $20 less than both John's price and my maximum value
3. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might increase her price again
4. $100 represents a significant 20% savings from my maximum budget

Given this is a favorable offer with a clear $20 savings, and considering the risk that further negotiation might not yield better results, I should accept this offer.
