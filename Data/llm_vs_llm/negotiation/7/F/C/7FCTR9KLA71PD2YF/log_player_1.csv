At this point, I have 2 rounds left to negotiate, and Bob's offers are not increasing significantly. Considering the limited number of rounds left and the fact that Bob's offers are still far from my minimum acceptable price, I think it's time to consider selling the product to John for $150, which is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with.
