"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to be honest that $20000 is significantly above my budget. I know there's another seller offering the same product for $8000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $5000 for the product. What do you think?",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your honest feedback and for making an offer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $5000. Considering you mentioned another seller offering it for $8000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product for $14000, which is a significant discount from my initial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14000 is still well above what I can justify spending. The other seller is offering the exact same product for $8000, which is already at the very top of my budget. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer $6500, which would save me some money compared to the other option while still giving you a fair profit. What do you say?",6500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your continued interest in the product and for sharing more details about your budget. I understand that $14000 is out of your reach, and I appreciate your willingness to offer $6500. Considering the other seller's price of $8000 and your budget constraint, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product for $9500, which is significantly lower than my initial price and closer to the other seller's offer. This price reflects the value I believe the product holds, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate you coming down significantly in price, Alice. Your offer of $9500 shows you're serious about making a deal. However, I need to be straightforward - the other seller is offering the exact same product for $8000, which is already the maximum value this product has for me. If you can match or beat that price, I'd be happy to buy from you instead. My final offer is $7500, which would still give me a small savings compared to the alternative while giving you a fair deal. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer of $7500 and the honesty about your budget and the other seller's price. I understand that you're looking for the best deal, and I respect that. However, as I've mentioned before, the product holds a certain value to me, and I've already made significant concessions. Given that the other seller is offering the product for $8000, which you've stated is the maximum value you see in it, I'm willing to make one last adjustment. I can offer the product for $8200, which is slightly above the other seller's price but still a very competitive offer considering our direct negotiation. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I believe we can close the deal satisfactorily for both parties. Please let me know your thoughts.",8200.0,Alice,7,
