"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to be honest that $20000 is significantly above my budget. I know there's another seller offering the same product for $8000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $5000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $5,000 because it's significantly lower than the value I place on the product. Since I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can meet at a higher price point. I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your honest feedback and for making an offer. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $5,000. Considering you mentioned another seller offering it for $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product for $14,000, which is a significant discount from my initial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14000 is still well above what I can justify spending. The other seller is offering the exact same product for $8000, which is already at the very top of my budget. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer $6500, which would save me some money compared to the other option while still giving you a fair profit. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $6,500. While it's an improvement from his previous offer, it's still below the minimum value I have for the product. Since Bob mentioned that $8,000 is at the top of his budget and there's another seller offering the product for that price, I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer that tries to meet Bob closer to his budget while still being mindful of my own valuation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your continued interest in the product and for sharing more details about your budget. I understand that $14,000 is out of your reach, and I appreciate your willingness to offer $6,500. Considering the other seller's price of $8,000 and your budget constraint, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product for $9,500, which is significantly lower than my initial price and closer to the other seller's offer. This price reflects the value I believe the product holds, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down significantly in price, Alice. Your offer of $9500 shows you're serious about making a deal. However, I need to be straightforward - the other seller is offering the exact same product for $8000, which is already the maximum value this product has for me. If you can match or beat that price, I'd be happy to buy from you instead. My final offer is $7500, which would still give me a small savings compared to the alternative while giving you a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $7,500. While it's his final offer and shows he's interested in buying from me, it's still below the value I believe the product is worth. Given that Bob has mentioned the other seller's price of $8,000 as the maximum value he sees in the product, and considering my own minimum valuation, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. Since I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, which is above both Bob's offer and the other seller's price, I'm inclined to hold out for a better deal or explore the option with John. However, I'll proceed to the next round to see if there's any flexibility left in the negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer of $7,500 and the honesty about your budget and the other seller's price. I understand that you're looking for the best deal, and I respect that. However, as I've mentioned before, the product holds a certain value to me, and I've already made significant concessions. Given that the other seller is offering the product for $8,000, which you've stated is the maximum value you see in it, I'm willing to make one last adjustment. I can offer the product for $8,200, which is slightly above the other seller's price but still a very competitive offer considering our direct negotiation. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I believe we can close the deal satisfactorily for both parties. Please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8200}"
