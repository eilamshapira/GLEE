"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Based on the information provided, Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than the maximum value the product is worth to me ($8,000) and also much higher than John's alternative offer of $8,000.

Given that I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's current price. I should try to negotiate with Alice to see if I can get a better price than John's offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to be honest that $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I know there's another seller offering the same product for $8,000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I can offer $5,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your honest feedback and for making an offer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $5000. Considering you mentioned another seller offering it for $8000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product for $14000, which is a significant discount from my initial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $14,000 is still significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative offer ($8,000). While Alice has moved from her initial position, the current offer doesn't provide any advantage over buying from John.

Since I can buy the product from John for $8,000, I should either negotiate further with Alice to try to get a better price or simply go with John's offer. Let me try one more counter-offer with Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still well above what I can justify spending. The other seller is offering the exact same product for $8,000, which is already at the very top of my budget. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer $6,500, which would save me some money compared to the other option while still giving you a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 6500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your continued interest in the product and for sharing more details about your budget. I understand that $14000 is out of your reach, and I appreciate your willingness to offer $6500. Considering the other seller's price of $8000 and your budget constraint, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product for $9500, which is significantly lower than my initial price and closer to the other seller's offer. This price reflects the value I believe the product holds, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $9,500 is getting closer, but it's still higher than John's alternative offer of $8,000. Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and I can buy it for $8,000 from John, there's no reason for me to accept a price higher than that.

At this point, I should either make one more counteroffer to see if Alice will meet or beat John's price, or simply go with John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down significantly in price, Alice. Your offer of $9,500 shows you're serious about making a deal. However, I need to be straightforward - the other seller is offering the exact same product for $8,000, which is already the maximum value this product has for me. If you can match or beat that price, I'd be happy to buy from you instead. My final offer is $7,500, which would still give me a small savings compared to the alternative while giving you a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer of $7500 and the honesty about your budget and the other seller's price. I understand that you're looking for the best deal, and I respect that. However, as I've mentioned before, the product holds a certain value to me, and I've already made significant concessions. Given that the other seller is offering the product for $8000, which you've stated is the maximum value you see in it, I'm willing to make one last adjustment. I can offer the product for $8200, which is slightly above the other seller's price but still a very competitive offer considering our direct negotiation. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I believe we can close the deal satisfactorily for both parties. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's latest offer of $8,200 is still above John's price of $8,000, and since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, accepting Alice's offer would not be rational. 

At this point, since we've been through several rounds of negotiation and Alice seems unwilling to match or beat John's price, the most logical choice is to buy from John instead.
