"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $2500000 is significantly above my budget. I value the product at a much lower price. Would you consider selling it for $600000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but $600000 is significantly below the product's value. My minimum acceptable price is $1500000, as I have another buyer ready at that price point. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Given the product's quality and market value, I can offer it to you for $2100000, which is already a reduction from my initial offer. Would you consider this price?",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but my maximum budget for this product is firm. While I appreciate you considering me, I cannot justify spending $2100000. However, I am still interested. I can offer you $700000.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but I must be transparent that $700000 is still substantially below what I can accept for this product. As I mentioned, I have a guaranteed offer of $1500000 from another buyer. If we're going to continue negotiating, I need to see a more substantial increase in your offer. Given that this is a premium product with exceptional value, I'm willing to come down to $1900000, which represents a significant discount from my initial price. However, if we can't move closer on price, I may need to pursue the other opportunity.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
