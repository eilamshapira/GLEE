Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $2500000 is significantly above my budget. I value the product at a much lower price. Would you consider selling it for $600000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but $600,000 is significantly below the product's value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but I must be transparent that $700,000 is still substantially below what I can accept for this product. As I mentioned, I have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from another buyer. If we're going to continue negotiating, I need to see a more substantial increase in your offer. Given that this is a premium product with exceptional value, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000, which represents a significant discount from my initial price. However, if we can't move closer on price, I may need to pursue the other opportunity."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
