Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but $600000 is significantly below the product's value. My minimum acceptable price is $1500000, as I have another buyer ready at that price point. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Given the product's quality and market value, I can offer it to you for $2100000, which is already a reduction from my initial offer. Would you consider this price?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but I must be transparent that $700000 is still substantially below what I can accept for this product. As I mentioned, I have a guaranteed offer of $1500000 from another buyer. If we're going to continue negotiating, I need to see a more substantial increase in your offer. Given that this is a premium product with exceptional value, I'm willing to come down to $1900000, which represents a significant discount from my initial price. However, if we can't move closer on price, I may need to pursue the other opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.
