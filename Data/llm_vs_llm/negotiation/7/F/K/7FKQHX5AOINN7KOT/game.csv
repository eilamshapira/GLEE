"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14500 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your perspective, $12500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, however. How about $13500? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $13500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. This is still a bit higher than I initially wanted to pay, but I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",13000.0,Bob,4,
