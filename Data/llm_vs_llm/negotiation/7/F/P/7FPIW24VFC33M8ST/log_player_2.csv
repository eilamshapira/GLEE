"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below that threshold, it's a good deal. Additionally, buying from John would cost me $100,000 more, so it's better to accept Alice's offer.
