"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I certainly understand Bob's desire to get the best price possible, and I'm willing to work with him to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, the offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me.

How about we meet halfway? I'm willing to lower my initial offer to $12,000. This way, both parties can feel good about the deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 12000}

Bob, I've reconsidered my initial offer and I'm willing to lower the price to $12,000. This price takes into account both my valuation of the product and your desire to find a bargain. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. I hope you'll consider this new offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I appreciate Bob's effort to find a middle ground, but given that I can sell the product to John for $10,000, it wouldn't be reasonable to accept Bob's offer of $9,500. Therefore, I'll sell the product to John.

It was a pleasure negotiating with you, Bob. Perhaps we can do business again in the future."
