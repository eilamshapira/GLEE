"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its unique features and market value, I'm offering it at $2500000. This is a premium product with significant potential value. Would you be interested in making this purchase?",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to be transparent that your asking price of $2500000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me, which is the same price another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $600000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to my alternative option while still providing you with a sale. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer but I must inform you that $600000 is well below the product's value. I should mention that I have a standing offer of $1000000 from another buyer, so I cannot accept anything below that price. However, I believe this product could provide significant value to you, and I'm willing to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1800000, which I believe is fair given the product's potential value. Would you consider this revised offer?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for lowering your price, Alice. However, $1800000 is still significantly more than what the product is worth to me. I understand you mentioned having another offer at $1000000, but I need to be honest that the maximum value of this product to me is $800000, which is also what John is selling it for. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer $700000, which is higher than my initial offer but still gives me some savings compared to my alternative. This represents a fair middle ground considering my budget constraints.",700000.0,Bob,4,
