Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to be transparent that your asking price of $2500000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me, which is the same price another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $600000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to my alternative option while still providing you with a sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Additionally, Bob's claim about John offering the same product for $800,000 seems to be a negotiation tactic, as I know John is actually willing to buy from me for $1,000,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but if we can't reach a better agreement, I always have the guaranteed option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{
    ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer but I must inform you that $600,000 is well below the product's value. I should mention that I have a standing offer of $1,000,000 from another buyer, so I cannot accept anything below that price. However, I believe this product could provide significant value to you, and I'm willing to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1,800,000, which I believe is fair given the product's potential value. Would you consider this revised offer?"",
    ""product_price"": 1800000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for lowering your price, Alice. However, $1800000 is still significantly more than what the product is worth to me. I understand you mentioned having another offer at $1000000, but I need to be honest that the maximum value of this product to me is $800000, which is also what John is selling it for. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer $700000, which is higher than my initial offer but still gives me some savings compared to my alternative. This represents a fair middle ground considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob continues to offer below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and insists the product is only worth $800,000 to him, it's best to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John. Bob's latest offer of $700,000 is still significantly below my minimum, and given his statements about value and budget constraints, it seems unlikely we'll reach an agreement above $1,000,000. Therefore, I'll take the sure deal with John rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to yield a better outcome."
