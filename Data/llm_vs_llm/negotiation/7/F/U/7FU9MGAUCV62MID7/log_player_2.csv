"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its unique features and market value, I'm offering it at $2500000. This is a premium product with significant potential value. Would you be interested in making this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's asking price of $2,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value ($800,000) and higher than John's guaranteed price ($800,000). There's no reason to accept this offer, and it makes sense to start negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a better price than John's.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, I need to be transparent that your asking price of $2,500,000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, which is the same price another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product, which would save me some money compared to my alternative option while still providing you with a sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer but I must inform you that $600000 is well below the product's value. I should mention that I have a standing offer of $1000000 from another buyer, so I cannot accept anything below that price. However, I believe this product could provide significant value to you, and I'm willing to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1800000, which I believe is fair given the product's potential value. Would you consider this revised offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new price of $1,800,000 is still substantially higher than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000). She mentions having another offer at $1,000,000, but even if true, that's still above my maximum value. I should continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price below $800,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for lowering your price, Alice. However, $1,800,000 is still significantly more than what the product is worth to me. I understand you mentioned having another offer at $1,000,000, but I need to be honest that the maximum value of this product to me is $800,000, which is also what John is selling it for. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer $700,000, which is higher than my initial offer but still gives me some savings compared to my alternative. This represents a fair middle ground considering my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
