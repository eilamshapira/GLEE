"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this unique and valuable product. Given its special qualities, I'm initially offering it at $2000000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing what's best for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price much lower than that. How about we settle for $400000?",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective, but $400000 is significantly below its value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This reflects the product's unique qualities and potential.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm here to get a good deal, and I have other options to consider. I am willing to pay $700000 at most. If we can't settle around this price, I'll have to explore other opportunities.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  However, $700000 undervalues the product significantly.  My final offer is $1300000.  This is a firm price, reflecting a compromise while still respecting the value of what I'm offering.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
