"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product's unique qualities, but $2000000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $900000 to kick off negotiations. I hope we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $900000 is below my expectations.

I'm open to further negotiations, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you, Alice, for considering a lower price. However, $1800000 is still too high for my budget. I am willing to increase my offer to $1100000. I believe this offer fairly reflects the product's worth while staying within my budgetary constraints.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $1100000 is still slightly below my expectations. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1700000. If this price is still too high, I'm open to discussing further options.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, Alice. Unfortunately, $1700000 is still above what I can justify for this purchase. How about $1200000? This is the maximum I'm willing to spend, but I'm hopeful we can strike a deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
