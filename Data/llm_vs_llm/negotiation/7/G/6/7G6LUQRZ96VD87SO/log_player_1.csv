Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm open to negotiations if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product's unique qualities, but $2000000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $900000 to kick off negotiations. I hope we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is below the minimum value I'm willing to accept ($1,200,000), and I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price. My next offer will aim to bring the price closer to my target while still being open to finding a mutually agreeable price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $900,000 is below my expectations.

I'm open to further negotiations, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you, Alice, for considering a lower price. However, $1800000 is still too high for my budget. I am willing to increase my offer to $1100000. I believe this offer fairly reflects the product's worth while staying within my budgetary constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Although Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to my target, it's still below the minimum value I'm willing to accept ($1,200,000), and I have a better option with John. However, I'll try to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price above $1,200,000. My next offer will aim to bring the price closer to my target while considering Bob's budget constraints."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $1,100,000 is still slightly below my expectations. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,700,000. If this price is still too high, I'm open to discussing further options."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, Alice. Unfortunately, $1700000 is still above what I can justify for this purchase. How about $1200000? This is the maximum I'm willing to spend, but I'm hopeful we can strike a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $1,200,000 matches the minimum value I'm willing to accept, and it's the same price John is offering, I'll accept Bob's offer. This way, I'll still get the price I want, and I won't have to rely on the alternative option with John. The negotiation with Bob has reached a mutually agreeable price, and I'm satisfied with the outcome."
