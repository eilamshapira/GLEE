Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","This is a good offer from Bob. At $10,000, it's $2,000 more than what John is offering, and it's a reasonable compromise from my initial offer of $12,000. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's $8,000 offer. I'll accept this offer.
