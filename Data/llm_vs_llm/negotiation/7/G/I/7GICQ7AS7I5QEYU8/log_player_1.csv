Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic offer to maximize my earnings from selling this product. 

The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and if he rejects my offer, I can still sell it to John for $800,000.

Bob will accept any price that gives him some value, meaning any price below $1,000,000. However, I want to set a price that's high enough to maximize my earnings while still giving Bob enough incentive to accept.

If I price it too close to $1,000,000, Bob might reject it because there's little benefit for him. A reasonable approach would be to offer Bob the product at a price that gives him some value while significantly exceeding my $800,000 floor.
