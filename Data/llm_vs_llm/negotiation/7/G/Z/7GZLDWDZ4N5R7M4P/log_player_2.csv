"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a truly exceptional product here, one that I believe will be a game-changer for you. I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a significant investment, but the returns will be even greater. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Looking at the offer:

Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000, which is exactly the maximum value it's worth to me. John is also offering the same product for the same price - $1,500,000.

Since both offers are identical in price, and both would leave me with $0 in savings (paying exactly what the product is worth to me), there's no financial advantage to choosing one seller over the other.
