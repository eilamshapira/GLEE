(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","This is a critical decision point. I've come down quite a bit, and Bob is creeping up. $1,150,000 is still not ideal, but it's significantly above my minimum and there's a risk of Bob walking away. I could try another small counteroffer, but time is running out, and I could risk losing the deal altogether. I'll try one more time to move this towards a sale.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob is being a tough negotiator! At this point, I'm getting closer to the point where the time spent negotiating isn't worth the small difference in price. I also see that there is little chance of getting to a higher price and selling the product for more than $1,162,500. It's time to close the deal.
