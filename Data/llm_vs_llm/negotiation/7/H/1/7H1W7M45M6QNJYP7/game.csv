"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $14000 for it. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your product, but $14000 is a bit high for my budget. Given the current market conditions, I'd be comfortable paying $12500 for it. This provides you with a reasonable profit while fitting within my constraints. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12500 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm still happy to negotiate further, but let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about we split the difference and go with $13250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your offer of $13250 is getting closer to what I was hoping for. I can increase my offer to $12800, which would give you a solid $800 profit margin. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think?",12800.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12800 is still a bit lower than I need to be comfortable with. Let's see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price. How about we split the difference again and go with $13000?",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $13000? This would give you a great deal, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price.",13000.0,Alice,5,
