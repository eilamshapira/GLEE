Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your product, but $14000 is a bit high for my budget. Given the current market conditions, I'd be comfortable paying $12500 for it. This provides you with a reasonable profit while fitting within my constraints. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
