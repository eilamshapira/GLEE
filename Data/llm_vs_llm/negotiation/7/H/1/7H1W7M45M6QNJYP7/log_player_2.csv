"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $14000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I see that Alice is offering her product for $14,000, which is below my maximum value of $15,000. However, I want to try to get a better deal since I know the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, meaning there's room for negotiation.

I'll reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your product, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. Given the current market conditions, I'd be comfortable paying $12,500 for it. This provides you with a reasonable profit while fitting within my constraints. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about we split the difference and go with $13250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer of $14,000 to $13,250, which is a good sign. This is below my maximum value of $15,000, but I still believe there might be room to negotiate a bit more since her cost is $12,000.

I'll reject this offer and make one more counteroffer to see if we can meet closer to the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your offer of $13,250 is getting closer to what I was hoping for. I can increase my offer to $12,800, which would give you a solid $800 profit margin. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $13000? This would give you a great deal, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has now reduced her offer to $13,000, which is a $1,000 reduction from her initial offer. This price gives her a $1,000 profit margin above her $12,000 cost, and it's $2,000 below my maximum value of $15,000, making it a good deal for me too.

Given that we've been negotiating for a few rounds already, and Alice has made meaningful concessions, this seems like a fair compromise. If I continue pushing too hard, there's a risk she might stop negotiating, and I'd have to pay $15,000 to John instead.

I'll accept this offer.
