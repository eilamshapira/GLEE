"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice is offering the product at $900,000, which is $100,000 more than both my maximum value ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000), it makes no sense to accept this offer. The product is only worth $800,000 to me, so paying $900,000 would result in a loss.

I could either buy from John immediately at $800,000 or try to negotiate with Alice for a better price. Since I have nothing to lose by attempting negotiation (I can always fall back on John's offer), I'll reject Alice's current offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I need to make a counteroffer that has a chance of being accepted by Alice, while trying to save money compared to John's price of $800,000. Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice (her cost), she would need some profit to accept my offer.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has lowered her price to $850,000, which is better than her initial offer of $900,000, but it's still $50,000 more than John's price of $800,000. Since the product is only worth $800,000 to me at most, and I can buy it from John for exactly $800,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer.

I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer. If Alice doesn't come down to a price better than John's $800,000, I'll buy from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to find a middle ground that allows both Alice and me to benefit. Since Alice's product is worth $800,000 to her, and John is offering the same product at $800,000, I need to offer Alice something that gives her some profit while saving me money compared to John's price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has now offered the product for $812,500, which is only $12,500 more than John's price of $800,000. However, since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and John is offering it at exactly $800,000, it still makes more financial sense to buy from John rather than accept Alice's current offer.

I'll make one final attempt to negotiate with Alice, but if she doesn't come down to or below $800,000, I'll go with John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make one final reasonable counteroffer to Alice. Since she's come down significantly from her initial price, I'll try a price that's very close to John's $800,000 but still gives Alice a small profit over her cost.
