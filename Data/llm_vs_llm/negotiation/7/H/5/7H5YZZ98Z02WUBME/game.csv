"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $7500 as it's below my minimum threshold. Given the product's value and quality, I can offer it to you for $9000. This is a $500 reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that would benefit both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $9000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8000? I think this would be a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you moving towards the middle ground. Since we're both trying to find a mutually beneficial price, how about $8500? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents a fair split of the difference between our positions.",8500.0,Alice,5,
