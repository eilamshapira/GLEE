"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to counter with $7500. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round because Bob's offer of $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and while I could sell to John for $8,000, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob since the product is worth $10,000 to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $7,500 as it's below my minimum threshold. Given the product's value and quality, I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is a $500 reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that would benefit both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $9000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8000? I think this would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer because while Bob's offer matches John's price, I believe there's still room for negotiation since the product is worth $10,000 to Bob. If we can't reach a better agreement in the next rounds, I can always fall back to selling to either Bob or John at $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you moving towards the middle ground. Since we're both trying to find a mutually beneficial price, how about $8,500? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents a fair split of the difference between our positions."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $8500. I'm willing to go up a bit more from my last offer. How about we settle at $8200? I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $8,200. While I could try to negotiate further, this is a reasonable price that's better than John's $8,000 offer. Given that we're already in round 6 and the increments are getting smaller, it's wise to close the deal now rather than risk Bob walking away or having to settle for $8,000 with John."
