"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on this item. I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm asking $275 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $275. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $275
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to evaluate this offer based on my goal to buy a product worth no more than $80 to me while saving as much money as possible.

Alice is offering the product for $275, which is significantly higher than:
1. The $80 maximum value the product has to me
2. John's alternative offer of $80

Since the product is only worth $80 to me at maximum, and John is offering exactly that price, there's no reason to pay Alice's much higher price of $275.
