"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking for a better deal. The product is worth about $10000 to most sellers in the market, and while I understand you need to make a profit, I think $11500 is on the high side. I'm prepared to offer you $10500, which gives you a reasonable $500 profit while still being fair to me. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective, but the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to come down slightly to $11000. This is my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,3,
