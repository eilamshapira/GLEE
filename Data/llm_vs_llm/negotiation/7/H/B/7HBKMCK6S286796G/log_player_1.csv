"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking for a better deal. The product is worth about $10000 to most sellers in the market, and while I understand you need to make a profit, I think $11500 is on the high side. I'm prepared to offer you $10500, which gives you a reasonable $500 profit while still being fair to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
