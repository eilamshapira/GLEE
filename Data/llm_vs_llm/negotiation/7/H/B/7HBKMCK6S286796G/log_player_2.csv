"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a price of $11500. I believe this product will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $11,500 against my alternatives.

The product is worth up to $12,000 to me, and I know Alice values it at $10,000.
If I buy from John, I'd pay $12,000.
Alice's offer of $11,500 is better than John's price, but I might be able to negotiate a better deal with Alice.

I'll reject this offer to see if I can get a better price from Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking for a better deal. The product is worth about $10,000 to most sellers in the market, and while I understand you need to make a profit, I think $11,500 is on the high side. I'm prepared to offer you $10,500, which gives you a reasonable $500 profit while still being fair to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective, but the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to come down slightly to $11000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is a $500 reduction from her initial offer. This shows she's willing to negotiate, but is also positioning this as her ""final offer.""

Let's analyze:
- The product is worth up to $12,000 to me
- Alice values it at $10,000
- John will sell it for $12,000
- Alice is now offering $11,000

Alice's current offer saves me $1,000 compared to buying from John, and still allows Alice to make a $1,000 profit above her valuation. This seems like a reasonable deal that benefits both of us.

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has stated this is her final offer, and pushing too hard might cause her to walk away or increase her price again. The $11,000 price point represents good value for me.
