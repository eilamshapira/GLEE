Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $11,000 is already close to my maximum budget of $12,000, I'll consider rejecting the offer to see if I can get a better deal. However, I won't buy from John just yet, as I want to explore the possibility of getting an even lower price from Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, to gauge her willingness to negotiate. Since I don't know the value of the product to Alice, I'll start with a relatively low offer.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $10,000 is more appealing, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since she was willing to lower the price by $1,000 from her initial offer, I'll try to negotiate further.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice's previous offer was $10,000, and I'm trying to get the best deal possible. I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one, to show that I'm willing to compromise.
