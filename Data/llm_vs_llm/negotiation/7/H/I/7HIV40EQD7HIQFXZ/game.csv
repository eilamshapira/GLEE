"Hi Alice, $25000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $18000 at this time. What do you think?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $25000 might be a little high for your initial budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $18000 is less than I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $21500?",21500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $21500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  How about $20000? That's closer to where I need to be.",20000.0,Bob,4,
