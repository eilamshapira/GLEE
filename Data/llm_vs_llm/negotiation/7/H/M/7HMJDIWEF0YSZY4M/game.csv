"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is way too high for me. The product is worth significantly less in the current market. I'm willing to offer $700000, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Okay, Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to negotiate. While $700000 is too low, I'm eager to reach an agreement. Considering the unique value of the product, I'm willing to reduce the price to $1800000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
