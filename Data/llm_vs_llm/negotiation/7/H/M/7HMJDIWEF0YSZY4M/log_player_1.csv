"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is way too high for me. The product is worth significantly less in the current market. I'm willing to offer $700000, which I believe is a fair price considering market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Considering Bob's offer of $700,000, which is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and my ability to sell the product to John for $1,200,000 right now, I will reject Bob's offer.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to negotiate. While $700,000 is too low, I'm eager to reach an agreement. Considering the unique value of the product, I'm willing to reduce the price to **$1,800,000**. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts.
