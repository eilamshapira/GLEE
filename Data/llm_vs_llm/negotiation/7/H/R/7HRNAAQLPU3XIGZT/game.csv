"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $2000000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $600000 for the product. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $600000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to consider a price of $1800000. Let me know what you think.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $2000000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the value this product can bring justifies a higher investment. How about we settle on $1800000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $1800000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $700000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. Let me know if this works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your increased offer, Bob. However, $700000 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $1600000, which I believe is a fair compromise given the value of the product. What are your thoughts on this?",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I need to maintain a certain value for this product. Let's meet in the middle at $1600000. This is a substantial reduction from my previous offers and reflects my desire to reach an agreement with you. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1600000 is still beyond what I can justify. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750000. This is my final stretch before considering other options. Let me know if we can close the deal at this price.",750000.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but $750000 is still not feasible for me. I'm willing to lower my price further to $1400000, which is a significant concession on my part. This is my best and final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this works for you.",,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're trying to find a middle ground here. I'm willing to lower my price to $1400000, which is a substantial reduction from my previous offers. This is my best and final offer before I consider other options. Let me know if this works for you.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle, but $1400000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $780000, which is very close to my maximum budget. This is my final offer before I have to consider other options. Let me know if we can agree on this price.",780000.0,Bob,8,
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but $780000 is still below my minimum threshold. Since we are unable to reach an agreement, I will have to consider other options. Thank you for your time.",,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but I need to maintain a certain value for this product. Given that we are nearing the end of our negotiation, I'm willing to lower my price to $1300000 as a final attempt to reach an agreement. This is my last offer before I have to consider other options. Let me know if this works for you.",1300000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is our last round. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is the absolute maximum I can offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to buy from another seller. Let me know if we can close the deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,10,
"Bob, thank you for your final offer, but $800000 is still below my minimum threshold. Since we are unable to reach an agreement, I will sell the product to another buyer, John, for $1200000. It was a pleasure negotiating with you, and I hope we can do business in the future.",,Alice,10,SellToJhon
