Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed fallback of $800,000 from John
3. Bob will reject if the price is too high
4. Bob should accept if he can make a profit

I'll price it significantly below Bob's valuation to make it attractive, but well above my minimum value to maximize my profit. A price around $1,200,000 would give Bob a $300,000 profit incentive while giving me a strong return.
