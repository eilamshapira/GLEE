Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Okay, I analyze the situation. My cost is $100, and Bob's offer is $80. Selling to Bob at this price would lead to a loss. Selling to John will give me $100. 

Therefore:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
