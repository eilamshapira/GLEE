"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, I don't want to pay $150. I also have the option to buy it from John for $100, which is within my budget. However, I'd like to try to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm willing to pay up to $100, I'll start by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's offer.
