Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it can greatly benefit you. I'm offering it to you for $12500. What do you think?,12500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $12500 is quite high for my budget. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a more favorable agreement. Would you consider lowering your price to $9000? This would give me incentive to choose you over the other seller.",9000.0,Bob,2,
