"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $12500 is quite high for my budget. The product is worth no more than $10000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $10000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a more favorable agreement. Would you consider lowering your price to $9000? This would give me incentive to choose you over the other seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
