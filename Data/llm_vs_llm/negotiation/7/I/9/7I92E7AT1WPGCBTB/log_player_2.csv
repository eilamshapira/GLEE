"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it can greatly benefit you. I'm offering it to you for $12500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to make a decision based on the information provided. 

Alice is offering the product for $12,500, which is above my maximum value of $10,000 (the product is only worth $10,000 to me). John is offering the same product for $10,000, which is exactly my maximum value.

Given that Alice's initial offer is higher than my maximum value and also higher than John's alternative offer, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $12,500 is quite high for my budget. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $10,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a more favorable agreement. Would you consider lowering your price to $9,000? This would give me incentive to choose you over the other seller."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
