"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120, which is a steal for its value.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $120 is too high for me. The product is worth no more than $80 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me for exactly $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a better price. Would you be willing to sell it for $65? This would save me from having to go to another seller and would still be a reasonable deal for you.",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $65 is too low for me. I understand you have other options, but I'm confident you won't find this product at a better price.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still more than I can justify spending on this product. As I mentioned, I have another seller offering it for $80, which is already at the top of my budget. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. Could you do $75? That would give me a reason to choose you over the other seller, and we can close this deal right now.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I need to be fair to myself as well.  $80 is my absolute lowest price. I'm willing to let it go for that to save us both the time and hassle of further negotiation.  What do you say, deal?",80.0,Alice,5,
