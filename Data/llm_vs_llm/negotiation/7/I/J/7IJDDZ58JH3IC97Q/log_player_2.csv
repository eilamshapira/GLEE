"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120, which is a steal for its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to consider my options here. Alice is offering the product for $120, but it's worth at most $80 to me. Meanwhile, John is willing to sell it for $80, which is the maximum I'd value this product.

Alice's offer of $120 is significantly higher than my maximum value and higher than John's alternative price. There's no reason for me to accept this offer when I can either negotiate for a better price or simply buy from John at my maximum value.

Since I have the option to negotiate, I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can get a better deal before defaulting to John's $80 price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $120 is too high for me. The product is worth no more than $80 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it to me for exactly $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a better price. Would you be willing to sell it for $65? This would save me from having to go to another seller and would still be a reasonable deal for you."", ""product_price"": 65}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $65 is too low for me. I understand you have other options, but I'm confident you won't find this product at a better price.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $95 is still higher than both my maximum value for the product ($80) and John's alternative price ($80). There's no reason for me to accept this offer when I can get the same product for less from John.

I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal below $80. If Alice won't come down enough, I can always buy from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still more than I can justify spending on this product. As I mentioned, I have another seller offering it for $80, which is already at the top of my budget. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. Could you do $75? That would give me a reason to choose you over the other seller, and we can close this deal right now."", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I need to be fair to myself as well.  $80 is my absolute lowest price. I'm willing to let it go for that to save us both the time and hassle of further negotiation.  What do you say, deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has now offered the product at $80, which matches both my maximum value for the product and John's alternative price. At this point, there's no advantage to continuing negotiations since Alice has stated this is her ""absolute lowest price"" and it matches the alternative option.

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price of $80, and there's no indication I could get it for less, I'll accept Alice's offer rather than continuing to negotiate or switching to John.
