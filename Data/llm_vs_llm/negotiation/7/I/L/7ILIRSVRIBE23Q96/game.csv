"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $10000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product sounds interesting, $10000 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider $6000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $8500?  This is a very high-quality product, and I think you'll find it worth the investment.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks Alice, $8500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, how about $7000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $7000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to compromise, how about $7500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product.",7500.0,Alice,5,
