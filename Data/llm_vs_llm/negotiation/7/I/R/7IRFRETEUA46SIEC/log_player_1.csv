"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its worth to me."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you, Alice, for the offer. However, I was thinking of a price point that is a bit lower. How about we settle for $800000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $800,000 because it's significantly lower than the product's worth to me and to Bob. Since Bob is willing to pay up to $1,200,000, I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial price. I'll proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you, Bob, for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's discuss a price that reflects the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was hoping for a lower price. Let's settle for $900000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $900,000. Although it's getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, I still believe the product is worth more, especially since Bob has indicated he's willing to pay up to $1,200,000. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is becoming a more attractive option, but I'd like to try to negotiate a better price with Bob first. I'll proceed to make another counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you, Bob, for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price. However, I'm still looking for a price that better reflects the product's value. Considering your last offer and my previous one, I'm willing to slightly adjust my price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $950,000. We are indeed getting closer to a mutually agreeable price, but I'm still holding out for a better offer. Since Bob's offer is now very close to John's offer of $1,000,000, I need to carefully consider my next move. I'll make another counteroffer, trying to nudge Bob closer to my target price while still being competitive with John's offer."

I'm glad we're getting closer, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Considering your last offer and the product's value, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. Let's try $975,000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 975000}"
