"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $10000 is quite steep for this product. Given current market conditions and comparable offerings, I would be willing to pay $7000 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. However, considering the value and quality of the product, I'm willing to lower the price to $9000. This is still a competitive offer and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
