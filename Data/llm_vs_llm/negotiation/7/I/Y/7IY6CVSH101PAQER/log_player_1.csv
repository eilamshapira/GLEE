Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $10000 is quite steep for this product. Given current market conditions and comparable offerings, I would be willing to pay $7000 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
