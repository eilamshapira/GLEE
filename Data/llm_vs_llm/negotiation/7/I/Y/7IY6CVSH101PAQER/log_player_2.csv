"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $10000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-value item at a competitive rate. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice is offering the product for $10,000, which is $2,000 more than my maximum value ($8,000) and also $2,000 more than John's price ($8,000), it would not be rational to accept this offer. 

Given that John is willing to sell the product for $8,000, I can either try to negotiate with Alice to get a better price or go with John's guaranteed offer. Since Alice's initial offer is significantly above my maximum value and John's price, I should try to negotiate with Alice first by making a counteroffer. If the negotiation doesn't work out, I can always fall back on John's offer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $10,000 is quite steep for this product. Given current market conditions and comparable offerings, I would be willing to pay $7,000 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. However, considering the value and quality of the product, I'm willing to lower the price to $9000. This is still a competitive offer and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $9,000 is still above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). There's no reason to accept a price that's higher than what I can get from John. Since Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing the price from $10,000 to $9,000, I could try one more counteroffer. However, since John is offering $8,000 (which is equal to my maximum value), and Alice is still significantly above that, it would be more rational at this point to take John's guaranteed offer rather than continue negotiating.
