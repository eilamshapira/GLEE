"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be an excellent investment for you. Given its market value and potential, I'm offering it at $1150000. This price represents a fair value for both parties, considering the product's worth.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're offering, I believe your asking price is a bit high considering the market conditions. The product is worth $1000000 to you, and I'd like to propose a more balanced deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1050000 for the product, which would give you a reasonable profit while allowing me to stay within my budget constraints.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to point out that this product has significant value in the current market. While I understand your budget constraints, my price needs to reflect the product's true worth. I'm willing to adjust my initial offer and propose $1120000, which still represents good value given the product's market position and potential returns.",1120000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I need to be practical about this purchase. Your product is worth $1000000 to you, and while I recognize you need to make a profit, I also need to make a sensible business decision. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1080000, which gives you an $80000 profit - a very reasonable 8% return. This is substantially better than my previous offer and represents significant movement on my part. Keep in mind that I do have the option to purchase from John at $1200000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a fair agreement.",1080000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and the progress we're making in our negotiation. While your offer of $1080000 shows good faith, I know this product will provide significant value to you. You mentioned the possibility of purchasing from John at $1200000, which indicates the product's true worth to you. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1100000, which would still give you substantial value while providing me with a fair return.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
