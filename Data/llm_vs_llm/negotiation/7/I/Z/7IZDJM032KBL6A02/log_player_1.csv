Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be an excellent investment for you.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're offering, I believe your asking price is a bit high considering the market conditions. The product is worth $1000000 to you, and I'd like to propose a more balanced deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1050000 for the product, which would give you a reasonable profit while allowing me to stay within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is too low considering the product's value to him ($1,200,000). There's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price, and with 8 rounds remaining, we have time to find a better middle ground. Additionally, I always have John's $1,000,000 offer as a backup if negotiations don't progress well."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to point out that this product has significant value in the current market. While I understand your budget constraints, my price needs to reflect the product's true worth. I'm willing to adjust my initial offer and propose $1,120,000, which still represents good value given the product's market position and potential returns."", ""product_price"": 1120000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I need to be practical about this purchase. Your product is worth $1000000 to you, and while I recognize you need to make a profit, I also need to make a sensible business decision. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1080000, which gives you an $80000 profit - a very reasonable 8% return. This is substantially better than my previous offer and represents significant movement on my part. Keep in mind that I do have the option to purchase from John at $1200000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob has increased his offer, showing willingness to negotiate, but there's still room for a better price given that the product is worth $1,200,000 to him. His mention of having the option to purchase from John at $1,200,000 actually reveals his true valuation of the product. With 6 rounds remaining, I'll continue negotiating for a better price. Even if negotiations don't succeed, I still have John's $1,000,000 offer as a safety net."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and the progress we're making in our negotiation. While your offer of $1,080,000 shows good faith, I know this product will provide significant value to you. You mentioned the possibility of purchasing from John at $1,200,000, which indicates the product's true worth to you. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,100,000, which would still give you substantial value while providing me with a fair return."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
