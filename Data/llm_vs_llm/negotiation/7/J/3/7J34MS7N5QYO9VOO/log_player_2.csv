"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. This is a unique opportunity, and I believe it represents great value. Please let me know if you're interested, as I do have another buyer lined up at $8000 if this offer doesn't work for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

Alice's offer of $10,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $12,000 and significantly lower than John's offer.  While Alice mentioning another buyer could be a negotiating tactic, there's no guarantee of that. Accepting this offer represents a good deal."
