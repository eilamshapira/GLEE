Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $180."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer because:
1. Bob's offer of $60 is way below my minimum acceptable price of $150
2. I still have John's guaranteed offer of $150
3. There might be room to negotiate with Bob, but I need to significantly raise the price from $60"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is far too low for this product. Given its quality and value, I cannot go below $165. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 165}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the reduction from $180 to $165, but it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. Would you consider selling the product for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I choose to sell to John because:
1. Bob's offer of $80 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $150
2. Based on Bob's two offers ($60 and $80), it seems unlikely he'll reach a price above $150
3. John's guaranteed offer of $150 is the best option, as it meets my minimum price and ensures I don't lose value through further negotiations"
