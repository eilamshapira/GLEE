"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm asking $250 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice is offering the product for $250, but it's only worth $120 to me at most. John is willing to sell the same product for $120, which matches my maximum value.

Since Alice's price ($250) is significantly higher than both my valuation and John's alternative price, the economically rational choice is clear.
