"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. After careful consideration of the market value and the unique benefits it offers, I'm offering it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price for a product of this quality and utility. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Looking at this offer carefully: 

Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is $400,000 more than the product is worth to me ($800,000). It's also $400,000 more than what John is selling it for.

Since John is offering the exact same product at $800,000, which matches exactly the maximum I'm willing to pay, there's no reason to accept Alice's much higher offer or to make a counteroffer that might still end up being higher than John's price.
