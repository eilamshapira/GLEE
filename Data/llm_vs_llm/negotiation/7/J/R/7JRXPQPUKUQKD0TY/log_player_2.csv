"Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer ($17,500) is higher than both my maximum valuation ($15,000) and John's price ($15,000), it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. The best choice is to buy from John at $15,000.
