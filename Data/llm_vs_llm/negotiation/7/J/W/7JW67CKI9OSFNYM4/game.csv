"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a price of $20000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a great asset for you.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering me as the first buyer. However, I think $20000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to make a serious offer of $6000, which I believe is a fair price for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the product's value is considerably higher.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7500, which is the highest I'm comfortable with at this point. I believe it's a reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $7500 is closer to what you're looking for, I can't let it go for less than $10000.  This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, reflecting my desire to find a deal that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
