Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $20,000. I know this is a significant investment, but I truly believe in the value of this product and I am confident it will be highly beneficial for you."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a price that's profitable for you. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the high price, even if it's emphasizing the product's value, can make the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer. This opens up a dialogue and allows me to gauge his interest level. 

**Important Note:** My safety net is John, who will buy the product for $15,000. I don't want to go below this price unless absolutely necessary."
