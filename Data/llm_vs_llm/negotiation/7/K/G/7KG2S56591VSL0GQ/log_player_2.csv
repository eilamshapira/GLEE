"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $119. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Looking at Alice's offer, she is asking for $119 for the product. Since this product is only worth up to $100 to me, and John is willing to sell me the same product for $100, it makes financial sense to go with John's offer.

Alice's price ($119) is $19 more than what I value the product at, and $19 more than John's price.
