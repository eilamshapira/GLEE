"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000 and also higher than John's offer of $8,000, it wouldn't be rational to accept Alice's offer. Given that John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value point ($8,000), and it's a guaranteed option, I should take that option.
