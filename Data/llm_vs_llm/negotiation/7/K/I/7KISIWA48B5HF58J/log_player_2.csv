"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product holds great value for you, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns. I'm offering it to you at $1400000, a price that reflects its potential while leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal. This is a limited-time offer, so let me know your decision as soon as possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation.  You know John will sell it to you for $1,500,000, but seeing if Alice will go lower is worth a shot."
