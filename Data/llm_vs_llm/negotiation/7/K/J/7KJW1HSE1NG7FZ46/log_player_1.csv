Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth a premium price, and I'm willing to let it go for $140."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $60 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me, I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Selling to John for $120 is an option, but I want to try to negotiate a better price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and lower the price from my initial offer. I can let it go for $130."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my previous offer and meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $70 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $70 is still lower than the product's worth to me, and it's also lower than what John is willing to pay. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, trying to get closer to a price that's acceptable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $70 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to lower the price again, but I need to get closer to a price that reflects the product's value. I can let it go for $125."", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to lower the price. However, $125 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer again, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to offer $75 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $75 is still significantly lower than the product's worth to me, and it's also lower than what John is willing to pay. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. However, I'm starting to think that Bob may not be willing to meet me at a price that's acceptable to me, so I may need to consider selling to John soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $75 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get close to a price that reflects the product's value. I can let it go for $120, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price to $120, which I understand is the lowest you're comfortable with. However, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer, which is the highest I'm comfortable with. I'd like to offer $80 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer of $80 is the highest he's willing to go, but it's still $40 less than what John is willing to pay. Since I've already lowered my price to $120, which is the lowest I'm comfortable with, and Bob is still not willing to meet me at that price, I think it's time to sell the product to John for $120. This way, I can ensure that I get a price that reflects the product's value to me."
