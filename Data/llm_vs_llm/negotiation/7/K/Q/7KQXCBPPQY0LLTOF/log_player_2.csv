"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer ($200) is higher than both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150), it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. John's price matches my maximum value, and is $50 less than Alice's offer.

The logical choice is to buy from John.
