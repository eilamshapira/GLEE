(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer of $150 is above my budget of $120, I will reject the offer. I still want to try to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a relatively low offer.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $140 is still above my budget of $120, but it's getting closer. I'm not willing to pay $140, but I'm also not ready to give up on negotiating with Alice yet. I'll reject the offer again and try to make another counteroffer to see if we can get even closer to my target price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $140, I'll try to meet her halfway between her offer and my previous counteroffer of $100. I'll make a new counteroffer of $110, which is still below my maximum budget of $120, but shows that I'm willing to compromise.
