,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $600000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",600000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $600000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1800000, considering your interest in the product. Let me know if this works for you.",1800000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to ensure we get a fair value for our product. I'm willing to lower the price further to $1700000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it reflects a good balance between your needs and our minimum requirements. What are your thoughts on this offer?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $1700000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $700000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this proposal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. However, $700000 is still below our minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway and reduce the price to $1600000. This is the lowest I can go while still ensuring we meet our business needs. Please let me know if this works for you.",1600000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. I'm willing to further adjust the price to $1550000. This is a significant concession on our part, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $1550000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $750000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise considering the value of the product. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",750000.0,Bob,6,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $750000 is still not feasible for us. I'm willing to lower our price to $1525000, which is very close to our minimum threshold. This is our final offer before we consider other options. Please let me know if this works for you.",1525000.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close to finding a solution. I'm willing to make one last adjustment to $1510000. This is our absolute bottom line, and we cannot go any lower. Please consider this offer carefully as it's our final one before we have to explore other options.",1510000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your candor about this being your final offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1510000. Considering you've mentioned this is your bottom line, I'm willing to make a more significant concession. I'll increase my offer to $775000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",775000.0,Bob,8,
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal, but your offer of $775000 is still far below our minimum acceptable price. Given the circumstances, I will have to sell the product to another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1500000. Thank you for your interest, and I hope we can do business in the future.",,Alice,8,SellToJhon
