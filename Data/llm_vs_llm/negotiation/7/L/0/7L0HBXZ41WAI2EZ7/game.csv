"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $2000000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. I'm willing to make a concession, but I still believe the product is worth more than your offer. Let me know if we can meet in the middle.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1800000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000. This is the best I can do while staying within my budget. Let me know if this works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make another concession and meet you closer to the middle. I can offer the product to you for $1500000. If this doesn't work, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1500000 is still above what I can afford. I'm prepared to offer $1150000, which is my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider purchasing from another seller. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
