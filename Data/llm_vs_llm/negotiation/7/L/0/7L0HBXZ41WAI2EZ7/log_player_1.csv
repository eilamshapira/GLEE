Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $2000000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is lower than what John is willing to pay ($1,200,000), and it's also lower than the product's value to me, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better price. My next offer will be lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer and John's offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1800000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000. This is the best I can do while staying within my budget. Let me know if this works for you.

Since Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still lower than what John is willing to pay ($1,200,000), I will reject Bob's offer. However, I notice that Bob is increasing his offer, which means he is willing to negotiate. I will try to meet him in the middle, but I will not go below John's offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price.

This option guarantees me a higher price than Bob's offer, and I don't want to risk losing the sale or negotiating further with Bob."
