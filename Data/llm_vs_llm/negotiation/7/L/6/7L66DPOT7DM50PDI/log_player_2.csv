"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I am offering it to you for $2500000. This is a rare opportunity to acquire something truly special. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer against my constraints and alternatives.

Alice is offering the product for $2,500,000, which exceeds my maximum valuation of $1,000,000. Additionally, I have the option to buy the same product from John for $1,000,000, which is within my budget constraint.

Since Alice's price is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation and the alternative offer from John, the rational decision is to choose option 3.
