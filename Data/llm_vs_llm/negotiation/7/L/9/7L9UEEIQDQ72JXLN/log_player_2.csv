"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Since all options lead to paying $10,000 for the product, and that matches my maximum value for it, I might as well accept Alice's offer. There's no advantage to rejecting it or buying from John since the price is the same."
