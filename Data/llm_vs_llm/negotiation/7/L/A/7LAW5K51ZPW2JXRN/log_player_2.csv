"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative price ($8,000). It would be illogical to accept this offer. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice. If negotiations don't progress favorably, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $6,000. This is below both my maximum value and John's price, giving me room to negotiate upward if necessary. It's also significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $15,000, but not so low as to be completely unreasonable. This leaves space for back-and-forth negotiation while still potentially allowing me to get a better deal than John's $8,000 price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $14,500 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). The minimal reduction from her initial offer ($15,000 to $14,500) suggests she might not be willing to negotiate down to a reasonable price quickly. However, I'll reject and make another counteroffer to see if we can make more substantial progress. If Alice continues with minimal reductions, I can always take John's offer later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6500}

I'll increase my previous offer slightly to $6,500. Since Alice only reduced her price by $500 (from $15,000 to $14,500), I'll also make a modest increase to my previous offer to show some willingness to negotiate, but still maintain a position well below my maximum value. This gives me room to continue negotiating while still potentially securing a better deal than John's $8,000 offer. If Alice continues to make only minimal concessions, I may need to consider taking John's offer in the upcoming rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'm choosing to buy from John for $8,000 because:
1. Alice's negotiation pattern shows very small decrements ($500 each time, from $15,000 to $14,500 to $14,000)
2. At this rate, it would take many more rounds to even approach my maximum value of $8,000
3. We've already used half of our available negotiation rounds
4. Alice's current offer ($14,000) is still $6,000 above my maximum value
5. John's offer of $8,000 is guaranteed and matches my maximum value

Given these factors, it's better to secure the deal with John now rather than risk more rounds with Alice when she seems unlikely to reach an acceptable price."
