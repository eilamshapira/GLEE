"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $13500. This price reflects the product's true worth while still providing you with good value.",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to counter with $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While I understand budget constraints, $11000 is too low considering the product's value. I can come down from my initial price to $12500, which I believe is a fair compromise and still represents good value for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still working within a tight budget. Could you consider $11500? I think this would be a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you moving up on your offer. I can see you're interested in reaching a deal, and I am too. Let's meet in the middle at $12000. This is a significant reduction from my initial asking price and represents excellent value given the product's worth. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
