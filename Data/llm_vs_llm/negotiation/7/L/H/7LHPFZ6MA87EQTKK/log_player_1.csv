Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $13,500.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to counter with $11000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer because $11,000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and I know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a better price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still working within a tight budget. Could you consider $11500? I think this would be a fair price for both of us.

I'll make another counteroffer because while Bob is moving up in price, there's still room for negotiation. The $11,500 offer is better but still leaves significant money on the table given that the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. I'll try one more time to reach a middle ground."

I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
