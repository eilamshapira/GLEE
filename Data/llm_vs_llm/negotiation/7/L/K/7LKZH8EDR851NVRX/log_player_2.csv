"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $9,500 is close to my maximum budget of $10,000, but I still have room to negotiate and potentially save some money, I'll choose to reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, I'll start by offering a price that is slightly higher than that, to leave room for further negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $9,200 is a slight decrease from her initial offer, but it's still close to my maximum budget. Since I know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to make a more reasonable counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 2, I offered $8,500, which was rejected by Alice. Now, I'll try to meet Alice halfway between my previous offer and her new offer of $9,200. I'll make a counteroffer of $8,800, which is slightly higher than my previous offer, but still lower than Alice's current offer.
