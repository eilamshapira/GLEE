"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing it's likely Bob won't accept this first offer. It gives me room to negotiate down without feeling like I'm giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm eager to make a sale,  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum threshold.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still leaving room for negotiation.  $13,000 is a fair price,  as it's a significant increase for Bob while still allowing me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum,  $9,500 is still too low.  I'll make another counteroffer, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This is my final attempt to negotiate with Bob. I'm lowering the price to $12,000, which is still a good profit for me. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll move on to selling to John."
