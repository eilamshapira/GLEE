"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: Alice's offer of $17,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's alternative offer ($10,000). It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer as I would be losing money. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, as there's potential to negotiate with Alice for a better price, though I always have John's $10,000 offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9000}

Rationale: I'll start with a counteroffer of $9,000 because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $10,000
2. It's below John's alternative offer of $10,000
3. While it's well below Alice's initial offer of $17,000 and below her cost of $15,000, it serves as an anchor for further negotiation
4. Even if Alice rejects this (which is likely since it's below her cost), it gives room for negotiation upward while still keeping the final price potentially below John's offer
5. We have several rounds remaining to reach a mutually acceptable price, so starting low gives more room for negotiation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: While Alice has significantly reduced her price from $17,000 to $13,000, this is still above both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's alternative offer ($10,000). There's no reason to accept a price higher than my maximum value when I have a guaranteed option at $10,000 from John. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round. Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing her price substantially, so there might still be room for further negotiation, though I always have John's offer as a backup if we can't reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9500}

Rationale: I'll slightly increase my offer to $9,500 because:
1. It shows some movement from my previous offer of $9,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate
2. It's still below my maximum value of $10,000 and John's price
3. While this is still below Alice's cost ($15,000), Alice's significant drop from $17,000 to $13,000 shows she might be willing to negotiate further
4. If Alice rejects this, I still have 6 more rounds and can always fall back on John's $10,000 offer
5. The small increment in my offer ($500) signals that I won't be making large jumps in price, setting expectations for the negotiation"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Rationale: At this point, I'm choosing to buy from John because:
1. Alice's latest offer ($12,000) is still significantly above John's fixed price ($10,000)
2. Alice's offers, while decreasing ($17,000 → $13,000 → $12,000), are still above my maximum value ($10,000)
3. Given that Alice's cost is $15,000, it's unlikely she'll go below $10,000 in future rounds
4. While we could continue negotiating, there's no indication Alice will drop her price below John's offer
5. It's more economically rational to take John's guaranteed $10,000 offer than to continue negotiations for a potentially higher price"
