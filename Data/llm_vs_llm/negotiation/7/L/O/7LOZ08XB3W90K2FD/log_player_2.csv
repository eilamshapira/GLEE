"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to consider my options here. Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value for the product ($8,000) and also much higher than John's alternative offer of $8,000.

There's no reason to accept Alice's current offer since it exceeds both my valuation and my alternative option. I should either reject and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate to a better price than John's $8,000, or simply buy from John directly.

Since I have the option to buy from John at any time, I'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price first.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's substantially lower than Alice's initial price, but still reasonable enough to start the negotiation process.

{""product_price"": $5,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price from $20,000 to $18,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $18,000 is still significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative offer ($8,000).

There's no reason to accept this offer since it's still much higher than my alternative. I'll reject and continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price below John's $8,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still keep it well below John's price of $8,000 since that's my alternative.

{""product_price"": $6,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price again to $16,000, showing continued willingness to negotiate. However, this is still double the price of John's alternative offer of $8,000, and also exceeds my maximum valuation of $8,000.

There's no reason to accept this offer. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a better price than John's $8,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer again to show good faith in the negotiation, but still keep it below John's price since that's my alternative option.

{""product_price"": $7,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price to $15,000, which shows she's continuing to negotiate, but her reductions are getting smaller. Her current offer is still well above both my maximum valuation and John's alternative offer of $8,000.

Since we're now in Round 7 of 10, and Alice's reductions have been relatively modest so far (from $20,000 to $15,000 across multiple rounds), it seems unlikely that she'll drop below $8,000 in the remaining rounds. 

At this point, I'll reject her offer one more time to make a final counteroffer, but if we can't reach an agreement better than $8,000, I should be prepared to buy from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make one final significant counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal below John's price.

{""product_price"": $7,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer has dropped to $14,000, but this is still significantly higher than John's price of $8,000 and my maximum valuation of $8,000.

We're now in Round 9 of 10, and Alice has only reduced her price by $6,000 total across multiple rounds (from $20,000 to $14,000). Given the pattern of her modest price reductions, it's very unlikely she'll drop below $8,000 in the final round.

At this point, it makes the most sense to buy from John for $8,000, as we've essentially reached an impasse with Alice.
