"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given the product's exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1200000. This price reflects the product's true worth while still leaving room for profitable utilization on your end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I should consider the following:

*   **My maximum willingness to pay:** $1,500,000
*   **Alice's offer:** $1,200,000
*   **Buying from John:** $1,500,000

Since Alice's offer is below my maximum willingness to pay, and it's lower than buying from John, I should accept the offer.
