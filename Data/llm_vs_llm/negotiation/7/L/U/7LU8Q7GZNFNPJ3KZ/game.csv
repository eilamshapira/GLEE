"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $10000 for the product given its features and quality. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I can't go that low considering the product's quality and market value. I can come down to $13500, which I believe is a fair price given the exceptional features and durability this product offers. How does that sound?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget constraints. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $11000. We're getting closer, but I'm still not able to go that low. The product has exceptional value, and I've already reduced my initial price significantly. I can come down to $12500 as my best offer. This represents a substantial discount from my initial price and reflects the true value of this premium product. Would this work for you?",12500.0,Alice,5,
