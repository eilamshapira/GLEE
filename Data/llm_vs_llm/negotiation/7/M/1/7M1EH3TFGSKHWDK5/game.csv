"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2300000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product, considering its value to me. Please let me know if this works for you.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I cannot accept $1200000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value and development costs that I need to recoup. I understand budget constraints, so I'm willing to reduce my initial offer. I can offer it to you for $1950000, which represents a substantial discount from my original price. This is a competitive price for the quality and value you'll receive. Would this work better for your budget?",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $1950000 is still outside of my budget. I understand the value of the product, but I need to stay within my financial limits. I can go up to $1350000. Is this something you can consider?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
