Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I cannot accept $1200000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value and development costs that I need to recoup. I understand budget constraints, so I'm willing to reduce my initial offer. I can offer it to you for $1950000, which represents a substantial discount from my original price. This is a competitive price for the quality and value you'll receive. Would this work better for your budget?
