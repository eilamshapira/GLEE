Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, Bob, let's start this negotiation. I have a truly unique and valuable product here. Given its potential, I'm looking for a price that reflects its worth.

Here's my initial offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","That's quite a low offer from Bob. The product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me. I can't accept $800,000.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright Bob, $800,000 is too low. I understand you are trying to get a good deal, but I need to be realistic about the value here. How about we meet closer to the middle of what I think it's worth and your offer.

```json
