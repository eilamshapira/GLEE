"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to carefully consider this offer from Alice. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, so accepting Alice's offer of $1,800,000 would be a poor decision - I'd be paying $600,000 more than the product is worth to me.

I also know that John is willing to sell me the product for $1,200,000, which is exactly what the product is worth to me. However, I should try to negotiate with Alice first to see if I can get a better price.

Since Alice's initial offer is much higher than my maximum value, I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that leaves room for negotiation while being reasonable compared to what I'm willing to pay.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price from $1,800,000 to $1,600,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this price is still $400,000 above my maximum value of $1,200,000, and it's also higher than John's guaranteed price of $1,200,000.

There's no reason for me to accept this offer when I have a better alternative. I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer somewhat to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'll stay well below John's price since that's my alternative.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has further reduced her price to $1,450,000, which shows continued willingness to negotiate. However, this is still $250,000 more than John's price of $1,200,000.

Since Alice's offer is still higher than my alternative option, and higher than the maximum value of the product to me, I should reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer again to show good faith in the negotiation, but I'll stay below my maximum value and John's price.

{""product_price"": $1,050,000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price to $1,350,000, which is still $150,000 higher than John's price of $1,200,000. Since I have the option to buy from John at $1,200,000, which is exactly my maximum value for the product, there's no reason for me to accept Alice's current offer.

I'll reject this offer and make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal below John's price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make my final serious offer to Alice. Since we're on round 8 of 10, I need to be strategic. I'll offer slightly below John's price to give Alice a chance to beat my alternative.
