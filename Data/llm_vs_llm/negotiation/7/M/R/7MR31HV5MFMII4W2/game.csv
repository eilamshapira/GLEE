"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $11000 is still too high for me. How about we settle at $7000? This is a fair price considering my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see where you're coming from, but I need to maintain a certain value for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? This is the lowest I can go while still valuing the product appropriately.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $10500 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7500. This is my final offer within my budget. Let me know if this works for you.",7500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I need to stay firm on the value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $10000, which is a significant reduction from my original offer. This is the best I can do. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Alice,7,
