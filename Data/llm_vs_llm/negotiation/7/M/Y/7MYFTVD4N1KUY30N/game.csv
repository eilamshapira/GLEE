"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints.",8000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. However, $8000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $18000? This price reflects the value of the product while considering your budget constraints.",18000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. Let's settle on $15000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and should be more within your budget while still reflecting the product's worth.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price, but $15000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering my budget and the fact that I have alternative options, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9500. This price reflects a compromise between your reduced offer and my initial budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, $9500 is still below my minimum threshold. Let's try to close the gap further. How about $12000? This price is a fair compromise and reflects the value of the product.",12000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to reach a fair agreement. Given your latest offer and my need to maintain a certain value for the product, I propose we settle at $11000. This price is closer to your budget and still respects the product's worth.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and the price reduction to $11000. However, I'm still aiming to stay within a tighter budget. Since I have the option to purchase the product from another seller for $10000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. This price is competitive and reflects the market value I've discovered.",10000.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, I appreciate your transparency and the competitive offer. Given the circumstances and your willingness to meet at $10000, I accept your offer. Let's proceed with the sale at this price.",,Alice,6,AcceptOffer
