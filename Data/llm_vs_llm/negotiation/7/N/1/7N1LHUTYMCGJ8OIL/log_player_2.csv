"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in purchasing the product. My initial offer is $1300000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer ($1,300,000) is higher than both my maximum value ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), it makes no sense to accept this offer. While I could reject and make a counteroffer, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice when I can get the product at my maximum acceptable price from John right away.
