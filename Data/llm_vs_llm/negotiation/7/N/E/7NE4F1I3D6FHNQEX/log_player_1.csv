Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to offer a price to Bob that maximizes my profit while ensuring I don't lose the sale if Bob values it significantly higher than my $800,000 minimum. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'll need to balance the risk of setting the price too high (and Bob rejecting) versus setting it too low and leaving money on the table.

Given that I have a guaranteed fallback option with John at $800,000, I can afford to be somewhat aggressive with my offer to Bob, knowing I won't end up with less than my minimum value.
