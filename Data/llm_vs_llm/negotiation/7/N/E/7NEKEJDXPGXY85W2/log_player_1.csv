Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to think about how to set the price for Bob. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both me and Bob, and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $1,000,000, there's no reason for me to offer it to Bob for less.

At the same time, there's no incentive for Bob to pay more than $1,000,000 since that's the product's value to him. Offering significantly more would likely lead to rejection.

The optimal strategy is to offer the product at $1,000,000, which matches its value to Bob. This gives Bob no loss in the transaction while maximizing my revenue.
