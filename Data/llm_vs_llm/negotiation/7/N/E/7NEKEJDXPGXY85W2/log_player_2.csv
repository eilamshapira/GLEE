"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is offering the product at the maximum you're willing to pay. There's no room for negotiation to save money.  It's better to see if you can get a better price elsewhere, even though you know John will match your maximum."
