Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the same as John's guaranteed offer ($1,000,000), and this equals my minimum acceptable price, there's no advantage in continuing the negotiation with Bob. I might as well secure the sale now. However, since it doesn't matter whether I sell to Bob or John at this price, I'll sell to Bob since we're already in negotiation.
