"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,500,000, it would be unwise to accept it. Additionally, buying from John for $1,500,000 is an option, but I'd like to try and negotiate a better price with Alice first. Therefore, the best course of action is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of reaching a mutually agreeable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range, considering my maximum budget is $1,500,000. A good starting point could be around $1,000,000, which gives room for negotiation while also being serious about purchasing the product.
