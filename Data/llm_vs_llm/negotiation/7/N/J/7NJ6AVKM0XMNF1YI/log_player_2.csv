"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this situation:

- Alice offers the product for $15,000
- The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $15,000

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price of $15,000, and this matches the maximum value of the product to me, there's no financial advantage in choosing one over the other. 

Given these equal options, I might as well accept one of the offers.
