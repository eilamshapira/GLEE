"Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to acquire this unique and valuable asset. I believe it could significantly benefit your portfolio. I'm initially offering it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product. However, after careful consideration, I believe $950000 would be a more reasonable price. This is still a substantial amount that reflects the product's value, while being more aligned with my budget constraints. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective and budget considerations. While $950000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with at this stage, I'm willing to come down somewhat. How about we meet in the middle at $1100000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Your movement on the price shows we're making progress. While $1100000 is getting closer to what I had in mind, I think $1025000 would be a fair compromise that works for both of us. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my serious interest in closing this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I acknowledge your increased offer and continued interest. I'm getting closer to a point where I need to seriously consider alternative buyers. Let's try this: I'll come down to $1075000. This is the lowest I can go for now.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
