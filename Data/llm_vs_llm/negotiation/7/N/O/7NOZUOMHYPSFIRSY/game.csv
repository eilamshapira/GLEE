"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $17000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  This is a fair price given its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000, considering the product's value and my initial investment. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair return.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $14000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects a genuine desire to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and yours, which would be $13000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",13000.0,Alice,5,
