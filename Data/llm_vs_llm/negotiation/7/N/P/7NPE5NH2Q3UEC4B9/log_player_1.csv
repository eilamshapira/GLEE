Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, the price of $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
