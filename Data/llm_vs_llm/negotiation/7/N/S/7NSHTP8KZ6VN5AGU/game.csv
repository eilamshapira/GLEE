"Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. It's a high-quality item and I think it would be a great fit for you. My initial price is $250.",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the high quality of your product, $250 is significantly outside my budget. Based on my research and what I'm willing to spend, I could offer $60 for the product. This is the price point that would work for me, considering my needs and budget constraints.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $60 is far too low, as the product is worth at least $120 to me. I understand you have a budget, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle-ish? I can offer it to you for $210.",210.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate you sharing that the product is worth at least $120 to you. However, I have another seller offering the same product for $80, and that's really the maximum I'm willing to pay. To make it worth choosing your offer over theirs, I'd need to pay less than that. I can offer $70, which would give you some profit while giving me a reason to choose your product over the other option.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have another offer. However, my product is superior in quality. I cannot match the other seller's price, but I can come down a bit more. How about $180? This is the lowest I can realistically go considering the value and quality you're getting.",180.0,Alice,5,
