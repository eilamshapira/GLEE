Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the high quality of your product, $250 is significantly outside my budget. Based on my research and what I'm willing to spend, I could offer $60 for the product. This is the price point that would work for me, considering my needs and budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $60 is far too low, as the product is worth at least $120 to me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate you sharing that the product is worth at least $120 to you. However, I have another seller offering the same product for $80, and that's really the maximum I'm willing to pay. To make it worth choosing your offer over theirs, I'd need to pay less than that. I can offer $70, which would give you some profit while giving me a reason to choose your product over the other option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have another offer. However, my product is superior in quality.
