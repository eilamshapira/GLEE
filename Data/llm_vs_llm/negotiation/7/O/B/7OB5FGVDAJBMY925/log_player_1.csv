Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Given that Bob is willing to pay $120, which is better than John's guaranteed $100, and considering Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate from my initial high price, I'll accept his offer.
