"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe could provide great value to you. I'm offering it for $18000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she is asking for $18,000 for the product. However, the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and I can buy the same product from John for exactly $8,000.

Alice's price ($18,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's alternative offer. It would not be rational for me to accept Alice's offer when I have a much better option available.
