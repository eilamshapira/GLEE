"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to evaluate Alice's offer compared to my options.

Alice is offering the product for $200, but it's only worth $150 to me at most. John is willing to sell it for exactly $150, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's price ($200) exceeds what the product is worth to me ($150), and exceeds what I can get it for elsewhere (John's $150), I should not accept Alice's offer.

I could reject and make a counteroffer, but John's guaranteed price of $150 is already at my maximum valuation, so there's no reason to negotiate further when I have a guaranteed option at my limit.
