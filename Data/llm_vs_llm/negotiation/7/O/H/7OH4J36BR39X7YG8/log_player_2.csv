"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. If you're interested, please consider my offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Analyzing the situation:
- The product is worth up to $120 to you
- Alice is offering the product for $100
- John is willing to sell it for $120

Since Alice's offer of $100 is below your maximum value of $120, and it's $20 less than John's price, it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer.
