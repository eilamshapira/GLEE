"Hello Bob, I'm offering a high-quality product that I believe would be very valuable for you. I'd like to propose a selling price of $11500. This represents good value considering the product's worth, while still allowing you to benefit from the purchase.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and the fact that I'm a serious buyer. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, I can't accept $9500 as it's actually below my minimum threshold. I have another buyer willing to pay $10000 for this product, but I'd prefer to work with you. Given the product's true value of at least $12000, I'm willing to come down to $11000, which still gives you a significant value. This is a fair middle ground that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for being transparent about the other buyer's interest. I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a compromise at $10200. I believe this is a fair price, taking into account the product's value and the fact that I'm a serious buyer. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and close the deal.",10200.0,Bob,4,
