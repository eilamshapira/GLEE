Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and the fact that I'm a serious buyer. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, I can't accept $9,500 as it's actually below my minimum threshold. I have another buyer willing to pay $10,000 for this product, but I'd prefer to work with you. Given the product's true value of at least $12,000, I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which still gives you a significant value. This is a fair middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for being transparent about the other buyer's interest. I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a compromise at $10200. I believe this is a fair price, taking into account the product's value and the fact that I'm a serious buyer. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and close the deal.
