"Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $22,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $12,000

The logical choice is to buy from John since:
- It matches my maximum valuation
- It saves me $10,000 compared to Alice's offer
- There's no benefit in accepting Alice's higher price or just rejecting without taking John's offer
