"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m pleased to offer you our exclusive product for $850000. It’s a unique opportunity and a high-quality asset I believe will add significant value. Please let me know at your earliest convenience if you’re interested, as I have another buyer ready at $800000 should you pass on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $850,000 is above my maximum budget of $800,000, and I have the option to buy the product from John for $800,000, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John instead, as it saves me $50,000.
