Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. Given its value, I'm asking for $120.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This first offer will help you understand how much Bob might be willing to pay. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects it, you can always lower the price.
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80. This takes the pressure off and allows you to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob."
