"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to own this product. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. My initial price is $350.",350.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $350 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $50, considering I can also buy it from John for $100.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $50 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It seems you are mistaken about John's offer, as he is only willing to pay $150. I can come down a bit, how about $325?",325.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $325 is still out of my budget. I'm confident that John's offer is $100, not $150. Considering this, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $75. I'm trying to be reasonable, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm afraid there's a misunderstanding about John's offer. He is willing to buy the product for $150. While I appreciate your offer, $75 is too low. Let's try to meet closer to the middle. How about $300?",300.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but $300 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I need you to be more flexible. I'll offer $90, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. If we can't agree on a price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you are persistent, I'll give you that! However, I really can't go that low. You keep mentioning John's offer of $100, but let me assure you, it is $150. Since you like the product, let's keep trying. How about $275?",275.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence as well, but I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more significant increase in my offer. I'll give you $100, which is what I know John is willing to sell it to me for. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to take John up on his deal.",100.0,Bob,8,
