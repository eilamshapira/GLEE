Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $350 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $50, considering I can also buy it from John for $100."", ""product_price"": 50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $50 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It seems you are mistaken about John's offer, as he is only willing to pay $150. I can come down a bit, how about $325?

You have three options:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $325 is still out of my budget. I'm confident that John's offer is $100, not $150.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm afraid there's a misunderstanding about John's offer. He is willing to buy the product for $150. While I appreciate your offer, $75 is too low. Let's try to meet closer to the middle. How about $300? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but $300 is still too high for me.

If we can't agree on a price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100."", ""product_price"": 90}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you are persistent, I'll give you that! However, I really can't go that low. You keep mentioning John's offer of $100, but let me assure you, it is $150. Since you like the product, let's keep trying. How about $275?

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence as well, but I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more significant increase in my offer. I'll give you $100, which is what I know John is willing to sell it to me for. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to take John up on his deal."", ""product_price"": 100}"
