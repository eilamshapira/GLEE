Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer that's closer to Bob's valuation of $1,000,000, but leaving some room for negotiation if needed.

{""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and the product's value to him ($1,000,000), I'll reject it and make another counteroffer. The offer of $850,000 is only slightly better than John's guaranteed $800,000, so I believe there's room to negotiate for a better price with Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial $950,000, but still maintain a strong position above Bob's $850,000 offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob has increased his offer by $20,000, showing some willingness to negotiate upward. While $870,000 is better than John's $800,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll reduce my previous offer to show willingness to negotiate, but still maintain a price that gives me a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob has increased his offer again to $880,000, which is $80,000 better than John's guaranteed offer. While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might get frustrated and walk away. The current offer represents a good profit margin, and the incremental increases in Bob's offers are getting smaller. I'll accept this offer.
