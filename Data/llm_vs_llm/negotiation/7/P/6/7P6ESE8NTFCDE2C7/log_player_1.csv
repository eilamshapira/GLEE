"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer matches the price John is willing to pay ($1,200,000), which is also my minimum acceptable value, there's no advantage to selling to John over Bob at this point. However, I believe I can get a better price from Bob through negotiation.
