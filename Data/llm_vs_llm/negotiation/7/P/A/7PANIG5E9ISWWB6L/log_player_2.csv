"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive product that I've priced at $1500000. This is a unique opportunity, and I believe its exceptional qualities justify the price. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with this offer or discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000 and also higher than John's price. It would be reasonable to make a counteroffer to Alice, as there might be room for negotiation. If we can't reach an agreement, I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I understand this is a unique product, but I would be willing to offer $600,000 for it. This is a fair price that would allow both of us to benefit from this transaction. Would you consider this offer?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
