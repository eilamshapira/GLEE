"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm offering to you first before making it available to other buyers. Based on its features and market value, I'm offering it at $18500. This product has exceptional value and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you. What do you think?",18500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000 for the product given its features and my current financial situation. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $12000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price. I can come down significantly from my initial offer though. Would you consider $16000? This product has exceptional value, and I'm offering you a substantial discount from the original asking price.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $16000 is still a bit high for me. I can stretch my budget to $13500. This is the highest I can go while still considering it a good investment. What do you say?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $13500. We're getting closer, but I'm still not able to go that low considering the product's true value. I can come down to $15000 as my best offer. This represents a significant reduction from my initial price and is a fair value given what you're receiving. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price point.",15000.0,Alice,5,
