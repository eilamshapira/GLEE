Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm offering to you first before making it available to other buyers.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000 for the product given its features and my current financial situation. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $12,000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price. I can come down significantly from my initial offer though. Would you consider $16,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $13,500. We're getting closer, but I'm still not able to go that low considering the product's true value. I can come down to $15,000 as my best offer. This represents a significant reduction from my initial price and is a fair value given what you're receiving. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price point."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
