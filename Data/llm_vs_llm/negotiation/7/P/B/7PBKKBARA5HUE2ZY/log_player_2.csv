Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $12000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $13500. We're getting closer, but I'm still not able to go that low considering the product's true value.

I hope we can reach an agreement at this price point.
