"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, and I understand the value of the product. However, my budget constraints don't allow me to go beyond $900000. I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, but if we can't reach an agreement closer to my target price, I always have the option to sell to John at $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be transparent - I have another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can offer you the product for $1,250,000, which is still a competitive price given its market value."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your transparency. While I understand you have another buyer, I can offer you $1000000. It's the maximum my budget allows, and I hope we can strike a deal that accommodates both of our needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's maximum offer of $1,000,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 (which I can get from John), and given that Bob has indicated this is his maximum budget, it makes the most economic sense to sell to John for $1,200,000 rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to reach my minimum price point."
