"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since my maximum acceptable price is $15,000, I'll start with a significantly lower counteroffer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This leaves room for further negotiation if needed.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
