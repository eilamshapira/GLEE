"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking of a figure closer to $800000. I believe this could be a fair starting point for our discussion. Let's discuss further and find some kind of middle ground. Looking forward to your response.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $800000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1000000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to stay within a range that reflects the product's true value. How about we meet in the middle around $1400000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1400000 is still quite high for me. Let's find a more reasonable middle ground. I'm willing to raise my offer to $1000000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. I am confident that at this price, we can both walk away from this deal satisfied. Please share your thoughts on this new proposal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
