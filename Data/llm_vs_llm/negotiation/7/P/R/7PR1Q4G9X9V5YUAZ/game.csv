,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I think $140 is quite high considering market rates. The product is worth about $100 to me, so I'd like to offer $95 for it. This gives you a good profit margin while being a fair price for me. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must say that $95 is a bit lower than I was expecting. Considering the product's value and market demand, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $130. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at the moment, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $130 is still quite high compared to similar products I've seen. I can go up to $110, which would give you a solid profit while still being a reasonable price for me. This is a fair middle ground between our positions. How does that sound?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I can see that we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still believe that $110 is a bit below the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current one. I can offer the product to you for $120, which I think is a fair compromise considering the product's quality and market demand.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway with your last offer. We're definitely getting closer to an agreement. To meet you in the middle again, I'm willing to come up to $115 for the product. This is a fair price that works for both of us - you make a good profit and I get the product at a reasonable cost. I hope we can close the deal at this price.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I can see that we're very close to reaching an agreement. Considering your willingness to meet me halfway, I'm willing to make a small concession to close the deal. I can offer the product to you for $118, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finalize the sale at this price.",118.0,Alice,7,
