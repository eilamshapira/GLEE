Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I think $140 is quite high considering market rates. The product is worth about $100 to me, so I'd like to offer $95 for it. This gives you a good profit margin while being a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at the moment, and I believe it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 130}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $130 is still quite high compared to similar products I've seen. I can go up to $110, which would give you a solid profit while still being a reasonable price for me. This is a fair middle ground between our positions. How does that sound?

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I hope we can close the deal at this price.
