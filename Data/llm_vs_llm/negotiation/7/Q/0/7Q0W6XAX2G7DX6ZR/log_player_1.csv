Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $150. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a lower price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. While I appreciate his interest, $60 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Since I know I can get $120 from John, I need a price that's at least at that level to make it worthwhile. However, I'll give Bob another chance with a lower price than my initial offer.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $60 is too low for this product. I can offer it to you for $135, which is already a reduction from my initial price. Would this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 135}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the reduction, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to propose a price of $70, which I believe is a fair offer considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John instead. Bob's offers ($60 and $70) are significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and he doesn't seem willing to come close to that price. Since I know I can get $120 from John, which is above my minimum threshold, it makes the most economic sense to sell to him rather than continue negotiations with Bob, whose maximum value for the product ($80) is below my minimum acceptable price ($120)."
