"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","I'll consider Bob's counteroffer of $90. This is higher than my reservation price of $80 and better than selling to John for $80. While I could try to negotiate for more, $90 is already a good offer that exceeds my minimum acceptable price.
