Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. I'm confident in the value of my product, and I want to ensure I maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. It's a significant drop from my initial offer and falls well below my minimum acceptable value.  I'll counteroffer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,500,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. I hope this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly below my desired price. I'm going to continue negotiating with him, hoping to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm dropping my price to $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached the point where Bob's offers are getting close to my minimum, but I'm not convinced he's willing to meet my price. With only four rounds left, I'm taking the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing out completely."
