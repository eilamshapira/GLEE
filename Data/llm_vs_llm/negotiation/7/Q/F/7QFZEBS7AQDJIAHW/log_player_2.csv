"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000 and also higher than John's guaranteed price of $8,000. It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations don't improve, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $6,000. This is below my maximum value of $8,000 and well below John's price, giving me room to negotiate upward if necessary. Since Alice's initial offer was quite high at $12,000, starting lower allows for a potential meeting point that could be beneficial for both parties while still giving me savings compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice only reduced her price by $1,000, from $12,000 to $11,000, which is still significantly above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). There's no reason to accept this offer when I have a guaranteed better option with John. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, trying to move closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7000}

I'll increase my offer to $7,000. This is still below both my maximum value and John's price of $8,000, giving me room to potentially negotiate further if needed. Since Alice has only come down slightly from her initial offer, I'm showing some flexibility by increasing my offer, but I'm still maintaining a position that would give me savings compared to John's price. If Alice doesn't become more reasonable in her pricing, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'm choosing to buy from John for $8,000 because:
1. Alice's price is still significantly above my maximum value of $8,000
2. Alice's price reductions have been minimal (from $12,000 to $11,000 to $10,500), suggesting she's unlikely to drop the price below $8,000 in future rounds
3. John's price of $8,000 is guaranteed and matches my maximum value
4. We've already used half of our negotiation rounds, and Alice hasn't shown willingness to come close to a reasonable price
5. There's no point in continuing negotiations when we have a guaranteed acceptable option available

It's time to take the sure deal with John rather than continue unproductive negotiations with Alice."
