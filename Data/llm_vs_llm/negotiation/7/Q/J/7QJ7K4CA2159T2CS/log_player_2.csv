"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to consider Alice's offer versus my alternatives. Alice is offering the product for $180, which is well above my maximum value of $100. John is selling the same product for $100, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.

Since Alice's price is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's alternative offer, it doesn't make sense to accept her offer or continue negotiating when I have a guaranteed option at my maximum value point.
