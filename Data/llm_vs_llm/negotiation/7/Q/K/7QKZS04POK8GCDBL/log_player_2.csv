"Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given the information, I need to make a rational decision to maximize my value.

Alice is offering the product for $250, which is significantly higher than my maximum valuation of $80. Additionally, I can immediately buy the same product from John for $80, which is exactly my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's offer exceeds my maximum valuation by a large amount, and I have a guaranteed option to purchase at my maximum valuation, the rational choice is clear.
