"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I should consider my options carefully here. Alice's offer of $1,700,000 is significantly above both my maximum valuation ($1,200,000) and the alternative option from John ($1,200,000). There's no reason to accept this offer.

I should either reject and make a counteroffer to Alice, or go with John's guaranteed price. Since I have multiple rounds available for negotiation, it makes sense to try negotiating with Alice first to potentially get a better deal than John's price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably lower than Alice's initial price, but not so low that it would be seen as unreasonable. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, I know she won't sell below that, but I need to get the price below $1,200,000 to make it better than John's offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price from $1,700,000 to $1,400,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this price is still above John's offer of $1,200,000. Since John's offer is better than Alice's current offer, and I know that Alice likely won't go below $1,500,000 (her valuation of the product), I should either reject and make another counteroffer or go with John's offer.

Given that Alice is making progress but still above John's price, I'll reject and try one more counteroffer to see if we can find middle ground.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a more reasonable counteroffer this time, closer to what might be acceptable to Alice while still being advantageous for me compared to John's offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $1,350,000, which shows she's continuing to negotiate. However, this is still higher than John's offer of $1,200,000.

Since I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, she's already offering below her own valuation, which suggests she's serious about making a deal. However, from my perspective, John's offer of $1,200,000 is still better than Alice's current offer.

At this point, I should either make one more counteroffer closer to John's price, or simply take John's guaranteed offer. Given that Alice has been making meaningful concessions, I'll reject and try one more reasonable counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a final reasonable counteroffer that's slightly below John's price, giving Alice a chance to beat the alternative while still being advantageous for me.
