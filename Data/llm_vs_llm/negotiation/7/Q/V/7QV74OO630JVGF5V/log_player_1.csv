Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($10,000) but lower than what I initially offered ($14,000), and considering the product's value to Bob is $15,000, I believe there's room for negotiation to get closer to my initial offer or at least ensure I get a good deal.

Given that I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and the goal is to earn as much money as possible, I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's counteroffer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle or closer to my favor.

My decision for Round 2 is to reject Bob's offer and proceed with a counteroffer.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's new offer of $12,500 is closer to my previous counteroffer of $13,500, indicating that he's willing to negotiate upwards. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, I believe he may be willing to pay even more.

Given that I still have 6 rounds left for negotiation and my goal is to maximize the sale price, I'll reject Bob's current offer and make another counteroffer. This time, I'll reduce the price slightly from my previous offer, aiming to find a mutually acceptable price.

My decision for Round 4 is to reject Bob's offer and proceed with a new counteroffer.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $12,750 is getting closer to my last counteroffer of $13,000. Considering the product's value to Bob is $15,000, he still has room to increase his offer. However, I also need to consider that I've already had several rounds of negotiation, and the difference between my last offer and Bob's current offer is relatively small.

Given that I have 4 rounds left and the gap between our offers is narrowing, I'll make a decision based on the potential for further negotiation versus the certainty of selling at a decent price. Since Bob's offer of $12,750 is still below my last counteroffer but close, I'll consider accepting it as it's a reasonable compromise, especially since selling to John for $10,000 is a less desirable outcome.

My decision for Round 6 is to accept Bob's offer, as it seems like a fair compromise after several rounds of negotiation, and it's better than selling to John.
