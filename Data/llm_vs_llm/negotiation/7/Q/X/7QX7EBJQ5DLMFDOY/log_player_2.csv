"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $120. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Given that I (Bob) value this product no more than $80, Alice's offer of $120 is significantly higher than my maximum valuation. Also, John is already willing to sell me the same product for $80, which matches my maximum valuation.

There's no reason for me to accept Alice's offer at $120 when I can get the exact same product from John at $80. I could try negotiating with Alice, but since I already have a guaranteed option at my maximum value point, the logical choice is to buy from John.
