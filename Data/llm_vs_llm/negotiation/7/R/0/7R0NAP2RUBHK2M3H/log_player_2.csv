"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision that maximizes my value.

Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is exactly the same price that John is offering and exactly the maximum amount the product is worth to me.

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($1,000,000), and this equals my maximum valuation, I am indifferent between accepting Alice's offer or buying from John. However, since rejecting Alice's offer without buying from John wouldn't get me the product at all, I should either accept Alice's offer or buy from John.
