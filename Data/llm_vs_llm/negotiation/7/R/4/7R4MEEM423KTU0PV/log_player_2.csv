"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its value and value it can bring to you, I'm sure you'll find our price of $1400000 quite reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Here's my decision-making process:

*   **Alice's Offer:** $1,400,000
*   **My Max Value:** $1,500,000
*   **John's Price:** $1,500,000

Alice's offer is below my maximum value and also lower than John's price. Therefore, it makes sense to accept the offer.
