"Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. It's something I value highly, but I believe it could be even more valuable in your hands.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a price of $1200000.  What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $850000 and see if we can find some common ground?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $850000 is a significant drop. Let's meet in the middle. How about we settle on $1050000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle. To be totally transparent, my budget has a hard limit, and I'm trying to stay under $900000. Would you consider $875000? I think that's a fair offer, and we can close this deal today.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While $875000 is still below what I hoped for, I'm willing to accept that price IF you can guarantee me [insert a small but valuable concession from Bob - e.g., a positive testimonial, a future referral, etc.]. Would that be agreeable?",875000.0,Alice,5,
