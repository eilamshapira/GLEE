Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $850000 and see if we can find some common ground? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle. To be totally transparent, my budget has a hard limit, and I'm trying to stay under $900000. Would you consider $875000? I think that's a fair offer, and we can close this deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While $875,000 is still below what I hoped for, I'm willing to accept that price IF you can guarantee me [insert a small but valuable concession from Bob - e.g., a positive testimonial, a future referral, etc.]. Would that be agreeable?"",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting close to my fallback option of $800,000. By offering to accept Bob's price with a small concession, I am:

* **Anchoring:** I'm reaffirming that $875,000 is my bottom line.
* **Creating Value:** I'm getting something extra that could benefit me beyond the immediate sale.
* **Potentially Closing:** Bob might find this trade-off appealing and agree to the deal."
