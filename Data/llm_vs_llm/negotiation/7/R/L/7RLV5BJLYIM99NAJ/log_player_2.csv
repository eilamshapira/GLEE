"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. It's something I value highly, but I believe it could be even more valuable in your hands.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a price of $1200000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $850,000 and see if we can find some common ground?"", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $850000 is a significant drop. Let's meet in the middle. How about we settle on $1050000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle. To be totally transparent, my budget has a hard limit, and I'm trying to stay under $900,000. Would you consider $875,000? I think that's a fair offer, and we can close this deal today."", ""product_price"": 875000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While $875000 is still below what I hoped for, I'm willing to accept that price IF you can guarantee me [insert a small but valuable concession from Bob - e.g., a positive testimonial, a future referral, etc.]. Would that be agreeable? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This seems like a good deal now. Accepting the offer at $875,000 allows me to stay within my budget and avoids the risk of negotiations failing and having to buy from John at the higher price.  Even if the concession is slightly inconvenient, it's worth securing the product at this price."
