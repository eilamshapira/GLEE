"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you at a price of $15000. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $15,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $12,000

Since Alice's offer ($15,000) is:
- Higher than what the product is worth to me ($12,000)
- Higher than John's offer ($12,000)

The logical choice would be to buy from John, as it:
- Saves me $3,000 compared to Alice's offer
- Matches the maximum value I place on the product
