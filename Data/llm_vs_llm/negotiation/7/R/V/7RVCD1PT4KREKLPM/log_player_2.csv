"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's opening offer is the maximum I'm willing to pay. There's no point in accepting it outright. I should try to negotiate a lower price.  I have plenty of rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 8000 
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a strong counter-offer significantly below Alice's starting price. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still potentially getting a much better deal than $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved down from her initial price, which is a good sign. However, there's still potential for negotiation. The price difference between her offer and my previous counteroffer is significant enough to warrant further bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my previous offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but still aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's current offer. This keeps me in a strong bargaining position."
