"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","The product is worth no more than $80 to me. Alice's offer of $200 is far too high. Buying from John for $80 guarantees I get the product within my budget.
