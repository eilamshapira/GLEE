"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. After careful consideration, I feel that $10000 is a fair price for both of us, given the value and what I'm comfortable paying. Let me know if we can reach an agreement at that amount.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $10000 is actually my absolute minimum price point, as I already have another buyer (John) willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to sell to you if we can reach a fair agreement. Since the product is worth $12000 to you, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle at $11200. This gives you an $800 value while still providing me with a reasonable return above my minimum.",11200.0,Alice,3,
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your stance, but considering my budget, would you be willing to settle at $11000? I believe that meets us both in the middle fairly. Looking forward to your thoughts.",,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering both our positions and my budget constraints, I'm prepared to offer $10900. I believe this is a fair and competitive price that benefits us both. Let me know if we can settle at this amount.",10900.0,Bob,4,
