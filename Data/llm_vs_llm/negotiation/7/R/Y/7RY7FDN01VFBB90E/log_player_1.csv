Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $10,000 is actually my absolute minimum price point, as I already have another buyer (John) willing to pay that amount.

This gives you an $800 value while still providing me with a reasonable return above my minimum."", ""product_price"": 11200}"
