Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $10000 is actually my absolute minimum price point, as I already have another buyer (John) willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to sell to you if we can reach a fair agreement. Since the product is worth $12000 to you, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle at $11200. This gives you an $800 value while still providing me with a reasonable return above my minimum. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200

I understand your stance, but considering my budget, would you be willing to settle at $11,000? I believe that meets us both in the middle fairly. Looking forward to your thoughts.""}"
