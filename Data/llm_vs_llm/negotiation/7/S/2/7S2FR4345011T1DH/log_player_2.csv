"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer of $12,000 is higher than both my maximum value ($10,000) and John's fixed price ($10,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept her offer. I could try to negotiate with a counteroffer, but since I already know I can get it for $10,000 from John, and Alice's initial offer is significantly above that price, it would be most rational to go with the guaranteed option.
