Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you our exclusive product at a price of $3,000,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I must say that $3000000 is far above my budget and the market value I've researched. I actually have another seller offering the same product for $800000. However, I'm interested in doing business with you if we can reach a reasonable price. I'm willing to offer $600000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
