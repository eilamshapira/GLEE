"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you our exclusive product at a price of $3000000. This product represents unmatched value and quality, and Iâ€™m confident it can deliver significant benefits. Let me know if you're interested in this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. Alice's offer of $3,000,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $800,000 (which matches my maximum value)
4. Alice's initial offer is almost 4 times higher than John's price

Alice's offer is far too high, and while I could try to negotiate, starting from such a high price point ($3,000,000) suggests that reaching a price below $800,000 might be difficult. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower but still leaves room for negotiation, while explaining my position.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I must say that $3,000,000 is far above my budget and the market value I've researched. I actually have another seller offering the same product for $800,000. However, I'm interested in doing business with you if we can reach a reasonable price. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
