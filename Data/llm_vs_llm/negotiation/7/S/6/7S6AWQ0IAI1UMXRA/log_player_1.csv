Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Considering its value to you, I'm prepared to offer it to you at a price of $1,150,000. This is a fantastic deal for you, and I believe it reflects the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1150000 is a bit above my target price.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Considering Bob's counteroffer and my minimum price, I have to weigh my options carefully. While $1,050,000 is more than my minimum, I want to try and get a higher price. However, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.

I'll **RejectOffer** and try to negotiate further.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,050,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the product is worth a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1100000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet at $1075000?  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.
