"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a number closer to $850000. I believe this price point reflects the product's value more accurately and fits better within my budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850000 is lower than what I can accept. Given the value this product brings to you and its worth to me, how about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $1000000.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I see your point, but I need to manage my budget effectively. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000. This price acknowledges the product's value while allowing me to stay within my financial constraints. Let's make a deal happen at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to come down slightly more to $950000. This is my final offer. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
