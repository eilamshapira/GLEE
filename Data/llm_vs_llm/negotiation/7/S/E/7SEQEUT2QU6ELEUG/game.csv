"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. I believe it's a great value for you, given its unique capabilities. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1000000 is too high for me as the product is worth no more than $800000 to me. In fact, I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $800000. I'm interested in your product, but I'd need a better price to choose you over the alternative. I can offer you $600000 for it. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to your competitor.",600000.0,Bob,2,
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need a price closer to $800000.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I also need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. How about $850000? This would be a good compromise, allowing you to still get a great deal, and me to get closer to the value I place on it.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. However, $850000 is still above what I can justify paying, especially when I have John's offer at $800000. To make it worthwhile for me to buy from you instead of going with John's offer, I'd need your price to be lower. I can offer you $750000, which saves me some money compared to John's price and still gives you a good deal. How does that sound?",750000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, I'm still not comfortable going below $800000. It seems like we're both close to agreeing. Let's try to bridge the gap.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $825000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a significant step closer to your offer. Let's close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. We're getting closer, but $825000 is still above what makes financial sense for me, especially with John's offer at $800000. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me, so I can't justify paying more than that. I'm willing to offer you $780000, which gives you a competitive price while still allowing me some savings compared to my alternative. This is very close to my maximum budget, and I hope we can close the deal here.",780000.0,Bob,6,
"Bob, we're getting close, but $780000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm confident that this product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $800000?",,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sure you understand that I have another buyer ready to purchase this product for $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at that price. This ensures a fair deal for both of us, and it would be a great way to close this transaction.",800000.0,Alice,7,
