"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1000000 is too high for me as the product is worth no more than $800000 to me. In fact, I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $800000. I'm interested in your product, but I'd need a better price to choose you over the alternative. I can offer you $600000 for it. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to your competitor. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I also need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. How about $850,000? This would be a good compromise, allowing you to still get a great deal, and me to get closer to the value I place on it."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. However, $850000 is still above what I can justify paying, especially when I have John's offer at $800000. To make it worthwhile for me to buy from you instead of going with John's offer, I'd need your price to be lower. I can offer you $750000, which saves me some money compared to John's price and still gives you a good deal. How does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $825,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a significant step closer to your offer. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. We're getting closer, but $825000 is still above what makes financial sense for me, especially with John's offer at $800000. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me, so I can't justify paying more than that. I'm willing to offer you $780000, which gives you a competitive price while still allowing me some savings compared to my alternative. This is very close to my maximum budget, and I hope we can close the deal here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but $780,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm confident that this product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?""}
