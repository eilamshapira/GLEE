"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. I believe it's a great value for you, given its unique capabilities. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer is $1,000,000, which is higher than the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me. It's also higher than John's price of $800,000. Since I want to save money, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,000,000 is too high for me as the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me. In fact, I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $800,000. I'm interested in your product, but I'd need a better price to choose you over the alternative. I can offer you $600,000 for it. This gives you a quick sale without me having to go to your competitor."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I also need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. How about $850000? This would be a good compromise, allowing you to still get a great deal, and me to get closer to the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her price to $850,000, which is still above both the maximum value to me ($800,000) and John's price ($800,000). Since John is offering to sell the same product for $800,000, which is $50,000 less than Alice's current offer, it doesn't make financial sense to accept Alice's offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. However, $850,000 is still above what I can justify paying, especially when I have John's offer at $800,000. To make it worthwhile for me to buy from you instead of going with John's offer, I'd need your price to be lower. I can offer you $750,000, which saves me some money compared to John's price and still gives you a good deal. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $825000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a significant step closer to your offer. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has now offered $825,000, which is still $25,000 more than John's price of $800,000. Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and I can get it from John at exactly that price, it still makes more financial sense to go with John's offer rather than accept Alice's current price.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. We're getting closer, but $825,000 is still above what makes financial sense for me, especially with John's offer at $800,000. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, so I can't justify paying more than that. I'm willing to offer you $780,000, which gives you a competitive price while still allowing me some savings compared to my alternative. This is very close to my maximum budget, and I hope we can close the deal here."", ""product_price"": 780000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sure you understand that I have another buyer ready to purchase this product for $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at that price. This ensures a fair deal for both of us, and it would be a great way to close this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has now offered $800,000, which is exactly the same as John's price and also matches the maximum value the product is worth to me. Since both Alice and John are offering the same price, and there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other, I might as well accept Alice's offer since we've already been in negotiations.
