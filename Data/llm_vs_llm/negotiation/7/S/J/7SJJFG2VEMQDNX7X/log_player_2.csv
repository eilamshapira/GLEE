Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now closer to my desired price range, and it's still significantly cheaper than buying from John. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a favorable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers, leaving me with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price."
