Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get more than my minimum acceptable price of $80.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob offered $130, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80 and a reasonable decrease from my initial offer, I'll accept this offer.
