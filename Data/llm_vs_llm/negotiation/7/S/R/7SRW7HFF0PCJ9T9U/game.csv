Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it for $10000. What do you think?,10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $6000 for the product. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer! However, I can't go as low as $6000. How about we settle on $9000? I'd love to make this deal work for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $9000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $7000 is closer, I can’t accept that just yet. How about we meet at $8500? I believe it’s a fair compromise.",8500.0,Alice,5,
