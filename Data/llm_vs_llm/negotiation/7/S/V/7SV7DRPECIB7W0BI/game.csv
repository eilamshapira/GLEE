"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product here that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $300. It's a great value at that price!",300.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $300 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $300 might be a bit much. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $250.",250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, so how about $110? I think that's a fair price for the product.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $110 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Let's try $225.",225.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I see we're getting closer, but $225 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and your new price. How about $167.50? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",167.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. It seems we're having some trouble finding common ground. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to ensure I'm getting a worthwhile return. How about $200?",200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $200 is still above my budget. I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm willing to make one more serious offer. How about $120? It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the alternatives.",120.0,Bob,8,
