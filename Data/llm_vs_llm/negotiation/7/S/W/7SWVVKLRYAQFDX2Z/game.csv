"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I can definitely do better than $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a decent profit. Let's try to find a middle ground.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm trying to be flexible, but I still need to get a fair price for the product. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to come down a bit more. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",100.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're making progress. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate that. However, I still need to get a price that works for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I hope you can see that I'm already being quite flexible. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is getting quite drawn out. I can offer you $80, which is my final offer. I understand this is a lower price, but I need to stick to my budget. ",80.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid I still can't go that low. I've been trying to be flexible and work with you, but I have another buyer who is willing to pay a higher price. I'm willing to give you one last chance to buy the product, but I need to get at least $90 for it. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider selling to the other buyer.",90.0,Alice,9,
