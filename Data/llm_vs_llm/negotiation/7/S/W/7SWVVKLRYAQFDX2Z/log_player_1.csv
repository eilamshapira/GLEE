Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target price. $60 is too low, and I have a better alternative with John, so I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I can definitely do better than $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a decent profit. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a little too high for my budget. How about we try to split the difference a bit more?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

$70 is still too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price. Since Bob is willing to negotiate and split the difference, I'll try to make another counteroffer that's more reasonable. I'll aim for a price that's closer to my target, but still shows that I'm willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm trying to be flexible, but I still need to get a fair price for the product. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to come down a bit more. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see that we're getting closer. I'm willing to budge a little more, but I need you to meet me halfway.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

$75 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get a better deal. Since Bob is willing to continue negotiating, I'll try to make another counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous one, but still higher than Bob's offer. I want to create a sense of momentum and encourage Bob to meet me at a higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm glad we're making progress. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate that. However, I still need to get a price that works for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I hope you can see that I'm already being quite flexible. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting quite drawn out. I can offer you $80, which is my final offer. I understand this is a lower price, but I need to stick to my budget.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

$80 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I have a better alternative with John. Since Bob has stated that $80 is his final offer, I don't see any potential for further negotiation that would meet my target price. With only two rounds left, I think it's time to consider selling to John, but I'll make one last attempt to negotiate with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid I still can't go that low. I've been trying to be flexible and work with you, but I have another buyer who is willing to pay a higher price. I'm willing to give you one last chance to buy the product, but I need to get at least $90 for it. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider selling to the other buyer."", ""product_price"": 90}"
