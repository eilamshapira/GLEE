Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid I still can't go that low. I've been trying to be flexible and work with you, but I have another buyer who is willing to pay a higher price. I'm willing to give you one last chance to buy the product, but I need to get at least $90 for it. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider selling to the other buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $90. It's better to secure the product at my maximum budget with John rather than risk Alice selling to the other buyer."
