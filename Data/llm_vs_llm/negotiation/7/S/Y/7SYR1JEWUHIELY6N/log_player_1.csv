Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to sell this product for at least $150 to make it worthwhile, as that's my minimum value. However, I know the product is only worth $100 to Bob, so he likely won't pay more than that. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I should either try to get Bob to pay at least $150 or sell to John.

Let me make an initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my initial offer of $150 and countered with $80, I need to decide what's best. Given that:
1) The product is worth at least $150 to me
2) I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150
3) The product is only worth $100 to Bob

There's no reason for me to sell below $150, especially when I have a guaranteed buyer at that price. I'll make one more attempt with Bob before considering selling to John.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
