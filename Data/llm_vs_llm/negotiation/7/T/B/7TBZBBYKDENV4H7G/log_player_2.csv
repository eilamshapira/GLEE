Alice's offer is much higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $100}

I'm starting with a low offer to see how much negotiating room there is. This leaves room to go up if needed, while still being a significant saving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice came down a bit, the price is still too high.  I'm willing to negotiate further since there's still room between her offer and John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

This offer splits the difference between her last offer ($180) and my previous offer ($100). It shows I'm willing to compromise but still want a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down in smaller increments now, but $170 is still too high.  I'm getting close to John's price, so I'll make one more counter offer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

This is my final offer. It's a fair compromise and a reasonable price for the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is unlikely to come down much further, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation for a potential saving of $10. It's time to buy from John at the guaranteed price of $150."
