"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is close to my maximum budget of $1,000,000, but I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, I'll choose to reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. This gives me a chance to potentially negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable, considering the product's value to Alice is $800,000. My goal is to save as much money as possible while still being realistic about the negotiation.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, considering the product's value to her is $800,000. Since she rejected my previous counteroffer of $750,000, I'll try to meet her halfway and make another counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one but still lower than her new offer.

However, for the sake of the negotiation process, I'll first respond to the current offer. Given that I have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, I'll reject Alice's current offer to see if I can get an even better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice rejected my offer of $750,000 and then lowered her price to $925,000, I'll try to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me. I'll increase my offer, but not by too much, to see if Alice is willing to compromise further.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $900,000 is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but I still think there's room for negotiation since the product is worth $800,000 to her. Given that I've already offered $825,000 and she's come down to $900,000, I'm inclined to try and meet in the middle of these two figures to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To try and meet in the middle, I'll calculate the midpoint between my previous offer of $825,000 and Alice's current offer of $900,000. The midpoint would be ($825,000 + $900,000) / 2 = $862,500. I'll make a counteroffer slightly below this midpoint to try and negotiate a better price.

{""product_price"": 860000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $885,000 is getting very close to the midpoint I was aiming for, and it's significantly lower than her initial offer. Considering the product's value to her is $800,000, she's already making a considerable concession. Given that I've been trying to save as much money as possible, I need to weigh the potential benefits of further negotiation against the risk of losing this deal.

At this point, Alice's offer is close enough to my target that I'm willing to accept it, especially since going to John would cost me $1,000,000, which is $115,000 more than Alice's current offer.
