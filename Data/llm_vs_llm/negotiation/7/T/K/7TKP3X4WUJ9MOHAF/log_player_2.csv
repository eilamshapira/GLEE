"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer is $14,999
2. Jhon's fixed price is $15,000
3. My maximum willingness to pay is $15,000
4. The difference between Alice and Jhon's price is only $1

Even though Alice's offer is just barely below my maximum willingness to pay, it's still $1 cheaper than buying from Jhon. While the savings are minimal, there's no strategic advantage in rejecting Alice's offer since Jhon's price is higher.
