"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is way too high - it's more than 4 times the maximum value of $12,000 that the product is worth to me. I should make a counteroffer in the next round that's below my maximum value of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that the product is worth $12,000 to me (and I can buy it from John at that price), I'll start with a low but reasonable offer to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 8000}

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $50,000, but it's still a reasonable starting point. It gives room for negotiation while being well below my maximum value of $12,000. If Alice rejects this, we can work towards finding a middle ground, while I always have the option to go to John if needed."
