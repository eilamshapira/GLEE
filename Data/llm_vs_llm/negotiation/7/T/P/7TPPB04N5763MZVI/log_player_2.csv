"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Based on the information provided, Alice's offer is to sell the product for $12,000, which is exactly the same price that John is offering and also the maximum amount the product is worth to me.

Since there's no price advantage between Alice's offer and John's price, and the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, there's an opportunity to make a counteroffer to Alice to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I have the opportunity to negotiate with Alice, I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than her initial price, but still reasonable enough that she might consider it.

{""product_price"": $8,500}"
