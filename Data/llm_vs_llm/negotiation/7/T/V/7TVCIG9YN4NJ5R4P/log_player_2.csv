"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has tremendous value, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $1,000,000 to me (maximum value)
2. Alice is offering it for $2,000,000
3. John is offering it for $1,000,000

Alice's offer ($2,000,000) is:
- Double my maximum valuation
- Double John's price
- Would result in a significant loss for me

Since John's offer matches the product's worth to me and is significantly lower than Alice's offer, the logical choice is to buy from John.
