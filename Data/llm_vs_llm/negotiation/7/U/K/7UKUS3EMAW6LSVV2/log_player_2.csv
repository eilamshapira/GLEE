"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","The price Alice is offering is $12,000, which is more than the product is worth to me (maximum $10,000) and also more than John's alternative offer of $10,000.

Since Alice's price exceeds both my maximum valuation and the readily available alternative, the logical choice is to either reject and make a counteroffer, or simply buy from John.

Given that John offers the product at exactly my maximum valuation ($10,000), and there's uncertainty about whether Alice would accept a lower counteroffer, the most prudent decision is to buy from John.
