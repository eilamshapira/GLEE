"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the product is only worth $100 to me, Alice's offer of $150 is too high. I can get the same product from John for $100, which matches my maximum valuation. There's no reason to accept Alice's higher price or even make a counteroffer since I have a guaranteed option at my maximum value.
