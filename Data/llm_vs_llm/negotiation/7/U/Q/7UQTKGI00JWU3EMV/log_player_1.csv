Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my pricing strategy. Since the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, I should set a price that gives me a chance to earn more while ensuring I don't lose the opportunity to sell.

I'll set a price significantly above my minimum acceptable value to give myself room for potential higher profit, while still keeping it within a potentially reasonable range for Bob.
