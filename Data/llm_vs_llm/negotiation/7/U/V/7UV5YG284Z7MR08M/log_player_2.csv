"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

It's better to negotiate with Alice for a lower price. We are aiming for under $15,000, and her starting offer leaves room for bargaining."

This is a starting point. It's a significant jump down from Alice's offer, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards towards a price that works for both of us."

We're getting closer. Let's try to push Alice a little further down."

This offer puts us in a good position. It's a reasonable increase from our last offer and still well below Alice's initial offer.  Let's see how she responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

This price is a good compromise. It's below our maximum budget and likely close to the best price we can get from Alice."
