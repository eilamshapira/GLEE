"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $6000 for the product given its features and my current financial situation. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. $6000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $14000.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $14000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $7000, which is the maximum I can afford while still valuing the product's features. Let me know if this works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to work with me. However, I have a minimum price I can accept. How about we try $13000? That's as low as I can realistically go while still making it worthwhile for me.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still out of my budget. I can increase my offer to $7500, which is really stretching my limits. Is there any way we can meet at this price?",7500.0,Bob,6,
