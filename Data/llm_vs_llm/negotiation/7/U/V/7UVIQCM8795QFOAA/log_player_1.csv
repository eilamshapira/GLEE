"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, Bob, let's get down to business. I'm willing to part with this incredible product, something truly unique and valuable. Considering its rarity and importance, I'm offering it to you for:

```json
{
  ""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire this product. Based on its intrinsic value, I'm offering it to you for..."",
  ""product_price"": 2500000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, the price is significantly higher than what I am willing to pay. I am looking to spend no more than $1000000. Considering this, I would like to offer you $500000 for the product. This is a starting point, and I hope we can negotiate further from here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a tricky situation. Bob's offer is far lower than my minimum, but rejecting it allows us to keep negotiating. However, the potential upside is limited, and I could lose out entirely.

Considering the low offer and the possibility of John's offer, I choose to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

}
```"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price. While $500,000 is not going to work for me, I'm willing to be flexible. Given the product's exceptional qualities, I'm now willing to offer it to you for:

```json
{
  ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure this deal makes sense for both of us. I am now offering the product to you for..."",
  ""product_price"": 2200000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but the current price is still quite high. I am willing to raise my offer to $600000. This is moving closer to my maximum budget, and I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","$600,000 is still too low. However, it's better than before. I need to try one more time, and maybe I can get a better offer. I still have room to go down.

{
  ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is getting frustrating. $700,000 is still way too low. I'm losing patience, and I'm running out of time and offers. However, I will give Bob one more try.

{
  ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.
