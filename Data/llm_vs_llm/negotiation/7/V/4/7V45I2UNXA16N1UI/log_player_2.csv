"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an exceptional product that I believe could be a great fit for you. I'm offering it at a price of $1500000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The price offered by Alice ($1,500,000) is significantly higher than both:
1. My maximum value for the product ($800,000)
2. John's alternative offer ($800,000)

It makes the most financial sense to buy from John and save $700,000 compared to Alice's offer."
