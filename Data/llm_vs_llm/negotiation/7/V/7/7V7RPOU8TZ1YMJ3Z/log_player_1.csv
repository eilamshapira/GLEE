Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to decide on a price to offer Bob. Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, he won't accept any price above that. However, the product is worth at least $150 to me, and I have John willing to buy it for $150. Given that my alternative is to sell to John for $150, there's no incentive for me to sell to Bob for less than $150.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
