"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2300000. I believe this is reflective of the significant return on investment you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2300000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me is $1000000, I'm willing to offer $1100000.  This price is fair, allowing you a good profit while still within my price range.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. This product has the potential to generate substantial returns, far exceeding the difference in our valuations. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1700000? This allows me a reasonable profit while still offering you a good deal.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1700000 is still outside of my price range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1100000.  This price allows for a good profit margin for you while remaining within my budget.  I'm confident this is a fair offer and hope we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly further, but $1100000 is simply too low. Let's settle on $1550000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept while still making a reasonable profit. What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
