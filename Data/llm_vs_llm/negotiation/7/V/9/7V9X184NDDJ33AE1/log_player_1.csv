Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2300000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me is $1000000, I'm willing to offer $1100000.  This price is fair, allowing you a good profit while still within my price range.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

This price allows for a good profit margin for you while remaining within my budget.  I'm confident this is a fair offer and hope we can reach an agreement.
