This price is fair, allowing you a good profit while still within my price range.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. This product has the potential to generate substantial returns, far exceeding the difference in our valuations. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1700000? This allows me a reasonable profit while still offering you a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

$1,700,000 is still too high.  Let's see if we can get closer to my budget."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly further, but $1100000 is simply too low. Let's settle on $1550000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept while still making a reasonable profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

While $1,550,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high.  I'm going to buy the product from John instead.  It's worth it to save the extra $550,000."
