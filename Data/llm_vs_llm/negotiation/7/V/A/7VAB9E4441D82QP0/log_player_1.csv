"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 (which I can get from John), and significantly below my initial asking price, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.
