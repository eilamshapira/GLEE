Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my offer to maximize my earnings. 

Bob values the product at $1,000,000, while I can sell it to John for $800,000 if Bob rejects my offer.

If I price too high, Bob might reject my offer, and I'd be left with my minimum of $800,000 from John. If I price too low, I'd leave money on the table.

Since Bob's maximum value is $1,000,000, I should offer him a price that gives him some incentive to accept while maximizing my return. A reasonable approach would be to offer slightly below his maximum value.
