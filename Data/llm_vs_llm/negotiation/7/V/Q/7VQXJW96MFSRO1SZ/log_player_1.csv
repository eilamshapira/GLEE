Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000}

Rationale: Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay this amount, there's no reason for me to offer Bob a lower price. If Bob accepts, I get $1,200,000, and if he rejects, I still get $1,200,000 from John. Offering a lower price would only reduce my profit without any benefit."
