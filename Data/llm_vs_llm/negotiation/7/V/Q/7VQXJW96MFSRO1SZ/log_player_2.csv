"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, so I wouldn't want to pay more than that. Alice's offer is for $1,200,000, which exceeds both the product's value to me and John's alternative offer of $1,000,000.

Since John is offering the product at exactly what it's worth to me ($1,000,000), and this is $200,000 less than Alice's offer, I should buy from John.
