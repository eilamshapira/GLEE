"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $1600000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something of great value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she is asking for $1,600,000 for the product. This is significantly higher than the $1,200,000 the product is worth to me. It's also higher than John's offer of $1,200,000.

Since Alice's initial offer exceeds both my valuation and John's alternative price, there's no reason to accept it or even enter further negotiations.
