"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The logical choice is to buy from John because:
1. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me
2. Alice's offer ($2,000,000) is twice my maximum valuation
3. John's price ($1,000,000) matches my maximum valuation
4. Buying from John will save me $1,000,000 compared to Alice's offer"
