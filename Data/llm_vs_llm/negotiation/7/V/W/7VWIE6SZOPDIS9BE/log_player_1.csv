"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $40. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $40
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","I'll reject Bob's offer as it's well below the minimum value of $100 that the product is worth to me. In fact, I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $100, so accepting anything less wouldn't make financial sense.
