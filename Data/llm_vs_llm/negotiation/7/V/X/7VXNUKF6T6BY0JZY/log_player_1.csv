Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $60 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80, I will reject his offer. I will also not sell the product to John yet, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob. So, I will proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob.
