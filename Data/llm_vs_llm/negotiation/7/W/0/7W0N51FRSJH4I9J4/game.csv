"Alice, thanks for your offer. Based on what I understand of the productâ€™s intrinsic value and my current evaluations, I'm prepared to offer $1000000. I believe this reflects a fair price for both of us, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is below what I can accept for this product. I know the value this product brings to its owner, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that same amount. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price to $1100000, which would still provide you with significant value given the product's worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
