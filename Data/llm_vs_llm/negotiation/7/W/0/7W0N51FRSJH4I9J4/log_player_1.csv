Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your offer. Based on what I understand of the productâ€™s intrinsic value and my current evaluations, I'm prepared to offer $1000000. I believe this reflects a fair price for both of us, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a new counteroffer to Bob. His offer of $1,000,000 is exactly the same as John's offer, and I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so there should be room for negotiation to reach a better price that benefits both parties."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is below what I can accept for this product. I know the value this product brings to its owner, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that same amount. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price to $1,100,000, which would still provide you with significant value given the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
