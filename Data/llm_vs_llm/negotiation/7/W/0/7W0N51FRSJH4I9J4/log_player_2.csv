Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is below what I can accept for this product. I know the value this product brings to its owner, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that same amount. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price to $1100000, which would still provide you with significant value given the product's worth.
