"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to increase your offer. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. Considering your latest offer of $1200000, I'd like to propose a compromise. I'm willing to lower my previous price of $1400000 to $1300000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair midpoint between our negotiations so far.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
