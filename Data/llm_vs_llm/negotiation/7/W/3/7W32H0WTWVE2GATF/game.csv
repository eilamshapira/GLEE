"Thank you for the new offer, Alice, but $220 is still too high for me. I can offer you $90 for the product. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your continued interest, Bob, but $90 is still too low considering the product's value. Let me meet you part way - I can offer it for $190. This is a significant discount from my previous offers.",190.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $190 is still more than I can spend. I would like to offer you $95 for the product. Please consider this.",95.0,Bob,6,
