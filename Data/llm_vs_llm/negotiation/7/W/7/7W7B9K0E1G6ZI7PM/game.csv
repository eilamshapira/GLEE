,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $700000, considering the market value and my budget. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to negotiate further.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700000 is below my minimum threshold.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $850000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to get a good return on my investment.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $700000 was too low, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $775000. This price takes into account the product's value and my budget, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and close the deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $775000 is still too low for me.  Let's meet halfway again. I'm willing to lower my price to $825000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this offer.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your patience and for continuing to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to lower the price to $825000. However, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $795000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. If not, I may need to consider other options, including purchasing from another seller.",795000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $795000 is closer, I'm only willing to come down to $810000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've invested in this negotiation.  I believe this is a win-win scenario for both of us.  If you're not able to accept this final offer, I'll need to consider other options for selling the product.",810000.0,Alice,7,
