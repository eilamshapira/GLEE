"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm initially offering it to you for $200. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product looks great, $200 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $50. Would that work for you?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, $50 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product. I understand you have a budget, but I'm willing to come down to $175.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $175 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  I could go up to $60.  That's a serious offer, and I think it's a good compromise.",60.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $60 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $115.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it's a price I can realistically accept.  Let's make this deal happen!",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and your current one? I'd be willing to pay $87.50.",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. How about we meet in the middle again, at $100? I'm confident that this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run, and it's a price that allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to make this work, but I need to stick to my budget.  I can offer $75.  This is my final offer.",75.0,Bob,8,
