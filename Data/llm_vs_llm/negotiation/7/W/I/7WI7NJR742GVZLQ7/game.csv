"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $12000, I'm afraid I can't go that low. The product has significant value, and my absolute minimum would be $17500. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer, reflecting my genuine interest in doing business with you.",17500.0,Alice,3,
