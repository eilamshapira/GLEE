"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's initial offer of $120 is already below my maximum budget of $150, I'll consider it a relatively good starting point. However, I'd like to try to negotiate a better price to save as much money as possible.

My decision for Round 1 is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Alice a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","For my counteroffer, I'll start by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. This will give us room to negotiate and potentially find a mutually acceptable price.

My counteroffer is:

{""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $110 is $10 lower than her initial offer, which shows that she's willing to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming to get the best possible deal.

Since $110 is still above my ideal price, I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 2, I offered $90, and Alice rejected it. Now, she's come back with a price of $110. To try to meet in the middle, I'll increase my offer from $90 to $100. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and move closer to her price.

My counteroffer is:

{""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice's new offer of $105 is getting closer to my target price. She's only $5 away from my previous counteroffer of $100.

At this point, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a mutually acceptable price. However, I'll try to squeeze out a bit more savings.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer, but this time, I'll move closer to her price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $105, and my previous offer was $100, I'll try to split the difference. I'll increase my offer to $102.50, which is roughly the midpoint between our last two offers.

My counteroffer is:

{""product_price"": 102.50}"
