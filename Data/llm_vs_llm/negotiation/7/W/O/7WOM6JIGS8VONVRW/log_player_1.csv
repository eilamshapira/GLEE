Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to choose a price that maximizes my earnings while considering Bob's willingness to pay.

Bob values the product at $120, which means he won't pay more than that. If he rejects my offer, I can sell to John for a guaranteed $120.

Since I'm guaranteed $120 from John if Bob rejects my offer, there's no reason for me to offer Bob a price below $120. If I offer exactly $120, Bob should be indifferent between accepting and rejecting (since the product is worth exactly $120 to him).
