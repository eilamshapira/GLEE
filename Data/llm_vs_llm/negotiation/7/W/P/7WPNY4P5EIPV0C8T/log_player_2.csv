"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $20000. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $20,000, I need to evaluate if this makes sense for me.

The product is only worth $8,000 to me at most, so paying $20,000 would mean I'm losing $12,000 in value. Alice is offering a price that's significantly above both my maximum value and what John is offering.

Since John is willing to sell me the same product for $8,000 (which is exactly my maximum value), and Alice's initial offer is much higher than this, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
