"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
2. John's price is $15,000 (the maximum I'm willing to pay)
3. Alice's offer is $11,000, which is $4,000 less than John's price
4. Even if negotiations with Alice fail, I can always fall back on John's offer

Alice's offer of $11,000 is significantly lower than both my maximum value ($15,000) and John's price ($15,000). While I could try to negotiate for an even lower price by making a counteroffer, $11,000 is already a good deal with substantial savings. There's also a risk that if I reject this offer, Alice might increase her price in subsequent negotiations.
