"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! However, $2000000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1200000. Would you consider $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1600000? This is a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my interest in doing business with you.",1600000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. Given your budget concerns and my need to maintain the product's value, I'm proposing a new price of $1500000. This offer shows my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's worth. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
