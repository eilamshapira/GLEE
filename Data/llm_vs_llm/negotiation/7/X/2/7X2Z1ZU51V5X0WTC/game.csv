"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe could be of great value to you. Given its exceptional quality and the potential benefits it brings, I'm offering it to you for $2000000. I believe this reflects the true value and benefits you will receive.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I find $2000000 to be significantly above market value. I've done my research, and I know I can get a similar product elsewhere for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $1200000? This would be a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in doing business with me. I understand your position, but considering the unique features and the added long-term value my product offers, I'm willing to lower the price to $1750000. I believe this would still ensure you get the quality and benefits you deserve while making it worthwhile for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, and I understand the value you're offering. However, $1750000 is still above what I can justify for this purchase. I can get the same product for $1500000 elsewhere, but I'd rather work with you. I can offer $1350000, which would give you a quick sale and save me from having to look elsewhere. How does that sound?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and as a gesture of goodwill, I'm willing to further reduce the price to $1600000. This offer reflects a balance between the exceptional benefits you will receive and a fair return on my end. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
