Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I find $2000000 to be significantly above market value. I've done my research, and I know I can get a similar product elsewhere for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider $1200000? This would be a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob's offer:

I can get the same product for $1500000 elsewhere, but I'd rather work with you. I can offer $1350000, which would give you a quick sale and save me from having to look elsewhere.
