(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer is the same price as John's ($15,000), and I know the product is only worth $10,000 to Alice, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There's room for negotiation to get a better price.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer but not too low to keep the negotiation reasonable. Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, I'll offer a price that gives her some profit but is significantly better for me than $15,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice moved down from $15,000 to $14,000, showing some flexibility. I'll increase my previous offer to show I'm also willing to move toward a middle ground, but still try to get a good deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down another $500, now offering $13,500.

I'll continue negotiating.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has shown steady movement downward from $15,000 to $14,000 to $13,500. To keep the negotiation moving and show good faith, I'll increase my offer again, but still aim for a price that gives both parties a fair deal.
