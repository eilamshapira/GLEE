"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that I know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob and I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,000,000 from John, I'll start with a high offer to test Bob's willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong position.

{""product_price"": 1,200,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Given that Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and even below his own valuation ($800,000), and considering I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's initial offer was quite low at $600,000, I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still maintain a strong position, knowing I have John's $1,000,000 offer as backup.

{""product_price"": 1,050,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $650,000 is still significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and his own valuation ($800,000). Since I have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,000,000, and Bob doesn't seem to be making substantial increases in his offers, it's best to end the negotiation and take John's offer.
