(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is way above my budget and what I value the product at. It's not a good starting point. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 600000}

This is a starting offer. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation and is within a reasonable range of my budget.  Let's see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice came down a little, but it's still too high. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 650000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to move, but I'm still aiming for a price well below her current offer. Let's see if she's willing to meet me closer to the middle."
