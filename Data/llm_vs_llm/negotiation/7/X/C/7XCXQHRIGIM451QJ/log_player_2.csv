"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $2,000,000 against my maximum value of $800,000 and John's offer of $800,000.

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation and John's alternative price. Since I'm looking for a product worth no more than $800,000 to me, paying $2,000,000 would be a very poor decision.

Given that I can buy the exact same product from John for $800,000, which is already at my maximum acceptable price, there's no reason to accept Alice's much higher offer or even continue negotiating unless I believe I can get Alice to drop her price substantially below $800,000.
