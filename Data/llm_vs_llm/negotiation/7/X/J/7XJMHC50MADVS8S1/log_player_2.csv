"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $80 to me and Alice's initial offer was quite high at $120, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 70}

This counteroffer is below my maximum value of $80 and gives room for negotiation, while also being not too low to be considered unreasonable given that the product is worth $100 to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $120 to $110, showing some flexibility, I'll increase my previous offer but still stay below my maximum value of $80.

{""product_price"": 75}

This offer shows I'm willing to negotiate up from my initial $70 offer, but still maintains a good position for me as it's below both my maximum ($80) and John's alternative price ($80)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The negotiation with Alice isn't moving towards a price below $80 (my maximum value), and she's still offering well above that at $105. Since John offers the product at exactly $80, which is my maximum value, it's best to take his offer rather than continue negotiating with Alice who seems unlikely to drop below $80."
