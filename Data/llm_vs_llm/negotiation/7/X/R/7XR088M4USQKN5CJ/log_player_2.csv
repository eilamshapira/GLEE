Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $15,000 is her starting price and way above my budget."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This is a starting point. It's a significant jump down, but it leaves room for negotiation and keeps us well below my maximum budget. Let's see how Alice responds."
