"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $600000 is too low for the value this product provides. I can offer it to you for $1000000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects the true value of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving up in price, Bob, but $700000 is still below the market value. I can come down to $900000, which is a fair price considering the product's quality and value.",900000.0,Alice,5,
