"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,200,000. This is a competitive price for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was looking for a price that fits within my budget. I'm willing to offer $600000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. $600,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, as it's even lower than John's guaranteed offer. I'll continue negotiating with Bob to try to reach a better price.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $600,000 is too low for the value this product provides. I can offer it to you for $1,000,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $600,000 is too low for the value this product provides.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1000000 is still above my budget. I can increase my offer to $700000 to meet halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer is still below John's guaranteed price of $800,000, and we still have several rounds left for negotiation, I'll make another counteroffer to try to reach a better price.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you moving up in price, Bob, but $700,000 is still below the market value. I can come down to $900,000, which is a fair price considering the product's quality and value."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
