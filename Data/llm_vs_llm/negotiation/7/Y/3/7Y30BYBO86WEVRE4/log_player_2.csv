"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll analyze this situation.

Alice's offer is $900,000 for a product worth $800,000 to her. The product is worth up to $1,000,000 to me, and I have John's standing offer at exactly $1,000,000.

Alice's current offer of $900,000 would save me $100,000 compared to John's price. However, I can likely negotiate for a better price since there are still 10 rounds remaining.

Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, she has room to reduce her price and still make a profit. I should reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice that's lower than her initial price but still above her valuation of $800,000.

{""product_price"": $840,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I see that Alice has reduced her price from $900,000 to $880,000, which is progress. She rejected my offer of $840,000, but has met me partway.

Given that:
- The product is worth up to $1,000,000 to me
- Alice's cost is $800,000
- We still have several rounds of negotiation available
- Alice has shown willingness to reduce her price

I think there's still room to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll continue the negotiation by increasing my previous offer slightly, but still trying to get a good deal.

{""product_price"": $850,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I notice Alice has reduced her price again from $880,000 to $870,000. We're making progress in the negotiation, as she's moved down by $10,000 from her last offer. She rejected my counteroffer of $850,000, but continues to decrease her price.

Given that:
- We're now $130,000 below John's price of $1,000,000
- Alice's cost is $800,000, so she still has room to negotiate
- We still have several rounds left
- Alice is showing a pattern of reducing her price by $10,000 each round

I think there's still opportunity to negotiate a better price, so I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly to continue moving toward a middle ground.

{""product_price"": $855,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $865,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $865,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I see that Alice has reduced her price again from $870,000 to $865,000. We continue making progress, though at a slower rate now - $5,000 reduction instead of $10,000. She rejected my counteroffer of $855,000, but is still willing to decrease her price.

Analysis:
- We're now at $865,000, which is $135,000 below John's price of $1,000,000
- Alice's cost is $800,000, so she's making a $65,000 profit at this price
- We have 3 more rounds of negotiation after this one
- The price gap between us has narrowed to $10,000 ($865,000 vs. $855,000)
- Alice is showing smaller price reductions, suggesting we're approaching her limit

While I could continue negotiating, the potential additional savings might be limited to perhaps another $5,000-$10,000, and there's a risk of not reaching agreement if I push too hard. The current offer of $865,000 represents good value compared to John's price.
