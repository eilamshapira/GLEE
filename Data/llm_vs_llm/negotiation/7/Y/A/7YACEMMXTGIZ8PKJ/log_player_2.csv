"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $150 is significantly higher than my maximum valuation of $100 and higher than John's price of $100. It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Since we have 10 rounds of negotiation available, there's room to negotiate for a better price with Alice before potentially falling back to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}

I'll make a counteroffer of $80. This is below both Alice's cost ($100) and John's price ($100), giving room for negotiation upward. Since Alice's initial offer was quite high at $150, starting low at $80 allows for potential compromise in future rounds while still potentially landing at a price below $100, which would be beneficial for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has lowered her price from $150 to $130, showing willingness to negotiate, but this is still significantly above both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100). It makes sense to reject this offer and continue negotiating. Since Alice has shown flexibility by reducing her price by $20, we can continue the negotiation process to try to reach a more favorable price. If we can't reach an agreement, we still have John's offer of $100 as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 90}

I'll increase my offer to $90. This is a reasonable increase from my previous offer of $80, showing I'm willing to negotiate. It's still below Alice's cost of $100, but getting closer to a potentially acceptable middle ground. If Alice rejects this, I still have several rounds to negotiate and can always fall back to John's offer of $100 if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has reduced her price again (from $130 to $120), but it's still above both my maximum value and John's price of $100. Since Alice has shown a pattern of gradually reducing her price (150 -> 130 -> 120), it's worth continuing the negotiation. However, if we can't reach a price at or below $100 in the next few rounds, I'll need to consider taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 95}

I'll increase my offer to $95. This is a significant move up from my previous offer of $90, showing I'm seriously trying to reach a deal. It's close to Alice's cost of $100 while still giving me a small advantage compared to John's price. This offer demonstrates good faith in negotiating while still keeping the price below my maximum value."
