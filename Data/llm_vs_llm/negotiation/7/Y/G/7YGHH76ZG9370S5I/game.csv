"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. The product sounds interesting, but the price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $400000 for it.",400000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that the initial price might be a bit high, but I believe the product's value lies somewhere in between our proposals. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Here's a revised offer.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the new offer, but it's still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $600000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $600000 is still below my expectations. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer, but not as low as $600000. Considering my previous offer was $1800000, meeting halfway would put us at $1200000, which is the minimum I'm comfortable with. I'm open to further discussion, but I hope you can understand my position.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
