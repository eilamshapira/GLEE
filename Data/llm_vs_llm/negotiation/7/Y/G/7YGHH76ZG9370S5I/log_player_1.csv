"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. The product sounds interesting, but the price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $400000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will reject Bob's offer of $400,000 because it's significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $1,200,000. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll proceed to the next round to send a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that the initial price might be a bit high, but I believe the product's value lies somewhere in between our proposals. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Here's a revised offer."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the new offer, but it's still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $600000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will reject Bob's offer of $600,000 because it's still significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $1,200,000. Although Bob has increased his offer, it's still far from what I consider a fair price. I'll proceed to the next round to send a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a price that is more acceptable to both of us. 

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $600,000 is still below my expectations. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. Here's a revised price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $600,000 is still below my expectations. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer, but not as low as $600,000. Considering my previous offer was $1,800,000, meeting halfway would put us at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm comfortable with. I'm open to further discussion, but I hope you can understand my position."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
