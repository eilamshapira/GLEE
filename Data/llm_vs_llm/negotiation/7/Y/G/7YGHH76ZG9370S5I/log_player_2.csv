Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $600000 is still below my expectations.

Considering my previous offer was $1800000, meeting halfway would put us at $1200000, which is the minimum I'm comfortable with. I'm open to further discussion, but I hope you can understand my position.
