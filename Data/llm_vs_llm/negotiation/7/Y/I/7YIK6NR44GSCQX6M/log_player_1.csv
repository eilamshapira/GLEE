Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might find valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $110. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still exceeding our minimum selling price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, we have a guaranteed sale to John for $120. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while minimizing the risk of losing the sale entirely."
