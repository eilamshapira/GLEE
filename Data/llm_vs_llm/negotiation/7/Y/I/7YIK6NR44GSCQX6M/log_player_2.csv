"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might find valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $110. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum price and what John offers.  You're better off seeing if Alice will come down or going with John."
