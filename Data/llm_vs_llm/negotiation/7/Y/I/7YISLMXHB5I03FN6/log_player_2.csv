"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer compared to my alternatives.

Alice is offering the product for $18,000, which exceeds the maximum value of $15,000 that the product is worth to me. I also have the option to buy from John for exactly $15,000.

Given these circumstances, I should not accept Alice's current offer as it would mean paying more than the product is worth to me. I could try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, but since I already have a guaranteed option to buy from John at the maximum value I place on the product, there's no reason to continue negotiation.
