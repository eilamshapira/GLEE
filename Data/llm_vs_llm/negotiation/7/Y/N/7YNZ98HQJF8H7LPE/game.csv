"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that the initial price may have been out of your budget, but I still believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I can offer a slight discount, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's meet in the middle.",4000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $4000000 is still significantly above what I can justify spending. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget constraints. Please let me know if this works for you.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and the fact that you're willing to work with me to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to ensure that I'm getting a fair value for the product. Considering your budget constraints and my own requirements, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer the product to you for $1200000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still reflects the product's true worth.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
