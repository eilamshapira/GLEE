"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has tremendous value, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 5000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, the initial price is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $800,000 is below my target price, and I believe the product is worth more. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is an option, but I'd like to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that the initial price may have been out of your budget, but I still believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I can offer a slight discount, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 4000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $4000000 is still significantly above what I can justify spending. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget constraints. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. While Bob's increased offer of $900,000 is moving in the right direction, it's still below the $1,000,000 that John is willing to pay, and I believe the product is worth more. I'll try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and the fact that you're willing to work with me to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to ensure that I'm getting a fair value for the product. Considering your budget constraints and my own requirements, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer the product to you for $1,200,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still reflects the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
