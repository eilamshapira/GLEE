"Hi Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $15000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-value item at a competitive rate. Let me know if you're interested!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $6000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway though. How about we settle at $12000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",12000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15000 was too high for you. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower the price to $13500. This is a significant discount and reflects my desire to work with you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $10000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10000 is still below our minimum threshold. I can come down to $12500, which is very close to your last offer and still within a reasonable range for us. Let me know if this works for you.",12500.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I need to maintain a certain value for the product. How about we settle at $12250? This is a final stretch from my side, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the product's worth.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12250 is still above my budget. Considering the product's value to me and the fact that I can get it from John for $8000, I'm willing to make a serious offer of $9500. This is my highest offer, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.",9500.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9500 is still below what we can accept. I'm willing to go down to $12000, which is the lowest I can offer. This is a fair price and matches what another buyer is willing to pay. Let me know if you can meet at this price.",12000.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're close but not quite there yet. I'm firm on $12000 as it's the lowest I can go and still meet our needs. This is the same price another buyer is willing to pay, so it's a fair and final offer from my side. Can you meet at this price?",12000.0,Alice,7,
