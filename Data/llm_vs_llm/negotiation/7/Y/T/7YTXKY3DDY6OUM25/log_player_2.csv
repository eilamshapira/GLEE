"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $900,000
2. John's price: $1,200,000
3. My maximum value for the product: $1,200,000

Alice's offer is $300,000 less than both John's price and my maximum value. This is a good deal that would save me money compared to buying from John, and it's well within my maximum value.
