"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $1.5 million is at the very top of the market price. Given that I have other options available at this price point, I'd like to propose $1100000. This is a substantial offer that reflects my serious interest in doing business with you while giving both of us room to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your enthusiasm for this product. However, $1100000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this opportunity.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price still provides a good margin for both of us and allows us to work together. Let's meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
