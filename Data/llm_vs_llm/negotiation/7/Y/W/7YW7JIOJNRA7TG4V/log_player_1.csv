Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $1.5 million is at the very top of the market price. Given that I have other options available at this price point, I'd like to propose $1100000. This is a substantial offer that reflects my serious interest in doing business with you while giving both of us room to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still provides a good margin for both of us and allows us to work together. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
