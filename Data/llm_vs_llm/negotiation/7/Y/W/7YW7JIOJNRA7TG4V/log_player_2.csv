"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, valued at over a million dollars to me.  I believe it has tremendous potential for you, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable.  My initial price is $1500000.  Let's discuss this further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Given that:
1. Alice's offer is $1,500,000
2. John's price is also $1,500,000
3. The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me

Since both Alice's offer and John's price are the same, and this is exactly at my maximum value, I should try to negotiate for a better price with Alice. There's potential to save money by making a counteroffer, while I still have John's offer as a backup.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower to leave room for negotiation but not so low as to be insulting.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $1.5 million is at the very top of the market price. Given that I have other options available at this price point, I'd like to propose $1,100,000. This is a substantial offer that reflects my serious interest in doing business with you while giving both of us room to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your enthusiasm for this product. However, $1100000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this opportunity.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price still provides a good margin for both of us and allows us to work together. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has made a significant reduction from her initial offer of $1,500,000 to $1,250,000, which represents a $250,000 savings compared to both her initial offer and John's price. This is a substantial improvement that would save me 16.7% off the maximum price I was willing to pay. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might become less flexible or withdraw from negotiations. Given the significant savings already offered, it would be prudent to accept this offer.
