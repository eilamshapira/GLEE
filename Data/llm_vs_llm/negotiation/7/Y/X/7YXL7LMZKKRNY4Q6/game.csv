Hello Bob! I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. I believe it's worth $120. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?,120.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I'm on a budget and I was thinking more along the lines of $60 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I can't go as low as $60 as that's below my cost. I have another buyer, John, who's willing to pay $80, but I'd prefer to sell it to you. Could you meet me in the middle at $100? This product is high quality and worth the investment.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for the new proposal. I appreciate your willingness to sell to me instead of John. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to meet you halfway between your new offer and my previous one. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $80?",80.0,Bob,4,
