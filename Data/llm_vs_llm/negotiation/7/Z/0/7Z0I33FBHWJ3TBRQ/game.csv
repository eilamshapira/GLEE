"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a premium product that has significant value. Based on its quality and market potential, I'm offering it at $2500000. This product has proven to be extremely valuable and has substantial growth potential. What do you think?",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I think $2500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, considering the product's quality and market potential. I'd like to propose a price of $900000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand budget considerations are important, but I must point out that your offer of $900000 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product's actual value to me is no less than $1000000, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Given the product's quality and potential, I can reduce my asking price to $1800000, which is still well below market value for something of this caliber. Would this work better for your budget?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for sharing more information about the product's value. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $1800000 is still above my budget. Considering the product's quality and potential, as well as the presence of another buyer, I'd like to propose a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your revised price. I'd like to offer $1350000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
