Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I think $2500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, considering the product's quality and market potential. I'd like to propose a price of $900000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand budget considerations are important, but I must point out that your offer of $900,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product's actual value to me is no less than $1,000,000, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Given the product's quality and potential, I can reduce my asking price to $1,800,000, which is still well below market value for something of this caliber. Would this work better for your budget?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for sharing more information about the product's value. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $1800000 is still above my budget. Considering the product's quality and potential, as well as the presence of another buyer, I'd like to propose a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your revised price. I'd like to offer $1350000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
