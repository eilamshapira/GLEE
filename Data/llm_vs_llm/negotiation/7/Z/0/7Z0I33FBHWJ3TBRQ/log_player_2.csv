Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I think $2,500,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, considering the product's quality and market potential. I'd like to propose a price of $900,000."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand budget considerations are important, but I must point out that your offer of $900000 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product's actual value to me is no less than $1000000, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Given the product's quality and potential, I can reduce my asking price to $1800000, which is still well below market value for something of this caliber. Would this work better for your budget? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for sharing more information about the product's value. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $1,800,000 is still above my budget. Considering the product's quality and potential, as well as the presence of another buyer, I'd like to propose a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your revised price. I'd like to offer $1,350,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
