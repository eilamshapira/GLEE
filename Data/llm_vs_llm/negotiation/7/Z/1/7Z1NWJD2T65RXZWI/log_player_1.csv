"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $115 is a bit high for me. Given that similar products are available in the market, I'd like to offer $105 for it. This would still give you a good profit margin while being a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

# You then send the following message to Bob:
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $105 is a bit low for me. Given the quality and uniqueness of my product, I think $110 is a fair price.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I've considered your offer and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $110? This way, we both get a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
