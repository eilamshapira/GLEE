"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $115. It's a great value and I think you'll be very happy with it. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:
1. The product is worth up to $120 for me
2. Alice's current offer is $115
3. John is willing to sell for $120
4. The product is worth $100 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation

Since Alice's offer ($115) is less than John's price ($120), and there's still room for negotiation (since Alice's cost is $100), I should try to negotiate for a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's above Alice's cost but gives me a better deal:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $115 is a bit high for me. Given that similar products are available in the market, I'd like to offer $105 for it. This would still give you a good profit margin while being a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I've considered your offer and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $110? This way, we both get a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the new situation:
1. Alice has reduced her price from $115 to $110
2. This is a $10 reduction from her initial offer
3. The price is now $10 better than John's price ($120)
4. Alice has met me halfway between her initial $115 and my $105 offer

This is actually a good offer because:
- It's significantly below John's price
- Alice has shown willingness to negotiate and made a reasonable compromise
- While we might negotiate further, the potential savings might not be worth the risk of losing the deal
