"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $850000. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I need to get closer to the product's true value. Given that this product is worth $1000000 to you, I'm willing to come down to $925000, which still provides you with $75000 in value while giving me a fair return. This represents a $25000 reduction from my initial offer. Would this work for you?",925000.0,Alice,3,
