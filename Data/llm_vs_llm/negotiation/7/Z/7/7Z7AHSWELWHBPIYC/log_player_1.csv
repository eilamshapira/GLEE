"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I do see the value in the product, $1500000 is above my budget. I am prepared to offer $800000 for it. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $800,000 is lower than my initial offer and I believe the product is worth more. My counteroffer will be $1,200,000. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,500,000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.""}"
