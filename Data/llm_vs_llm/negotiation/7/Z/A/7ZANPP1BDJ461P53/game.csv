"Hello Bob, I have a product I would like to sell to you. It's a high-quality item that provides excellent value. I'm offering it to you for $18000. Let me know if you're interested in purchasing it at this price.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $6000 is significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $12000, which is my absolute minimum. However, I'd prefer to work with you. I can lower my price to $16000, which is still a fair price considering the product's quality and value. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for being willing to work with me. I understand that $6000 was too low, but I'm still not comfortable with $16000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I hope this is something you'd be willing to consider.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but I must be transparent - I already have a guaranteed buyer at $12000. Your offer of $7000 is still significantly below that. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I also need to consider my bottom line. Given that I can sell it elsewhere for $12000, I'm willing to offer you the product at $14500, which represents a substantial discount from my initial price. This is a fair compromise that still gives you good value while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Can we agree on this price?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and offer a discount. However, $14500 is still out of my budget. I understand that you have a guaranteed buyer at $12000, and I'm willing to meet you closer to that price. I'll offer $7500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. If we can't reach a mutually beneficial price, I'll have to consider buying from John, who is willing to sell it to me for $8000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I need a better price.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I notice you mentioned John is willing to sell to you for $8000. However, I'm curious about this as John is actually interested in buying from me at $12000, not selling to you. That aside, I understand budget constraints, but I simply cannot go below my guaranteed sale price of $12000. Since you mentioned you're willing to meet closer to that price, I'll offer $13000, which is only $1000 above my minimum and significantly below my initial asking price. This is really the best I can do while still making this deal worthwhile for me. Can we agree on this?",13000.0,Alice,7,
