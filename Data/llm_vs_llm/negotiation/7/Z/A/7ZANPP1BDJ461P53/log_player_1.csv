Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $12,000, which is my absolute minimum. However, I'd prefer to work with you. I can lower my price to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's quality and value. Would you be willing to consider this offer?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for being willing to work with me. I understand that $6000 was too low, but I'm still not comfortable with $16000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I hope this is something you'd be willing to consider.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but I must be transparent - I already have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000. Your offer of $7,000 is still significantly below that. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I also need to consider my bottom line. Given that I can sell it elsewhere for $12,000, I'm willing to offer you the product at $14,500, which represents a substantial discount from my initial price. This is a fair compromise that still gives you good value while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Can we agree on this price?"", ""product_price"": 14500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and offer a discount. However, $14500 is still out of my budget. I understand that you have a guaranteed buyer at $12000, and I'm willing to meet you closer to that price. I'll offer $7500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. If we can't reach a mutually beneficial price, I'll have to consider buying from John, who is willing to sell it to me for $8000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I need a better price.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I notice you mentioned John is willing to sell to you for $8,000. However, I'm curious about this as John is actually interested in buying from me at $12,000, not selling to you. That aside, I understand budget constraints, but I simply cannot go below my guaranteed sale price of $12,000. Since you mentioned you're willing to meet closer to that price, I'll offer $13,000, which is only $1,000 above my minimum and significantly below my initial asking price. This is really the best I can do while still making this deal worthwhile for me. Can we agree on this?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
