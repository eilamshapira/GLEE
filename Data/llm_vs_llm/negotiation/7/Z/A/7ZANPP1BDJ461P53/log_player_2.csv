"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product I would like to sell to you. It's a high-quality item that provides excellent value. I'm offering it to you for $18000. Let me know if you're interested in purchasing it at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $18,000, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower, but still shows that I'm interested in the product. I'll offer $6,000, which is below my maximum budget of $8,000.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $6000 is significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $12000, which is my absolute minimum. However, I'd prefer to work with you. I can lower my price to $16000, which is still a fair price considering the product's quality and value. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice's new offer of $16,000 is still above my budget, but I'm willing to negotiate further. Since she mentioned that $12,000 is her absolute minimum for another buyer, I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer and her new offer. I'll offer $7,000, which is closer to my maximum budget of $8,000.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for being willing to work with me. I understand that $6,000 was too low, but I'm still not comfortable with $16,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I hope this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but I must be transparent - I already have a guaranteed buyer at $12000. Your offer of $7000 is still significantly below that. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I also need to consider my bottom line. Given that I can sell it elsewhere for $12000, I'm willing to offer you the product at $14500, which represents a substantial discount from my initial price. This is a fair compromise that still gives you good value while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Can we agree on this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice's new offer of $14,500 is still above my budget, and she's mentioned that she has a guaranteed buyer at $12,000. I'll try to use this information to my advantage. I'll offer $7,500, which is a slight increase from my previous offer, and also mention that I'm willing to walk away and buy from John if we can't reach a mutually beneficial price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and offer a discount. However, $14,500 is still out of my budget. I understand that you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, and I'm willing to meet you closer to that price. I'll offer $7,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. If we can't reach a mutually beneficial price, I'll have to consider buying from John, who is willing to sell it to me for $8,000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I need a better price."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I notice you mentioned John is willing to sell to you for $8000. However, I'm curious about this as John is actually interested in buying from me at $12000, not selling to you. That aside, I understand budget constraints, but I simply cannot go below my guaranteed sale price of $12000. Since you mentioned you're willing to meet closer to that price, I'll offer $13000, which is only $1000 above my minimum and significantly below my initial asking price. This is really the best I can do while still making this deal worthwhile for me. Can we agree on this? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
