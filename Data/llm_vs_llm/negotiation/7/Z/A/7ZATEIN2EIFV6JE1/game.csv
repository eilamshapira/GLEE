"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, the price is a bit too high for me at the moment. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I cannot accept $9000 as that's below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value, and I need to ensure I receive fair compensation. I can come down to $16000, which is already a substantial reduction from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of what you'll be receiving.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate the reduction, it's still outside my budget. Considering the market value and my personal valuation, I can increase my offer to $9500.",9500.0,Bob,4,
