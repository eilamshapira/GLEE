"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I’m excited to offer you a unique product that I believe could greatly benefit you. I’m offering it for $1500000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's offering the product for $1,500,000, which is $500,000 more than what John is willing to sell it for ($1,000,000). Additionally, the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me.

Given these facts, it wouldn't make financial sense to accept Alice's offer when I can get the same product from John for less. I don't need to negotiate further with Alice since I already have a better alternative.
