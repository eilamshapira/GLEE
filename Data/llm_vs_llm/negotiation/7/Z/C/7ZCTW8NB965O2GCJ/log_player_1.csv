"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $180 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer is equal to the minimum amount I'm willing to accept, but I believe the product is worth more, I'll try to negotiate further to see if Bob is willing to pay a higher price. 

My counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $160. It's a great product, and I believe it's worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 160}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand that you think the product is worth $160, but I'm still a bit short of that. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $140 is higher than John's offer, but still lower than what I believe the product is worth, I'll try to negotiate further to see if Bob is willing to pay an even higher price.
