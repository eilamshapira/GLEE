Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","The offer of $8,500 is only slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. Given that we're only in round 2 and Bob has already shown willingness to negotiate by making a reasonable counteroffer, I believe there's potential to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","This is a good offer from Bob - $9,500 is a significant improvement from his previous offer of $8,500 and represents a good profit margin above my minimum price of $8,000. While there might be room to negotiate further, there's also a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away if we continue negotiating. I'll take this favorable offer.
