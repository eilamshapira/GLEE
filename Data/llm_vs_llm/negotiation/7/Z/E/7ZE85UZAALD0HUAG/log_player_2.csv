"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given the options, I'll analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $12,000
2. John is also selling it for $12,000
3. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me

Since Alice's offer is the same as John's price, and the same as my maximum value for the product, there's no advantage in accepting Alice's offer right now. It makes sense to try negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a better price before potentially falling back on John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice is asking for $12,000 and John is offering the same price, I'll try to negotiate for a lower price with Alice. I'll start with a reasonably low offer to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": $8,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price to $10,500, which is $1,500 less than both her initial offer and John's price. This is a significant improvement and represents good savings. However, since there are still more rounds available for negotiation, I'll try to get an even better price by making another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has come down from $12,000 to $10,500, which is good progress. I'll continue negotiating by meeting her somewhere in the middle between my previous offer ($8,500) and her current offer ($10,500).
