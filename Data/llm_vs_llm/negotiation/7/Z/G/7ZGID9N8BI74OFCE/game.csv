"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $200 is significantly above my budget. I can purchase this same product from another seller for $100, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you be willing to sell it for $70? This would save me some money and allow us to close the deal quickly.",70.0,Bob,2,
