"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $200 is significantly above my budget. I can purchase this same product from another seller for $100, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you be willing to sell it for $70? This would save me some money and allow us to close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
