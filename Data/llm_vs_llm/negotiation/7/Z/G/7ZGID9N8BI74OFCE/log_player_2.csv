"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $200. Let me know if you'd like to proceed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to carefully consider my options here. Alice is offering the product for $200, which is more than the $100 maximum I'm willing to pay. I also know I can buy the same product from John for $100 guaranteed. There's no reason to accept Alice's current offer, and I should try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $200 is significantly above my budget. I can purchase this same product from another seller for $100, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you be willing to sell it for $70? This would save me some money and allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 70}"
