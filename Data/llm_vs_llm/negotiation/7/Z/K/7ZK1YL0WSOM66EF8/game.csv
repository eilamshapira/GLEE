"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $150 is a bit steep for my budget. I've seen similar products for less elsewhere. Would you consider selling it for $100? This would be a fair price that works better for me.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product has more value than $100. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. How about we settle at $125? This price reflects the product's quality and uniqueness, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price and working with me. Your willingness to negotiate shows good faith. Could we meet in the middle at $110? This would be a price point that works well for my budget while still recognizing the product's value.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I still feel that $110 is a bit low for the product's value. Considering you've come up from $100, I'm willing to come down a bit more from my previous offer. How about we meet at $120? This price is more in line with what I'm looking for, and I think it's a fair compromise.",120.0,Alice,5,
