"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $150 is a bit steep for my budget. I've seen similar products for less elsewhere. Would you consider selling it for $100? This would be a fair price that works better for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since I know the product is worth no less than $100 to me, and Bob's offer is exactly $100, I could consider accepting it. However, I also have the option to sell it to John for the same price, which would end the negotiation immediately. Given that I have 8 more rounds to potentially get a better offer from Bob, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product has more value than $100. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. How about we settle at $125? This price reflects the product's quality and uniqueness, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price and working with me. Your willingness to negotiate shows good faith. Could we meet in the middle at $110? This would be a price point that works well for my budget while still recognizing the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer of $110 is getting closer to what I'm looking for, but it's still a bit lower than I'd like. Since I've already invested time in the negotiation and Bob seems willing to continue discussing the price, I'll reject his offer again and try to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I still feel that $110 is a bit low for the product's value. Considering you've come up from $100, I'm willing to come down a bit more from my previous offer. How about we meet at $120? This price is more in line with what I'm looking for, and I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 120}"
