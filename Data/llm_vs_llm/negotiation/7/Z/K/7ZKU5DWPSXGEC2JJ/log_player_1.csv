Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. Since I know I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John if Bob rejects my offer, I can be somewhat aggressive in my pricing to Bob. I want to maximize my potential profit, but not price it so high that Bob will definitely reject it. Since Bob's valuation is unknown, I'll aim high while keeping it in a potentially reasonable range.
