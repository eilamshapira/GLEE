"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest, but I can't go as low as $70. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? I can offer you the product for $90.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you, Alice, for considering my previous offer and for your counteroffer of $90. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $75? I believe this price is more reasonable, considering your initial valuation and the fact that I'm genuinely interested in purchasing the product from you.",75.0,Bob,4,
