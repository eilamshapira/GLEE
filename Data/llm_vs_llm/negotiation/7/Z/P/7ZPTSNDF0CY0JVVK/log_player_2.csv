"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I am offering the product to you for $100. Let me know if you are interested in purchasing it at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's initial offer of $100 is at the upper limit of what I'm willing to pay, and I can get the same product from John for the same price, I don't see a need to accept this offer immediately without trying to negotiate a better price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in hopes of getting a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, hoping to negotiate a better price. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible and the product is worth $80 to Alice, I'll make an initial counteroffer of $70, which is below my maximum budget of $100 but still potentially attractive to Alice given her valuation of the product.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest, but I can't go as low as $70. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? I can offer you the product for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has made a counteroffer of $90, which is still somewhat high but closer to what I'm willing to pay. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I don't want to accept $90 without trying to negotiate further, especially since Alice has already come down from $100 to $90, indicating some flexibility in her pricing.

Given that Alice's valuation of the product is $80, and she's currently offering it to me for $90, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject the $90 offer and make another counteroffer, trying to split the difference between my previous offer of $70 and Alice's current offer of $90, or even aiming a bit lower to test Alice's willingness to sell at a price closer to her valuation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll send a new counteroffer: 

{""message"": ""Thank you, Alice, for considering my previous offer and for your counteroffer of $90. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $75? I believe this price is more reasonable, considering your initial valuation and the fact that I'm genuinely interested in purchasing the product from you."", ""product_price"": 75}"
