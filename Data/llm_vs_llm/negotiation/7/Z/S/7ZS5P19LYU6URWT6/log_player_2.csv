"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this unique product. Considering its quality and exclusivity, I'm offering it to you for $25000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she's offering the product for $25,000. Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and John is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $8,000, Alice's offer is far too high.

The logical choice is to buy from John, as this will save me $17,000 compared to Alice's offer.
