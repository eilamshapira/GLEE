"Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's offer ($17,500) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000), it wouldn't be financially wise to accept her offer. John's offer provides the same product at a much better price that matches my maximum value.
