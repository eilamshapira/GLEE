"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2300000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential value.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $2300000 is much higher than I expected. I am looking to spend no more than $1200000. Could you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $1200000 is too low for this product's value. While I understand you have a budget, I have to maintain a certain price point given the product's quality and market value. I can reduce my initial asking price significantly to $1900000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This price reflects both the true value of the product and my willingness to work with you to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1900000 is still quite high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800000 to show good faith in our negotiation. This price considers my budget and the potential value the product can bring to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,
