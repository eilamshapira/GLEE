"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,300,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential value."", ""product_price"": 2300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $2300000 is much higher than I expected. I am looking to spend no more than $1200000. Could you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but there's still room for negotiation since we're only in round 2."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $1,200,000 is too low for this product's value. While I understand you have a budget, I have to maintain a certain price point given the product's quality and market value. I can reduce my initial asking price significantly to $1,900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This price reflects both the true value of the product and my willingness to work with you to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1900000 is still quite high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800000 to show good faith in our negotiation. This price considers my budget and the potential value the product can bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm choosing to sell to John because Bob's latest offer of $800,000 is even lower than his previous offer of $1,200,000, suggesting he's not negotiating in good faith. With John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 and Bob moving in the wrong direction with his offers, it makes more sense to take the sure deal with John rather than continue negotiations that appear to be deteriorating."
