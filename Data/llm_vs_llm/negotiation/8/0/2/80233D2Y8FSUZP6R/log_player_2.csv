"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $150 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $80, and also higher than John's price. It would be better to make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice, knowing that I always have the option to buy from John at $80 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 50}

I'll start with a lower offer of $50. This gives room for negotiation while still being a reasonable price. If Alice counters with a price that's still above $80, I can always go to John's offer as a backup."
