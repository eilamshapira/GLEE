Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, I will reject his offer. I will also not sell the product to John yet, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob. So, I will proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer.

My counteroffer is: $18,000

However, according to the format, I should respond with one of the given options. Since I'm rejecting Bob's offer and proceeding to the next round, the correct response is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 18000}"
