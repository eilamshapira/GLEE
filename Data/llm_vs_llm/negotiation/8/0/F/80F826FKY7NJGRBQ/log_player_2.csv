"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to consider the options carefully. 

Alice is offering the product for $20,000, which is more than the maximum value of $10,000 that the product is worth to me. This means I would be losing money if I accepted this offer.

John is offering the same product for $10,000, which is exactly the maximum value to me. While this doesn't save me any money, it ensures I don't pay more than the product is worth.

Given these options, the most sensible choice is to either buy from John immediately or reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price than $10,000.

Since Alice's initial offer is so high ($20,000), it suggests she may have room to negotiate down significantly. However, there's no guarantee she'll accept a reasonable counteroffer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $18,000 is still well above the $10,000 maximum value the product is worth to me. While she has reduced her price by $2,000, it's still not competitive with John's offer of $10,000.

Since Alice's counteroffer is still significantly higher than both my previous offer and John's standing offer, I should either try one more counteroffer or simply buy from John.

Given that Alice only came down slightly from her initial high price, it seems unlikely she'll eventually reach a price below John's $10,000 offer. At this point, John's offer looks much more reasonable.
