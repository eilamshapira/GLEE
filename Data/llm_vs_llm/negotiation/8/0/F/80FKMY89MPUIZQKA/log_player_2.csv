(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer of $180 is above my budget of $150, I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $120. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150. It's still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's new offer of $150 is exactly at my maximum budget, and I also have the option to buy the product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in continuing to negotiate with Alice. I might as well buy the product from John, as it guarantees the price and ends the negotiation process.
