"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","The offer from Alice is $2,500,000, which is significantly higher than the maximum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me. Furthermore, I have the option to buy the same product from John for $1,000,000, which is already at my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's price is 2.5 times higher than John's price, and John's price is already at my maximum valuation, the economically rational decision is to buy from John.
