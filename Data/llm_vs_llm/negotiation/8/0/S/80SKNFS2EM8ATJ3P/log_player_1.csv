Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that the product is worth $100 to me and only $80 to Bob, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $100, it wouldn't make sense to sell to Bob for less than $100. However, I'll start the negotiation with Bob at a higher price to leave room for potential negotiation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($100) and even below his own valuation ($80), and I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $100, the rational choice is clear.
