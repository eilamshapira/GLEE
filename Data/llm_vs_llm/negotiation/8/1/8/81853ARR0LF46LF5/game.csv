"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I can actually get it from another seller, John, for $120. Since that's the maximum I'm willing to pay, I'd prefer to pay less if buying from you. Would you consider $90 for the product? This would give me a reason to choose your offer over the alternative.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you have an alternative option, but I believe my product is worth more than $90. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a better price. How about we meet in the middle between my initial offer and your counteroffer? I can offer you the product for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,
