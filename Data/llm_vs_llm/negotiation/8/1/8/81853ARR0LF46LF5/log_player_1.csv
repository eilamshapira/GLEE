"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I can actually get it from another seller, John, for $120. Since that's the maximum I'm willing to pay, I'd prefer to pay less if buying from you. Would you consider $90 for the product? This would give me a reason to choose your offer over the alternative. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you have an alternative option, but I believe my product is worth more than $90. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a better price. How about we meet in the middle between my initial offer and your counteroffer? I can offer you the product for $105."", ""product_price"": 105}"
