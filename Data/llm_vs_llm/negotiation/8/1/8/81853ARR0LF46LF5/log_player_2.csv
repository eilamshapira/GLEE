"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think of my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'll analyze the situation:

Alice is offering the product for $120, which is the maximum value the product is worth to me. At the same price, I could also buy it from John.

Since Alice mentioned she's open to negotiation, and this is just her initial offer, it makes sense to try to negotiate a better price by making a counteroffer. This gives me a chance to save some money, compared to immediately accepting or buying from John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, I can actually get it from another seller, John, for $120. Since that's the maximum I'm willing to pay, I'd prefer to pay less if buying from you. Would you consider $90 for the product? This would give me a reason to choose your offer over the alternative."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you have an alternative option, but I believe my product is worth more than $90. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a better price. How about we meet in the middle between my initial offer and your counteroffer? I can offer you the product for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $105 is better than her initial $120 price and also better than John's fixed price of $120. Since she's showing willingness to negotiate and has already reduced her price by $15, I should accept this offer as it saves me $15 compared to buying from John.
