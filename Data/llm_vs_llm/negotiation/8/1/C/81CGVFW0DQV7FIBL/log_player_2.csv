"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a competitive price. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $120 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $149
3. John is offering the product for $120
4. The difference is $29

Alice's offer ($149) is significantly higher than what the product is worth to me ($120) and higher than John's offer ($120). It would not be economically rational to accept Alice's offer when I can get the same product from John at a lower price that matches my maximum valuation.
