"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000), I will reject her offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a relatively low offer.

{""product_price"": $1,000,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,350,000 is still higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000). However, it's a slight improvement from her initial offer of $1,500,000.

I'll reject her offer again and try to negotiate further. Since Alice has already come down by $150,000, I'm hoping she'll be willing to come down even more.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","In Round 2, I offered $1,000,000, and Alice rejected it. Now, she's offering $1,350,000. To try to meet in the middle, I'll increase my offer, but not by too much. I'll aim for a price that's still below $1,200,000, but closer to Alice's offer.
