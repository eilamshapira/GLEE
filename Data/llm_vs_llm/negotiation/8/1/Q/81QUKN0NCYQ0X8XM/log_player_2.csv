"Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alright, let me analyze this situation:

- I (Bob) value the product at no more than $1,000,000
- Alice is offering to sell it for $999,999
- John is offering to sell it for $1,000,000
- My goal is to save as much money as possible while acquiring the product

Alice's offer is $1 cheaper than John's offer. While the difference is minimal, it still saves me money compared to buying from John.
