"Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice's offer is $130
3. John's fixed price is $150
4. Alice's cost is $120, so she has room to negotiate lower

Given that:
- $130 is better than John's price ($150)
- There's still room for negotiation since Alice's cost is $120
- I could potentially save more money by making a counteroffer

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price. Alice might be willing to go lower since her cost is $120.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's cost is $120 and her initial offer was $130, I'll try to meet somewhere in the middle that still gives her a profit but saves me money. I'll offer $125, which gives her a $5 profit while saving me $25 compared to John's price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has moved down from $130 to $128, showing willingness to negotiate
2. Her new offer is $128, which is $22 less than John's price
3. While there might be room to negotiate further (given her cost is $120), the potential savings are getting smaller
4. There's a risk that if I push too hard, Alice might not go lower or might increase the price

Given that:
- Alice has already reduced her price twice
- The current offer is significantly better than John's price
- The potential additional savings from further negotiation might not be worth the risk

I'll accept this offer. $128 is a reasonable price that gives both parties a fair deal.
