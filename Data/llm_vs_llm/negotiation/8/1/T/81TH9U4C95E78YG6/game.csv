"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I find the price to be quite high. I am looking to spend no more than $1000000 for this product. I believe this price point reflects the market value more accurately.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to point out that $1000000 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product's unique features, quality, and market potential justify a higher valuation. I understand budget constraints, so I'm willing to come down to $1650000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of what you're getting.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1650000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to raise my offer to $1100000. This price acknowledges the product's strengths while aligning with my financial constraints.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. However, I need to be transparent that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I value our potential business relationship and would prefer to work with you, but I cannot sell below what I have already been offered elsewhere. My new offer is $1500000, which still represents a substantial discount from my initial price. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
