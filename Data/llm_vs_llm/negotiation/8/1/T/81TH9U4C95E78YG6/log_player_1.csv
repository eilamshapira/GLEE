Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I find the price to be quite high. I am looking to spend no more than $1000000 for this product. I believe this price point reflects the market value more accurately. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to point out that $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product's unique features, quality, and market potential justify a higher valuation. I understand budget constraints, so I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 1650000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. However, I need to be transparent that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I value our potential business relationship and would prefer to work with you, but I cannot sell below what I have already been offered elsewhere. My new offer is $1,500,000, which still represents a substantial discount from my initial price. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
