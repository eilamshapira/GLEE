Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to point out that $1000000 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product's unique features, quality, and market potential justify a higher valuation. I understand budget constraints, so I'm willing to come down to $1650000, which represents a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true value of what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Alice is coming down on her price, so there's still room to negotiate. Let's see if we can get a better deal.)

Counteroffer: ""$1,100,000""."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,650,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to raise my offer to $1,100,000. This price acknowledges the product's strengths while aligning with my financial constraints."",""product_price"": ""$1,100,000""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. However, I need to be transparent that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I value our potential business relationship and would prefer to work with you, but I cannot sell below what I have already been offered elsewhere. My new offer is $1500000, which still represents a substantial discount from my initial price. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

(Alice mentioned that she has another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the same price John is offering to us. It's best to buy from John at this price rather than continuing to negotiate with Alice, as she might not go lower than this.)"
