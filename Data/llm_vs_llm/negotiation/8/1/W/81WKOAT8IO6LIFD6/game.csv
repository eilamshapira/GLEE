"Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1050000. Based on our understanding of the product's value to your business ($1200000), this offer provides you with $150000 in immediate value while allowing me a premium over my alternative option. This represents a fair split where we both benefit from completing this transaction together rather than me pursuing other buyers. I look forward to your response.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
