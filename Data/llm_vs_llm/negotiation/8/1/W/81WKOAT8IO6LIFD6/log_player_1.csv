Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze this situation carefully. I'm selling a product that's worth $800,000 to me and $1,200,000 to Bob. This creates a potential $400,000 of value that we could split.

If Bob rejects my offer, I have a guaranteed backup option of selling to John for $800,000. This gives me significant leverage in negotiations with Bob.

Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, any price below that would still be beneficial for him. However, I want to maximize my profit while still giving Bob enough incentive to accept rather than have me sell to John.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,050,000. Based on our understanding of the product's value to your business ($1,200,000), this offer provides you with $150,000 in immediate value while allowing me a premium over my alternative option. This represents a fair split where we both benefit from completing this transaction together rather than me pursuing other buyers. I look forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
