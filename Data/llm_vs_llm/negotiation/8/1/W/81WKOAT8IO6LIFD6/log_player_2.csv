"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1050000. Based on our understanding of the product's value to your business ($1200000), this offer provides you with $150000 in immediate value while allowing me a premium over my alternative option. This represents a fair split where we both benefit from completing this transaction together rather than me pursuing other buyers. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
