"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $80 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $150
3. I can buy the same product from John for $80

Alice's offer ($150) is way above my maximum valuation ($80), and I have a better alternative with John's offer ($80). It would be financially unwise to accept Alice's offer when I can get the same product at a much better price that matches my valuation.
