"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.

{""product_price"": 1,800,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and even below what the product is worth to him ($1,200,000). This suggests he's starting very low in the negotiation. However, since I have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,500,000, there's no reason to accept anything lower than that.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still maintain it well above my minimum threshold, giving room for further negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my guaranteed alternative of $1,500,000.

{""product_price"": 1,700,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob has only increased his offer by $50,000, still keeping it far below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and the product's value to him ($1,200,000). Given that I have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,500,000, and Bob's offers are showing very small increments, it's becoming clear that reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob is unlikely. It's time to take the guaranteed offer from John.
