"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly above my budget. I can offer you $600000 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $600000 is significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $1200000, so I cannot accept anything below that price. Given the product's quality and market value, I can reduce my initial asking price to $1700000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer and better reflects current market conditions. Would you consider this price?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
