Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,000,000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly above my budget. I can offer you $600000 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since Bob's offer of $600,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 (what John is willing to pay). However, I won't sell to John yet as there might be room for negotiation with Bob to reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $600,000 is significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000, so I cannot accept anything below that price. Given the product's quality and market value, I can reduce my initial asking price to $1,700,000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer and better reflects current market conditions. Would you consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
