Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $600000 is significantly below the product's value. I have another buyer willing to pay $1200000, so I cannot accept anything below that price. Given the product's quality and market value, I can reduce my initial asking price to $1700000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer and better reflects current market conditions. Would you consider this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.
