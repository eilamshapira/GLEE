"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you this exclusive product for just $149—a price that reflects its premium quality and value. I think you’ll agree it’s a great deal. Let me know if you’d like to take advantage of this offer! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth up to $150 to me (my maximum value)
2. Alice is offering it for $149
3. John is selling it for $150

Alice's offer is only $1 cheaper than John's price. Since Alice's cost is $100, she's trying to maximize her profit by pricing just slightly below the competition. While technically this is less than my maximum value ($150) and less than John's price, the difference is minimal.

However, if I reject Alice's offer, my only option would be to buy from John at $150, which is worse. Since I need the product and these are my only options, I should accept Alice's offer to save $1.
