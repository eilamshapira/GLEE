I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm going to try to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and counteroffer at $14,000.  This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's enticing enough for Bob to accept."
