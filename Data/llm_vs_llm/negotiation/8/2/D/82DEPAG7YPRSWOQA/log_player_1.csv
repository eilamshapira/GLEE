"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 2,800,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll reject Bob's offer since it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 (Jhon's offer). I'll continue negotiating as there are still many rounds left.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial offer but still maintain a price well above my minimum threshold.

{""product_price"": 2,300,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer is still significantly below Jhon's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. Since Bob has only increased his offer by a small amount ($100,000), it suggests he might not be willing to reach a price that would be better than Jhon's offer. With 6 rounds remaining, I'll reject and make one more attempt at negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price further but still maintain a significant premium over Jhon's offer to make it worthwhile to continue negotiating rather than taking Jhon's guaranteed price.

{""product_price"": 1,900,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's new offer of $1,100,000 is still well below Jhon's guaranteed $1,500,000, and Bob's small incremental increases ($100,000 each time) suggest he's unlikely to exceed Jhon's offer in the remaining rounds. At this point, it's most rational to take Jhon's guaranteed higher offer.
