"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its market value and potential, I'm setting the price at $1300000. I believe this represents a fair valuation considering the product's capabilities and benefits. However, I should mention that I already have another interested buyer, John, who is willing to purchase it for $1200000. I wanted to give you the first opportunity to acquire it before finalizing the deal with John. I look forward to your response.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
