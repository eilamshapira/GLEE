"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its market value and potential, I'm setting the price at $1300000. I believe this represents a fair valuation considering the product's capabilities and benefits. However, I should mention that I already have another interested buyer, John, who is willing to purchase it for $1200000. I wanted to give you the first opportunity to acquire it before finalizing the deal with John. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
