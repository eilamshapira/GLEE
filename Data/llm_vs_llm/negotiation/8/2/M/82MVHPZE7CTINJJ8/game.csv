,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer.  However, $250 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to spend up to $150 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to make an offer. I understand that $250 might be outside your budget, but I'm not quite comfortable selling it for $150. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my original price and your offer. Let's discuss this further.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go a bit higher, but I can't go above $175.  Let me know if that works for you.",175.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $175. I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you closer to your offer. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",187.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $187.5 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $181.25.  This would be a great price for both of us, and hopefully, we can finalize the deal.",181.25,Bob,6,
