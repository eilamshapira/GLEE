Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is lower than the minimum value of $15,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $15,000, I will reject Bob's offer. However, I'm interested in negotiating further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Therefore, I will proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. Here's a revised offer."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for revising your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer, hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $13,500 is still lower than my desired price, but closer to the minimum value of $15,000 that the product is worth to me, I will consider it. However, I still think I can get a better price from Bob. Given that Bob has been willing to increase his offer, I believe there's a chance he might be willing to go even higher. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer, trying to meet him halfway between my previous offer and his current offer.
