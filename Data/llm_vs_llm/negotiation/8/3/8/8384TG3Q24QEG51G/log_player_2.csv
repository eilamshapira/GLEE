"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $14,999
2. John's price: $15,000
3. My maximum value: $15,000

Alice's offer is just $1 less than John's price and my maximum value. While it technically saves me $1 compared to buying from John, it's not a significant saving. By rejecting this offer, I might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice since the product is worth $12,000 to her, leaving room for a better deal.
