Send your offer to Bob.,"Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000 and I can always sell to John for $12,000, I'll start with a high offer to see if Bob might be willing to pay more than his valuation.

{""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is below both my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and John's guaranteed offer ($12,000), I will sell to John.
