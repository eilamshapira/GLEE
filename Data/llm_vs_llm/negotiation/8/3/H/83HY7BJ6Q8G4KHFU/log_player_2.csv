"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $100
2. My maximum value for the product is $100
3. John's fixed price is $100
4. I have 10 rounds of negotiation possible

Since Alice's initial offer equals both my maximum value and John's price, there's no advantage in accepting it immediately. I should try to negotiate for a better price with Alice. If I fail, I can always fall back to either Alice's or John's $100 offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since this is my first counteroffer, I'll start relatively low but not so low as to be unreasonable. A common negotiation strategy is to start at about 60-70% of the asking price.

{""product_price"": 65}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","This is a good development:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $100 to $90
2. This is already better than John's fixed price of $100
3. We still have 7 more rounds of negotiation possible
4. Alice's willingness to drop the price by $10 suggests there might be more room for negotiation

Since we're making progress and the current offer is already better than our alternative (John's price), but there might still be room for negotiation, I'll reject this offer and try another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has moved down from $100 to $90, showing some flexibility. I moved up from my initial $65 offer, so I should move up again to show good faith in the negotiation, but still try to get a better deal. I'll split the difference between my last offer ($65) and her current offer ($90).

{""product_price"": 77}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let's analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offers have gone from $100 → $90 → $85
2. My offers have gone from $65 → $77
3. Alice is showing willingness to negotiate but with smaller decrements now
4. The current offer of $85 is already $15 less than John's price
5. We still have 5 rounds left, but Alice's decreasing rate of concession suggests we might be approaching her limit

While there might still be some room for negotiation, the risk is that too much pushing might make Alice less willing to negotiate. $85 is a good price compared to our alternative ($100), and we've achieved a significant reduction from the initial price.
