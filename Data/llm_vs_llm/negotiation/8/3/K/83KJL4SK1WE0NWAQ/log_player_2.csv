"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product that I think you'll find really valuable. I'm asking $120 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to evaluate Alice's offer against my alternatives. 

Alice is offering the product for $120, which is exactly the maximum I'm willing to pay for it (since it's worth no more than $120 to me). John is also willing to sell me the same product for $120.

Since both offers are for the same price, and I'm indifferent between buying from Alice or John at this price, I'll accept Alice's offer since she approached me first.
