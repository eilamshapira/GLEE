Send your offer to Bob.,"Since I know the product is worth $120 to Bob and $150 to me, there's no reason to offer it to Bob for less than $150. If Bob rejects the offer (which he will, since $150 is above his valuation), I can sell it to John for $150. If I offered it for less than $150, I would be losing money compared to selling it to John.
