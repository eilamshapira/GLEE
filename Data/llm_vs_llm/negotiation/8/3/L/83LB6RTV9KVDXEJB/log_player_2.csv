"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","The product is worth no more than $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $150, which exceeds my valuation. Meanwhile, John is willing to sell me the same product for $120, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, I should buy from John instead of accepting Alice's higher-priced offer.
