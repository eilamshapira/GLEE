"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe the price of $18000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but I need to point out that your offer of $8000 is actually below my minimum acceptable price. The product's value and quality justify a higher price point. I can reduce my initial offer significantly, but I cannot go below $15000 given the product's worth. Would you be able to meet me closer to this price range?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price. However, $15000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. I'd like to propose $11500. This price reflects my serious interest in the product while also considering my financial constraints. Would you be open to discussing this price?",11500.0,Bob,4,
