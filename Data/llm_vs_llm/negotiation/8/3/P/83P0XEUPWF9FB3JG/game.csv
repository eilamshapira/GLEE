"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not sure $10000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  I'm willing to come down to $9000. This reflects a significant discount from my original offer and would still allow me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $8250.  This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Bob,4,
