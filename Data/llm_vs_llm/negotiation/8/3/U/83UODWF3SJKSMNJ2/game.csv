"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $2000000 is significantly above my budget for this product. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you consider $700000 for the product? This would give me some savings compared to my alternative option while hopefully still being profitable for you.",700000.0,Bob,2,
