"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase an exclusive product that I have available. I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $2000000 is significantly above my budget for this product. The product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you consider $700000 for the product? This would give me some savings compared to my alternative option while hopefully still being profitable for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
