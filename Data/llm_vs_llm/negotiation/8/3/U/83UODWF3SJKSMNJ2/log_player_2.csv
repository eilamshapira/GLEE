"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase an exclusive product that I have available. I'm offering it to you for $2000000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I see that Alice is offering the product for $2,000,000, which is actually higher than the $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me. It's also exactly double the price that John is willing to sell it for.

Since Alice's initial offer exceeds both the value to me and John's alternative price, I'll reject this offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget for this product. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you consider $700,000 for the product? This would give me some savings compared to my alternative option while hopefully still being profitable for you."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
