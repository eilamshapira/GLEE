"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value and rarity of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $10000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $22000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price.",22000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the reduction in price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $12000, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'd like to offer the product to you for $20000, which is a further reduction from my previous price. I believe this is a fair price, given the product's value and rarity.",20000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the further reduction in price, but I'm still above my budget. Given that I have an alternative option to buy the product for $15000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $14000. I believe this is a reasonable price, considering the product's value and the alternative option available to me.",14000.0,Bob,6,
