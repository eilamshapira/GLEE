"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. My research indicates this product is worth approximately $1,500,000 in the current market. I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1,300,000, which represents a significant value for something of this caliber. This price accounts for both the product's inherent value and saves you the time and resources you might spend searching for alternatives."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is quite interesting, the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $800000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's market value and my minimum acceptable price. As I mentioned, this product is worth around $1,500,000 in the market, and I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase it for $1,000,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $1,200,000, which still represents a $300,000 value for you compared to the market price. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our interests."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  That said, I'm afraid $1200000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Considering your other potential buyer and the value this product represents for me, how about we meet in the middle at $1000000 even?  It's a win-win. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price point that works for you. While $1,000,000 matches my alternative offer from John, I'm still looking for a better return given the product's substantial value to you. Let's be transparent - this product is worth $1,500,000 to you, which means even at $1,100,000, you'd still gain $400,000 in value. This represents a fair split of the additional value between us. At this price, we both benefit significantly from the transaction, and I'm able to justify choosing you over my guaranteed alternative."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but I need you to understand my position.  Frankly, your other offers don't factor into my budget limitations. If I were comfortable spending over $1000000, I wouldn't be spending my time negotiating â€“ I'd just buy from John directly and be done with it. To be clear, $1000000 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
