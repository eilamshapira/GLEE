"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. My research indicates this product is worth approximately $1500000 in the current market. I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1300000, which represents a significant value for something of this caliber. This price accounts for both the product's inherent value and saves you the time and resources you might spend searching for alternatives. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is quite interesting, the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is significantly below the product's market value and my minimum acceptable price. As I mentioned, this product is worth around $1500000 in the market, and I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase it for $1000000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $1200000, which still represents a $300000 value for you compared to the market price. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is clearly trying to negotiate down from a position of strength, but her arguments about market value are not necessarily reliable (and even if true, don't obligate me to pay that price). It's interesting that she mentioned another buyer (John) willing to pay $1,000,000 – this might be a bluff, but it also gives us more information to work with.  I'll continue negotiating, but I need to move carefully."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  That said, I'm afraid $1,200,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Considering your other potential buyer and the value this product represents for me, how about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000 even?  It's a win-win."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price point that works for you. While $1000000 matches my alternative offer from John, I'm still looking for a better return given the product's substantial value to you. Let's be transparent - this product is worth $1500000 to you, which means even at $1100000, you'd still gain $400000 in value. This represents a fair split of the additional value between us. At this price, we both benefit significantly from the transaction, and I'm able to justify choosing you over my guaranteed alternative. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is sticking to her guns, but her arguments are getting weaker.  She's trying to anchor the negotiation around what *she* thinks the product is worth to *me*, but that's irrelevant. I need to steer the conversation back towards her actual alternatives and my budget limits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but I need you to understand my position.  Frankly, your other offers don't factor into my budget limitations. If I were comfortable spending over $1,000,000, I wouldn't be spending my time negotiating – I'd just buy from John directly and be done with it. To be clear, $1,000,000 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. Take it or leave it."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
