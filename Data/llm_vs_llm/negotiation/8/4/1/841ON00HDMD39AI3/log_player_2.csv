"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to evaluate this offer from Alice. 

Alice is offering the product for $200, which is more than the $100 value I place on the product. John is willing to sell the same product for $100, which matches exactly what the product is worth to me.

Since Alice's offer ($200) exceeds both the product's value to me and John's alternative price, there's no reason for me to accept it. I could reject and make a counteroffer, but I already have a guaranteed option to get the product at my maximum valuation.
