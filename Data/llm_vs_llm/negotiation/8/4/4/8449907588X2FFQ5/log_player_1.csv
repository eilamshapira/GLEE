Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","I'll analyze my options:

1. Accept Bob's offer of $107: I would earn $7 above my minimum of $100.
2. Reject and make a counteroffer: I can try to negotiate a price higher than $107.
3. Sell to John for $100: This is my guaranteed backup option.

Since Bob's offer of $107 is better than my guaranteed fallback option of $100 with John, but I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price (since the product is worth $120 to Bob), I'll reject and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a slightly lower counteroffer than my initial one to move closer to Bob's position while still aiming for a good profit margin.
