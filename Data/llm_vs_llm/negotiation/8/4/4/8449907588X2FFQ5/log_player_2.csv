"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I should analyze this situation carefully.

Alice's offer is $115, which is less than the maximum $120 I'm willing to pay, and also less than John's fixed price of $120.

I have three options:
1. Accept Alice's offer of $115
2. Reject and make a counteroffer
3. Buy from John for $120

Option 3 is clearly worse than option 1, since John's price is higher.

Between options 1 and 2, I should try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer. Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, I have room to negotiate a better price that's still profitable for her.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I'm choosing to negotiate, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives Alice some profit while saving myself money.

The product costs Alice $100, and I know I can pay up to $120. Alice offered $115, but I can try to get a better price. I'll offer a price that splits the difference between Alice's cost and her initial offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I should review my position again.

Alice has reduced her asking price from $115 to $110, which is a positive development. This new price is $10 lower than John's fixed price of $120, and it's only $10 above Alice's cost of $100.

My options:
1. Accept Alice's offer of $110
2. Reject and make another counteroffer
3. Buy from John for $120 (clearly worse than option 1)

Since Alice has already moved down in price, and $110 is a reasonable offer that gives her a modest profit while saving me money compared to buying from John, I should accept this offer.
