"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be very interested in. Based on its value and what I've learned about your needs, I'm willing to offer it to you for a price of: 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $12,000, I need to evaluate if this is a good deal for me.

Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and John is willing to sell the exact same product for $8,000, Alice's offer of $12,000 is too high. I would be paying $4,000 more than the product's value to me.

Given that I can get the same product from John at exactly the maximum value I place on it ($8,000), there's no reason to accept Alice's higher offer or even continue negotiating.
