Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you Alice, for your offer. However, I was thinking of a figure more in the range of $4000. I believe this price point aligns better with my budget and the market value of similar products.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
