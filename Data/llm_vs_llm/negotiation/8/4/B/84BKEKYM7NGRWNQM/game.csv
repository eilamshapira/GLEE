"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $10000. I understand that $15000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value lies somewhere in between our initial offers. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. Let's discuss the possibility of $12500, which I think is a fair price considering the product's worth.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $11250 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,4,
