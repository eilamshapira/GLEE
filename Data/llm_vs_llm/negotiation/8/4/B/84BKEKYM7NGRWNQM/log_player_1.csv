Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its worth."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is the minimum value I have for the product, and selling it to John would also be for $10,000, I don't see a benefit in accepting Bob's offer over selling to John or vice versa in terms of price. However, negotiating further with Bob might yield a better offer. Given that Bob's initial reaction was to lower the price significantly, it suggests he might be willing to pay more than $10,000 but is testing the waters. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, aiming to find a middle ground that is more favorable to me than the initial offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $10,000. I understand that $15,000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value lies somewhere in between our initial offers. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. Let's discuss the possibility of $12,500, which I think is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $11250 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's new offer of $11,250 is getting closer to a price that I might be willing to accept, considering it's still above the minimum value I have for the product ($10,000) and John's offer. Since Bob is willing to split the difference and his offer is now $1,250 above my minimum acceptable price, it indicates a serious intent to purchase. Given that further negotiation might not yield significantly more and could potentially risk losing the sale, I'm inclined to accept this offer as it provides a reasonable profit above my baseline.
