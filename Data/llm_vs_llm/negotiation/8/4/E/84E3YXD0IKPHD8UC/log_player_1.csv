Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $150 to him and $120 to me, I'll start with a high price to leave room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

{""product_price"": 145}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","I'll reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than John's $120, there's still room for negotiation since the product is worth $150 to Bob. I think we can reach a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still try to maintain a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","I'll accept Bob's offer of $135. This is a reasonable compromise - it's significantly better than John's $120 offer, and while it's less than my target price, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.
