"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since the product is worth $8,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $10,000, I should not accept Alice's offer. Buying from John for $8,000 is the better option.

Therefore, the answer is:
```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```"
