Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. The product is worth $150 to Bob, and I can always sell it to John for $100. I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while still being within Bob's value range.

{""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob's offer of $120 is significantly better than John's fixed price of $100
2. Bob initially rejected $140, showing he's willing to negotiate but not at very high prices
3. If I reject and counter, I risk Bob walking away, leaving me with only John's $100 offer
4. $120 is a good price - it's $20 above my minimum and a reasonable split of the surplus

Given these factors, I'll accept Bob's offer of $120. It's a fair price that gives me a good profit while still giving Bob some value.
