"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product is worth a lot to me. How about we meet in the middle at $12000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9500 is close, but I can't let it go for less than $11000. I'm confident this is a fair price for the value you're getting.",11000.0,Alice,5,
