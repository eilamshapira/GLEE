"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to consider my options carefully here. The product is worth no more than $80 to me, so I shouldn't pay more than that. 

Alice is offering the product for $120, which is the full value it has to her. This is well above my maximum value of $80.

I have an alternative option to buy from John for exactly $80, which matches my maximum valuation.

Given these circumstances, there's no reason to accept Alice's high offer of $120. I could reject and make a counteroffer, but since John is already willing to sell at my maximum valuation of $80, it makes the most sense to just buy from him.
