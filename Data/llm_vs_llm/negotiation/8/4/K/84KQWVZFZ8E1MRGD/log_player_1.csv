"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $200 is much higher than I am willing to spend. How about I offer you $40 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $40. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $40
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. Since his offer of $40 is significantly lower than my initial offer of $200, I'll try to find a middle ground that is still favorable to me. My counteroffer will be $180. 

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $200 might be out of your budget, but $40 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer you the product for $180."", ""product_price"": 180}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $180 is still much higher than I am willing to pay. Let's try to find a more reasonable middle ground. I can offer you $45 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $45.

Bob's offer of $45 is still too low for me. I'll make another counteroffer, trying to bring the price closer to a mutually acceptable range. Since Bob has increased his offer from $40 to $45, I'll decrease my offer from $180 to $160, hoping to find a middle ground.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle. However, $45 is still below my target price. I'm willing to lower my price to $160. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 160}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that we are trying to find a middle ground here, but $160 is still considerably higher than what I am looking to spend. I am willing to raise my offer to $50.

Bob's offer of $50 is still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll make another counteroffer, trying to bring the price closer to a reasonable range. Since Bob has increased his offer again, I'll decrease my offer from $160 to $150.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $50 is still quite low for this product.
