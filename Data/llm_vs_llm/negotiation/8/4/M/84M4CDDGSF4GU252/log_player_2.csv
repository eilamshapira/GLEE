"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1100000. This price reflects the product's true worth while still leaving room for you to generate significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","The product is worth $1,200,000 to me and $800,000 to Alice. Alice is offering it for $1,100,000. I can buy it from John for $1,200,000 at any time.

Since Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than what I value the product at ($1,200,000) and cheaper than buying from John ($1,200,000), I should accept the offer.
