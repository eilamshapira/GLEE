"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  I'm asking for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I need to be transparent that your asking price of $2000000 is significantly above my budget and the market value I've researched. I know the product is valuable, but I can only offer $950000 for it. This is a fair price considering the alternatives available to me in the market. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $950000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I've put considerable resources into developing it, and its true worth is reflected in my initial offer. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1750000.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be candid about my situation. I have another seller, John, who's offering this same product for $1200000, which is actually my maximum budget for this purchase. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need a compelling reason to choose your offer over his. I can offer $1050000, which gives you a better deal than what I'd pay elsewhere while still keeping within my constraints. What do you say?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, this product offers significant long-term value that justifies a higher price.  While I appreciate your offer of $1050000, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the product's true worth. I'm willing to lower my price to $1600000. This is a substantial reduction, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving down in price, but I need to be completely transparent with you. I have John's firm offer of $1200000 for this exact product, and that's actually the maximum I can justify spending based on the value it brings to my business. To give you an incentive to close this deal, I'm willing to offer $1150000, which is almost at my absolute ceiling. If we can't reach an agreement near this price point, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer, as the difference becomes too significant to ignore from a business perspective.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand the position you're in, and I want to find a way for us to close this deal.  I'm willing to make a final offer of $1500000. This is my absolute bottom line, and it's a significant compromise. I believe this price offers excellent value given the potential returns you'll see from the product.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
