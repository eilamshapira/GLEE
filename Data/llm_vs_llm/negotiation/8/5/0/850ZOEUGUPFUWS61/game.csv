"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, I believe your asking price is a bit high. Given market conditions, I would like to make a counteroffer of $900000. This still provides you with a substantial profit margin while being more aligned with my budget. Would you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However, considering the product's value and market demand, I'm willing to negotiate further. What do you say to $1050000? I believe this is a reasonable compromise for both parties.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can find common ground. However, $1050000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with. I can offer $950000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer and provides you with an excellent return. This price point would work well for both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
