Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, I believe your asking price is a bit high. Given market conditions, I would like to make a counteroffer of $900000. This still provides you with a substantial profit margin while being more aligned with my budget. Would you consider this offer?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can find common ground.

This price point would work well for both of us. What do you think?
