Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll send an offer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","I'll consider Bob's counteroffer of $100. Since this is above my minimum value of $80 and higher than what John is offering, I'll accept Bob's offer.
