"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Would you be willing to consider that?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $7000 is significantly below its true value. I could meet you halfway at $8500. This is my final offer.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that $7000 was a bit low, but $8500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our previous offers, at $7750. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",7750.0,Bob,4,
