"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a great product that I think youâ€™ll love. I can offer it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to evaluate Alice's offer and make a decision that maximizes my savings, while still getting the product I need.

Alice is offering the product for $90, while John would sell it for $100. The product is worth up to $100 to me, so either option would be acceptable in terms of value.

Since Alice's offer ($90) is $10 less than John's price ($100), I should accept Alice's offer to save money.
