"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice's offer matches your maximum price, there's a chance she might be willing to sell for less. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before settling for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 100}

**Reasoning:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and provides a good starting point for negotiation. It allows room for Alice to counter and still leaves a decent margin for me to potentially reach a price that's significantly lower than $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice reducing her price indicates a willingness to negotiate.  While $120 is a reasonable price, it's worth seeing if she'd go even lower, especially since I'm aiming for under $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 110}

**Reasoning:** I'm incrementally increasing my offer to signal that I am interested while still aiming for a price well below my maximum. This keeps the negotiation moving and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility."
