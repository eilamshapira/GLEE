"Hi Bob, I'm offering my premium product to you for $14000. It's a great value considering it's worth $15000 to you. I hope we can make a deal!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $14000 is quite close to the market price of $15000. Given that we're dealing directly, I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to offer $11500 for the product. This still gives you a good profit margin, and we both benefit from the direct transaction. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $11500 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $12750. This way, we both make a fair compromise. Do you agree?",12750.0,Alice,3,
