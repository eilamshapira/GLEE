"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $14000 is quite close to the market price of $15000. Given that we're dealing directly, I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to offer $11500 for the product. This still gives you a good profit margin, and we both benefit from the direct transaction. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $12,750. This way, we both make a fair compromise. Do you agree?"", ""product_price"": 12750}"
