"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my premium product to you for $14000. It's a great value considering it's worth $15000 to you. I hope we can make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $15,000 to me (maximum I'm willing to pay)
2. Alice's offer is $14,000
3. I can buy from John for $15,000
4. The product is worth $10,000 to Alice

Alice's offer of $14,000 is quite high, considering she values it at $10,000. There's room for negotiation here. Since I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000, I should try to negotiate with Alice for a better price. Even if negotiations fail, I won't be worse off as I can still buy from John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's $14,000 but still above her value of $10,000, giving room for further negotiation while still allowing her to make a profit.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $14,000 is quite close to the market price of $15,000. Given that we're dealing directly, I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to offer $11,500 for the product. This still gives you a good profit margin, and we both benefit from the direct transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $11500 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $12750. This way, we both make a fair compromise. Do you agree? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. Alice has dropped from $14,000 to $12,750, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This is a significant improvement from the initial offer
3. The price is still well above her value ($10,000)
4. However, it's also significantly better than John's price ($15,000)
5. Alice might be willing to go a bit lower, but there's also a risk of too much back-and-forth

$12,750 represents a good compromise. While I might be able to negotiate further down, the current price already saves me $2,250 compared to buying from John. The risk of potentially damaging the negotiation for a relatively smaller additional savings doesn't seem worth it.
