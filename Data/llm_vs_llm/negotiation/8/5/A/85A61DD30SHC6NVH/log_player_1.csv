Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique qualities and potential, I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1,200,000."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the unique qualities of the product, the price you've offered is beyond my budget. I'm willing to purchase it for $800000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Considering Bob's counteroffer, and my minimum value of $800,000, I have a crucial decision to make. I need to weigh the possibility of getting a higher price through further negotiation against the risk of Bob walking away entirely, and I have to take into account the certainty of selling it to John.

Since Bob offered the minimum price I am willing to accept, I will take it.
