Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I am willing to sell it for $1,750,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1750000 is far above my budget. I want to be transparent - this product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I have another seller offering it at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $850000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
