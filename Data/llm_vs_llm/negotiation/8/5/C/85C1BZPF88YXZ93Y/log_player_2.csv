"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I am willing to sell it for $1750000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,750,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,000,000, and it's also higher than John's price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,750,000 is far above my budget. I want to be transparent - this product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and I have another seller offering it at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $850,000?"", ""product_price"": 850000}"
