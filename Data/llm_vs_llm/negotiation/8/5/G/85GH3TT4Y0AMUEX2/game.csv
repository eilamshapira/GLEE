"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2000000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in the product, $2000000 is significantly more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1000000 is significantly below my minimum. This product has the potential to generate much more value than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1750000? This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1750000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the potential value while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $1250000 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
