"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2000000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is far too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1000000 is significantly below my minimum. This product has the potential to generate much more value than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1750000? This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

Alice's counteroffer is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer but not as much as Alice is asking."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $1250000 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.

Alice is clearly unwilling to budge further. At this point, it's better to go with John's offer of $1,000,000 and avoid further negotiation.  While I'd prefer to get the product from Alice, saving $500,000 is a significant saving."
