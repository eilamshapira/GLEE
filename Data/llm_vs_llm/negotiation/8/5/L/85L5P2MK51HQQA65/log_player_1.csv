Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in purchasing this product. I believe it's a valuable asset and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a fair price. How about we start with an offer of $20,000?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $6000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
