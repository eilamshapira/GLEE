Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that the product is of high quality, but I was thinking more along the lines of a price closer to its market value. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000, considering the product's value to me and the current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must decline your offer of $900,000 as it's below the minimum value I can accept. The product is worth at least $1,000,000, which is also what another buyer, John, is willing to pay. Given the product's quality and market value, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which I believe is a fair price. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for reconsidering and reducing the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think $1150000 is a bit steep for my budget. Considering the product's value to me and the fact that John is willing to sell it for $1000000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your continued interest, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but I need to clarify something: John isn't selling the product - he's actually another buyer willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This confirms the market value I mentioned. While I appreciate your improved offer of $950,000, it still falls short of what I can accept. Since we both seem interested in finding middle ground, I'll reduce my price to $1,050,000. This is very close to the market value and represents excellent value for a product worth $1,000,000 to you. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the clarification about John, Alice. I understand that he's another buyer, not a seller. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering the product's value to me and the market value, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm hoping it's closer to what you're looking for. I'm still open to negotiating, but I also have to consider the alternative of buying from John for $1000000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your continued interest in the product. I think we're getting closer to an agreement. Just to clarify again, John isn't selling the product - he's another buyer who's willing to pay me $1,000,000 for it. This is why I can't accept less than that amount, as it would make more financial sense for me to sell to John. Since we've been negotiating in good faith and I'd prefer to do business with you, I'm willing to offer you the product at $1,020,000. This is just slightly above the alternative I have and represents my best offer given the circumstances. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1020000}"
