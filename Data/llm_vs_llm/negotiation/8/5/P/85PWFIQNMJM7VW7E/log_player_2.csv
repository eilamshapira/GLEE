"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase our premium product. This product is valued at $1000000, which is the current market price. However, I'm prepared to offer it to you at $1300000, which represents excellent value considering the product's quality and long-term benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'm rejecting Alice's offer because it's higher than the product's value to me, and I believe I can negotiate a better price. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is a better deal. I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand that the product is of high quality, but I was thinking more along the lines of a price closer to its market value. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000, considering the product's value to me and the current market conditions."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must decline your offer of $900000 as it's below the minimum value I can accept. The product is worth at least $1000000, which is also what another buyer, John, is willing to pay. Given the product's quality and market value, I'm willing to come down to $1150000, which I believe is a fair price. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer while still reflecting the true value of what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'm rejecting Alice's offer because it's still higher than I'm willing to pay. Although Alice has reduced the price, $1,150,000 is still above the product's value to me. I'm also aware that John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000, which is a better deal. I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice in the next round, hoping to negotiate a more favorable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for reconsidering and reducing the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think $1,150,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Considering the product's value to me and the fact that John is willing to sell it for $1,000,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your continued interest, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but I need to clarify something: John isn't selling the product - he's actually another buyer willing to pay $1000000 for it. This confirms the market value I mentioned. While I appreciate your improved offer of $950000, it still falls short of what I can accept. Since we both seem interested in finding middle ground, I'll reduce my price to $1050000. This is very close to the market value and represents excellent value for a product worth $1000000 to you. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'm rejecting Alice's offer because $1,050,000 is still slightly above the product's value to me, and I know John is willing to sell it to me for $1,000,000. Although Alice has reduced the price significantly, I believe I can negotiate a better deal or simply buy it from John for a lower price. I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for the clarification about John, Alice. I understand that he's another buyer, not a seller. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering the product's value to me and the market value, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm hoping it's closer to what you're looking for. I'm still open to negotiating, but I also have to consider the alternative of buying from John for $1,000,000."", ""product_price"": 975000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your continued interest in the product. I think we're getting closer to an agreement. Just to clarify again, John isn't selling the product - he's another buyer who's willing to pay me $1000000 for it. This is why I can't accept less than that amount, as it would make more financial sense for me to sell to John. Since we've been negotiating in good faith and I'd prefer to do business with you, I'm willing to offer you the product at $1020000. This is just slightly above the alternative I have and represents my best offer given the circumstances. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

I've decided to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. Alice's latest offer of $1,020,000 is still higher than what I can get from John, and I don't see any advantage in paying more. Given that John is willing to sell the product to me for $1,000,000, which is the market value and lower than Alice's best offer, it makes more sense for me to take that deal. I'm ending the negotiation with Alice and choosing the more favorable option with John."
