Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic decision here. If Bob rejects my offer, I still have the safety net of selling to John for $1,200,000. Since that's my minimum acceptable value, I should price the product high enough to potentially earn more than my fallback option.

I'll offer a price that's reasonably higher than my minimum, which gives me a chance at greater profit while knowing I won't lose money if Bob declines.
