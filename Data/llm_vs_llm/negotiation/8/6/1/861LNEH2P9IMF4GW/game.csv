"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a lower price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $10000 to me. Let's make this happen!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to meet you in the middle - how about $8500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I am too. $8500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8750? This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",8750.0,Alice,5,
