Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make an offer to Bob for my product. Since the product is worth no less than $800,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price, I should set my price above this reservation value.

I don't know Bob's valuation, but I'll set a price that gives me a good profit while potentially being attractive to Bob. If he rejects it, I still have my guaranteed $800,000 from John.
