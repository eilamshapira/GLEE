"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for Round 1:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll love! I'm willing to sell it to you for $150."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Okay, considering Bob's counteroffer of $80, I have a decision to make. Here's my thought process:

*   **My Minimum:** The product is worth $100 to me, and I won't sell for less than that. Bob's offer is below that.
*   **John's Offer:** I can sell to John for $100 immediately.
*   **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting Bob keeps the negotiation alive, but risks getting nothing or a lower price than John's offer.

Given that the product is worth $100 to me, and John is offering $100, I should not accept Bob's $80 offer.

Therefore, my decision is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in Round 3:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate it. However, I'm willing to go down to $140 for the product."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I can meet you halfway and offer $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Okay, here's my analysis of Bob's $90 offer in Round 4:

*   **My Minimum:** The product is worth at least $100 to me.
*   **John's Offer:** John is still offering $100, which is better than Bob's offer.
*   **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks getting less than $100, or potentially nothing.

Given that John's offer is guaranteed, and it meets my minimum, I'll sell to John.

Therefore, my decision is:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
