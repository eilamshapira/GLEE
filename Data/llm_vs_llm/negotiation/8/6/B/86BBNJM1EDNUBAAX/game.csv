"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate that you're interested. However, $100 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to meet you halfway, but $110 is still a little too low. I can go down to $115, but that's as low as I can go. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,5,
