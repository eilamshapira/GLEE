"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $14500?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a fair price. I'm getting closer to considering your offer, but I still need to get a bit more for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $15500? I think this is a reasonable price, considering the product's value.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm getting closer to your price, but $15500 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about we split the difference and settle on $15250? This would be a good deal for both of us.",15250.0,Bob,6,
