Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a price that works for both of us. $13,000 is closer to my minimum, but I still think the product is worth more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 16500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $14500?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. $14,500 is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'll try to meet Bob in the middle again and see if we can reach an agreement. 

(I'll send a new counteroffer in the next round)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a fair price. I'm getting closer to considering your offer, but I still need to get a bit more for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $15500? I think this is a reasonable price, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm getting closer to your price, but $15500 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about we split the difference and settle on $15250? This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

$15,250 is a good price, and I'm willing to accept it. We've negotiated back and forth, and I think we've found a fair price for both of us. I don't want to risk losing the sale by pushing for more, especially since we're running out of rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price for the product."
