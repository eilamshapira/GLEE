"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $6000 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for. This product is truly top-of-the-line and offers significant value. How about we meet halfway at $10500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to me and the fact that we're trying to meet in the middle.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I need to be fair to myself as well.  This product is worth a significant investment. How about we split the difference again and land at $9000?  That's my final offer.",9000.0,Alice,5,
