"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $10000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While $10000 is lower than I'm hoping for, I understand budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $16000.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $16000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $11000? This is close to my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, we are getting closer. While $11000 is still a bit below my target, I'm willing to work with you. Let's try $14000. This is a significant step down from my original offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
