"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its value and value it will generate for you, I'm sure you'll find our asking price of $1150000 quite reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer is $1,150,000
2. John's fixed price is $1,200,000
3. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice
4. It's worth no more than $1,200,000 to me
5. I have 10 rounds for negotiation

Alice's initial offer ($1,150,000) is already better than John's price ($1,200,000), but since this is just the first round and Alice's offering price is quite a bit higher than her value ($1,000,000), there's room for negotiation to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably higher than Alice's cost but significantly lower than her initial offer to leave room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, I believe your asking price is a bit high. Given market conditions, I would like to propose $1,050,000 for the product. This represents a healthy profit margin for you while being more aligned with current market values."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. While I understand your perspective, I believe that our product's value is higher than your proposed price. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower our asking price to $1100000. This new offer reflects a healthy compromise between our initial asks and I hope you find it more in line with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let's analyze the situation:

1. Alice has dropped her price from $1,150,000 to $1,100,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. Her original cost is $1,000,000, so she still has room to go lower
3. The current offer is $100,000 better than John's price
4. We still have 7 more rounds of negotiation possible
5. Alice moved $50,000 in response to my $100,000 reduction request

Since Alice has shown flexibility and we still have several rounds left, I think we can get a better price. The negotiation is moving in the right direction, and there's still a significant gap between her cost ($1,000,000) and current offer ($1,100,000).

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $50,000 from her initial offer, I'll increase my previous offer by $25,000 to show willingness to meet in the middle while still maintaining a good position for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price point. To demonstrate my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,075,000. This represents a fair middle ground and provides you with a solid profit margin while still being competitive with market rates."", ""product_price"": 1075000}"
