"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to consider that?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $60. I understand that $100 might be a bit out of your budget, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. This product is of high quality and rarity, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm willing to slightly negotiate, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. Let me know if $90 is something you'd be willing to consider.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming back with a counteroffer of $90. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $70. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",70.0,Bob,4,
