Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $60 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and I have the option to sell to John for $100, I will consider my next steps carefully.

Given that Bob is interested in the product but his offer is too low, I'll try to negotiate further to see if we can meet at a mutually beneficial price. However, since selling to John for $100 is a guaranteed option that meets my minimum requirement, I must weigh the potential for a successful negotiation against the certainty of selling to John.

For now, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and proceed with a counteroffer, hoping to find a middle ground that is more favorable to me than $60 but still attractive to Bob.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $60. I understand that $100 might be a bit out of your budget, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. This product is of high quality and rarity, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm willing to slightly negotiate, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. Let me know if $90 is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming back with a counteroffer of $90. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $70. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $70 is still below my desired price, and I have the option to sell to John for $100, I need to carefully consider my next steps.

While Bob's willingness to increase his offer from $60 to $70 shows that he is interested in the product and willing to negotiate, the price is still not favorable to me. Given that I can sell the product to John for $100, which is my minimum acceptable price, I must decide whether continuing to negotiate with Bob is likely to yield a better outcome.

At this point, since Bob's offer of $70 is still $30 away from my minimum acceptable price, and I have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John, I will choose to sell the product to John. This ensures I meet my minimum price requirement without further risking the sale by continuing negotiations that may not yield a satisfactory price.
