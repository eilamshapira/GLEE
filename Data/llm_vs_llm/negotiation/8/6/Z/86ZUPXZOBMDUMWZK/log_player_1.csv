"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $100. It's a great product and I think you'll find it very useful. Are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $100 is a bit steep for me. How about $70? I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

# Explanation:

# The product is worth no less than $80 to me, so accepting Bob's offer of $70 would result in a loss.
# I choose not to sell the product to John yet, as there are still 9 rounds left for negotiation with Bob.
# In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price point that is profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $70 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $85. It's a great value for the product and I think you'll be very happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}"
