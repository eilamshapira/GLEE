"Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000, considering the market value and my budget. I'm looking forward to your response.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but $8000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18000, which is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and market demand.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid to $10000. However, I still believe the product is worth more. I'm willing to make a concession and lower my price further. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16000, which is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and market demand. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal soon.",16000.0,Alice,5,
