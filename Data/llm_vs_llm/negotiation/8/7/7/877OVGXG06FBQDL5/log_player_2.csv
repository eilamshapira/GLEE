"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, make a counteroffer, or buy from John.

Given that:
- The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
- Alice is offering it for $15,000
- John is willing to sell it for $12,000

Alice's offer of $15,000 is higher than both John's price and the product's value to me. I should either make a counteroffer to Alice or buy from John immediately.

Since I have the option to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price than John's $12,000, I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice that's well below what she's asking but still gives room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her offer from $15,000 to $14,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, her offer is still higher than John's price of $12,000, and the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me.

Since Alice is willing to come down in price, I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. This gives me a chance to potentially get a better price than John's $12,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my counteroffer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still try to get a price below John's offer.
