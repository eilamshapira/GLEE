"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our product at $15000. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($8,000), it doesn't make sense to accept this offer. Additionally, buying from John for $8,000 is an option, but I'd like to try negotiating with Alice first to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and closer to my target price. Since I'm willing to pay up to $8,000, I'll start by offering a lower price to leave room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $6,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 6000}"
