Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is above my budget. Knowing you have an alternative buyer at $800000, I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
