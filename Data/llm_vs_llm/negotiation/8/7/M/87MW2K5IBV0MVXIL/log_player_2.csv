"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you this product for $1200000. Please let me know if you’d like to accept this offer or if you have a counteroffer in mind. (Just so you know, if we can’t reach an agreement, I have an alternative buyer ready at $800000.) 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,000,000, I will reject her offer. Additionally, knowing that Alice has an alternative buyer at $800,000 gives me a bit of leverage, as it suggests she might be willing to negotiate down to that price or possibly even lower to secure a sale with me instead of risking the alternative buyer backing out.

Therefore, my decision is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice has mentioned an alternative buyer at $800,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than her initial offer but still shows my interest in purchasing the product. My goal is to save as much money as possible while still being a more attractive option than the alternative buyer.

Considering my maximum budget is $1,000,000 and aiming to negotiate a good deal, I'll start by offering a price that is below the alternative buyer's price, to give Alice an incentive to negotiate with me rather than risking the sale with the other buyer.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is above my budget. Knowing you have an alternative buyer at $800,000, I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market and my budget."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
