"Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I'm offering to you first. This is a unique opportunity as I believe it could be of significant value to you. I'm asking for $2000000 for this product. This offer allows you to secure it before I open negotiations with other interested parties. Would you like to proceed with this purchase?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value to me.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand budget considerations, I should mention that John has already offered me $1000000 for this product. Given its unique value, I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial price. I can offer it to you for $1500000, which represents a substantial discount from my original ask. This product has exceptional potential for the right buyer, and I believe you could benefit tremendously from it. Would this price point work better for you?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1500000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the same price I could buy the product from John.  If you're willing to accept this offer, I'm ready to move forward.  Let me know your decision.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
