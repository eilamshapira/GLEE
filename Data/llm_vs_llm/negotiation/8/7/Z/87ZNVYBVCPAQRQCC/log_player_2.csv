Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand budget considerations, I should mention that John has already offered me $1000000 for this product. Given its unique value, I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial price. I can offer it to you for $1500000, which represents a substantial discount from my original ask. This product has exceptional potential for the right buyer, and I believe you could benefit tremendously from it. Would this price point work better for you?
