"Hello Bob, I have a quality product to offer you today. Based on market value and its features, I'm offering it to you for $220. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and benefits. Let me know if you're interested.",220.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. Considering I can get a similar product from another seller for $80, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $60. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to meet me at this price point.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $60 is significantly below the product's value. While you mentioned a similar product for $80 elsewhere, I can assure you that our product offers superior quality and features. Given that this product is worth no less than $150 to me, I simply can't go that low. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer to $190. This represents a significant discount from my original price and reflects the true value of what you're getting.",190.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price to $190. However, it's still above my budget for this product. You mentioned that the product is worth no less than $150 to you, which gives me a better understanding of your position. Considering this, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your minimum value. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $105. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your improved offer and your attempt to find middle ground. However, $105 is still below what I can accept for this product. Given that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $150, I need to be realistic about the market value. I can offer you the product for $160, which is only slightly above what I could get elsewhere. This represents my best price and gives you the opportunity to acquire this quality product at a fair market value.",160.0,Alice,5,
