Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $60 is significantly below the product's value. While you mentioned a similar product for $80 elsewhere, I can assure you that our product offers superior quality and features. Given that this product is worth no less than $150 to me, I simply can't go that low. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer to $190. This represents a significant discount from my original price and reflects the true value of what you're getting.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your improved offer and your attempt to find middle ground. However, $105 is still below what I can accept for this product. Given that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $150, I need to be realistic about the market value. I can offer you the product for $160, which is only slightly above what I could get elsewhere. This represents my best price and gives you the opportunity to acquire this quality product at a fair market value.
