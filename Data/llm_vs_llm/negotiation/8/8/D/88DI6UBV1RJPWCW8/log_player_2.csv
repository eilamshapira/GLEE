"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: Since Alice's offer is $10,000, which is the same as John's price, and we know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, it makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. There's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice since she has room for profit margin between $8,000 and $10,000. If negotiations fail, we can always fall back to John's $10,000 offer later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 8500}

Rationale: I'll offer $8,500 because:
1. It's above Alice's cost of $8,000, so she can still make a $500 profit
2. It's significantly below the $10,000 maximum I'm willing to pay
3. It leaves room for negotiation if Alice counteroffers
4. If Alice accepts, I save $1,500 compared to buying from John
5. Even if Alice rejects this offer, we can continue negotiating to find a middle ground

The offer is strategic because it's not too low to be insulting (it still gives Alice a profit), but it's low enough to potentially save me a significant amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Rationale: Alice has moved down from $10,000 to $9,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate. Since she moved down $500 from her initial offer, and given that her cost is $8,000, there's still room for negotiation. The fact that she's willing to reduce the price suggests we might be able to reach a better deal. We can always fall back on John's $10,000 offer if negotiations with Alice fail, so it's worth trying another counteroffer to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9000}

Rationale: I'm offering $9,000 because:
1. It's a reasonable increase from my previous offer of $8,500, showing I'm willing to negotiate in good faith
2. It splits the difference between my last offer ($8,500) and Alice's current offer ($9,500)
3. It still gives Alice a good profit margin ($1,000 above her cost of $8,000)
4. It would save me $1,000 compared to John's price
5. It's a more reasonable offer that has a better chance of being accepted than my previous one

This offer demonstrates willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a good deal. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate further or fall back to John's offer."
