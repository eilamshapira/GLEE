You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and Alice's initial offer is $15,000, which is significantly higher than my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. I will proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of negotiating a better price.
