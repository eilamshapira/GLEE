"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and Alice's initial offer is $12,000, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $11,000 is still above my budget of $8,000. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $8,000, I don't see a reason to accept Alice's offer. I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer that is closer to my target price of $8,000, but still slightly higher than my previous offer to show that I'm willing to negotiate.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's new offer of $10,500 is still above my budget of $8,000. At this point, I don't think Alice is willing to go as low as I want, and I have a better option available. Buying the product from John for $8,000 seems like the best choice, as it's within my budget and I don't have to continue negotiating.
