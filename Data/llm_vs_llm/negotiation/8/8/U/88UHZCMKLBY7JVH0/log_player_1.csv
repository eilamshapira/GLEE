Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 180} 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($120). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts, I get a great deal. If he counters, I can start working my way down while still aiming for a price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $100 is far below both my minimum price and his own perceived value. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and prepare a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 160}

**Reasoning:** I'm coming down from my initial offer but still aiming high. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate to accept a low price. This offer is still comfortably above both my minimum and John's offer, giving me room to maneuver."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for less than my fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 145}

**Reasoning:** I'm dropping my price closer to my minimum but staying above John's offer.  This signals to Bob that I'm getting closer to my limit, encouraging him to make a more serious offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly unwilling to meet my price point.  While I might be able to negotiate him up a little more, it's unlikely to be a significant increase from $115.  Selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed win at this point and saves me further negotiation effort."
