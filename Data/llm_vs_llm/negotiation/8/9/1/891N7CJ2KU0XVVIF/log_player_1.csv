"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm offering for sale. Given its value and features, I'm offering it to you for $180."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, Iâ€™m looking to buy the product for no more than $100. Would you be willing to sell it for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. The product is worth $150 to me, and I can always sell it to John for that price, so I cannot accept $100. However, I'll try to negotiate with Bob to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $100 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to work with you. Given the product's value, I can offer it to you for $160, which is a significant reduction from my initial price."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still can't go higher than $100. Can we possibly meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob is firm on his $100 offer, which is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and he doesn't seem willing to negotiate upward, it's best to take John's guaranteed offer of $150. This ensures I don't lose money on the deal."
