"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get more than my minimum of $100.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Given that Bob's offer of $120 is above my minimum value of $100 and represents a reasonable negotiation from his initial rejection of $180, I'll accept this offer. It's better than my guaranteed $100 from John, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing this acceptable deal.
