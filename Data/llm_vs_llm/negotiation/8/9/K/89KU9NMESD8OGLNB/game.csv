"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product which I believe will be of significant value to you. Based on market research and the product's quality, I'm offering it to you for $14000.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, I was hoping to purchase it for a lower price. How about $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and your offer. While I appreciate your proposal of $12000, I need to get closer to my asking price given the true value of this product. I can come down to $13500, which I believe is fair considering the $15000 value you'll receive. This still represents a good deal with a $1500 return on your investment.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still believe the price is a bit high for my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $11500. Can we work together on this?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand budget considerations are important. I've thought about your offer and can meet you partway. I can go down to $13000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. This gives you a clear $2000 in value while still allowing me to receive a fair price. Given we're halfway through our negotiation window, I think this represents a reasonable compromise for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your offer of $13000, but I'm still looking for a better deal. How about we settle on $12500? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",12500.0,Bob,6,
