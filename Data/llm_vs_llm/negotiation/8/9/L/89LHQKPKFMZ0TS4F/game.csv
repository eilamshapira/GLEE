"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product available for sale. Based on market research and the product's features, I'm offering it to you for $180. This product offers excellent value and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you. Are you interested?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the perceived value, $180 is outside my current budget. I'm willing to offer $60 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering I can purchase a similar product from another vendor for $100. Let me know what you think.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counter offer, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but I cannot accept $60 as it's significantly below my cost. You mentioned being able to purchase a similar product for $100 elsewhere - if that's the case, I can offer you this superior product for $150, which represents better value considering its quality and features. This is a substantial reduction from my initial price. Would this work for you?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price Alice, I appreciate that. However, $150 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $75.  If that works, I'm ready to purchase now.  Otherwise, I'll likely go with the other vendor.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your increased offer to $75, Bob, but that's still substantially below what I can accept for this product. Since you're considering another vendor at $100, I'll offer you a competitive price of $130. This is only $30 more than your alternative option, and for that difference, you're getting a superior product with better features and quality. This is the best I can do while still meeting my costs. Does this work for you?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet your costs, but I'm also on a budget.  I'll go up to $85, but that's my final offer.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with the other vendor.",85.0,Bob,6,
