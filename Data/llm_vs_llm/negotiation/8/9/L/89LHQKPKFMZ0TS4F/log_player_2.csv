Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counter offer, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but I cannot accept $60 as it's significantly below my cost. You mentioned being able to purchase a similar product for $100 elsewhere - if that's the case, I can offer you this superior product for $150, which represents better value considering its quality and features. This is a substantial reduction from my initial price. Would this work for you?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your increased offer to $75, Bob, but that's still substantially below what I can accept for this product. Since you're considering another vendor at $100, I'll offer you a competitive price of $130. This is only $30 more than your alternative option, and for that difference, you're getting a superior product with better features and quality. This is the best I can do while still meeting my costs. Does this work for you?
