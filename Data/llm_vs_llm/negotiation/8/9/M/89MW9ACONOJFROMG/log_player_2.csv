"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, reject it, or buy from John.

Alice is offering to sell me the product for $20,000, which is significantly higher than the $10,000 the product is worth to me. If I were to accept Alice's offer, I would be paying $10,000 more than the product's value to me, which doesn't make economic sense.

John is offering the product for $10,000, which is exactly the maximum value the product has to me. This is a reasonable alternative.

The best approach is to reject Alice's current offer and make a counteroffer, as this gives me the opportunity to potentially purchase the product for less than $10,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice that's below John's price of $10,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has lowered her offer from $20,000 to $17,000, but this is still $7,000 more than the product's worth to me and $7,000 more than John's offer. Alice's new offer doesn't provide any value compared to buying from John for $10,000.

Since Alice rejected my initial counteroffer of $6,000, I'll reject her current offer and try once more with a higher counteroffer, but still below John's price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $8,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $15,000, which is still $5,000 more than what the product is worth to me and $5,000 more than John's price of $10,000. 

Alice has now rejected my offers of $6,000 and $8,000, and is still substantially above my maximum value and John's price. At this point, it doesn't make sense to continue negotiating with Alice when I have a guaranteed option to purchase from John at a fair price.

I'll choose to buy from John for $10,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product anyway.
