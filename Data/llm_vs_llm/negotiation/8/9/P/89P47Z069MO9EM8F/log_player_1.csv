Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob and $1,200,000 to me, there's a $300,000 surplus that can be split in the negotiation. I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while still being potentially acceptable to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1,400,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze this:
1. Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is $100,000 more than John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000
2. Bob's current offer is $200,000 less than what the product is worth to him ($1,500,000)
3. There might be room to negotiate for a better price, but there's also a risk of Bob walking away

Since Bob has shown willingness to negotiate and his current offer is already better than John's, I'll reject and make a counteroffer. The difference between his offer and the product's value to him suggests there's still room for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that splits the difference between Bob's last offer ($1,300,000) and my initial offer ($1,400,000), while still leaving some room for potential further negotiation.
