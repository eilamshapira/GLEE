"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,400,000 is better than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Alice's offer is still above her desired price, and there's a chance to get it lower.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer allows for potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a good deal.  It's still less than John's price and closer to my desired price point.  Further negotiation might get the price down a little more, but the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it."
