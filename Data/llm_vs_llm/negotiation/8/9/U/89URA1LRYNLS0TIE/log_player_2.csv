"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still early in the negotiation. There's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower, especially since we have plenty of rounds left. We can risk a counteroffer to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 800000 
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within a reasonable range for negotiation. It allows us to gauge Alice's lower limit and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but slowly. Her latest offer only shaved off $100,000 from her initial price.  We still have plenty of rounds to negotiate, and we're aiming for a much better deal.  We'll continue to counter-offer aggressively."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're splitting the difference between our last offer and her counter-offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a significantly lower price."

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but we're still not at a price point that feels like a steal. Her concessions are getting smaller, but we have time on our side. We'll counteroffer again and see how she responds."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""product_price"": 950000
