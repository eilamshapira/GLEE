"Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Since both Alice and John are offering the product at $800,000 (which is my maximum acceptable price), and their offers are identical, I might as well accept Alice's offer. There's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other, so I'll go with the current offer from Alice."
