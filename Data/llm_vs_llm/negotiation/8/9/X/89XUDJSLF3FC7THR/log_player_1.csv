"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","This is a good offer from Bob - $11,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 (John's offer) and only slightly lower than my initial offer. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Bob might lower his offer or walk away. I'll accept this favorable deal.
