"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, I believe your asking price is a bit high. Given that I have other options available, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10500. This would still provide you with a good profit margin while giving me a fair price for the product.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I need to consider my bottom line as well. The product is worth significantly more than $10500. However, I'm willing to meet you partway. I can offer you the product for $11000, which represents a $500 discount from my initial offer and would still provide you with $1000 in value based on the product's worth to you. This seems like a fair compromise for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. While $11000 is better, I think we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10750. This gives you a healthy profit margin while still being a fair price for me. What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your willingness to negotiate. I can see we're getting closer to an agreement. However, I still need to consider the true value of this product. I'm willing to lower my price to $10900. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and is only $150 more than your last proposal. At this price, you would still gain $1100 in value from the purchase. I believe this is a fair deal that benefits both of us.",10900.0,Alice,5,
