Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, I believe your asking price is a bit high. Given that I have other options available, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10500. This would still provide you with a good profit margin while giving me a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I need to consider my bottom line as well. The product is worth significantly more than $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you partway. I can offer you the product for $11,000, which represents a $500 discount from my initial offer and would still provide you with $1,000 in value based on the product's worth to you. This seems like a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your willingness to negotiate shows we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. While $11000 is better, I think we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10750. This gives you a healthy profit margin while still being a fair price for me. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and your willingness to negotiate. I can see we're getting closer to an agreement. However, I still need to consider the true value of this product. I'm willing to lower my price to $10,900. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and is only $150 more than your last proposal. At this price, you would still gain $1,100 in value from the purchase. I believe this is a fair deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10900}"
