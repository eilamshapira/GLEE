Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 15000}

Rationale: Since I know that:
1. The product is worth $10,000 to Bob
2. I can guarantee selling it to John for $15,000
3. The product is worth no less than $15,000 to me

There's no reason for me to offer Bob a price lower than $15,000. Even if Bob rejects the offer (which he likely will since it's above his valuation), I can sell to John for the same amount. Offering a lower price would only reduce my profit without providing any benefit."
