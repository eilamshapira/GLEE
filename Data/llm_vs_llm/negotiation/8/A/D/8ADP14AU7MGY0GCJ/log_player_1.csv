"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

{""product_price"": 1,500,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer of $700,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Since I have John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000, which is higher than Bob's valuation of $800,000, continuing negotiations with Bob is unlikely to result in a better outcome than selling to John.
