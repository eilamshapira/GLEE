"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's initial offer is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and I have the option to buy the product from John for the same price, I don't see any benefit in accepting Alice's offer immediately. However, I also don't want to give up the potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of getting a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both Alice and me, I'll start by offering half of that amount.
