"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to buy the product for $600000. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",600000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $600000 is below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $1000000 for this exceptional product. Let me know if this works for you.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the value this product brings justifies a higher investment. I'm willing to lower the price to $950000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price. However, $950000 is still above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'd like to propose a price of $775000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm looking forward to your response.",775000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $775000 is still below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which I believe is a fair compromise given the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. I'm willing to lower the price further to $875000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects the high value of the product. Let me know if this price works for you.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $875000 is still a bit above my target price. Considering your last offer and my previous counteroffer, I'd like to propose a price of $812500, but then I thought I can do a bit better, I am willing to meet you at $820000 and that is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.",820000.0,Bob,6,
"Thank you, Bob, for your final offer. I accept the price of $820000. It's a pleasure doing business with you, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a valuable investment.",,Alice,6,AcceptOffer
