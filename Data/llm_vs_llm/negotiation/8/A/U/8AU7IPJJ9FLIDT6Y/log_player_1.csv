"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, I will reject his offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll try to meet Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. Since he offered $100 and I initially offered $200, I'll make a counteroffer of $175, but to be more competitive, I will offer $165, and then further reduce it to $160, but to be more reasonable I will make a counteroffer of $165 - $5 = $160.
