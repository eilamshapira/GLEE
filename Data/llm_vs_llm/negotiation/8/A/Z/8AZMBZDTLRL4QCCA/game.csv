"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18000 is quite high for my budget. I would be willing to pay $10000 for the product. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more aligned with my budget constraints.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget concerns, Bob. However, the value of the product is significant. How about we meet closer to the middle? I can offer it to you for $16500.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $16500 is still too high for me. Given the market conditions and my budget, I can offer $11000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair value for the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your increased offer, Bob. I really want to make this work for both of us. My best price for you is $15000, which is also what I can get from another buyer. I hope you can see the value and meet me at this price.",15000.0,Alice,5,
