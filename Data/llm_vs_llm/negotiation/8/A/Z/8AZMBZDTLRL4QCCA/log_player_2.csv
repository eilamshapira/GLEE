"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you the product at a competitive price. Let’s start the negotiation at $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's alternative offer ($12,000), it would not be rational to accept this offer. While I could buy from John immediately, it might be worth trying to negotiate with Alice first to potentially get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably below my maximum value while leaving room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18,000 is quite high for my budget. I would be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more aligned with my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget concerns, Bob. However, the value of the product is significant. How about we meet closer to the middle? I can offer it to you for $16500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $16,500 is still well above both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's offer ($12,000). While Alice did reduce the price, it's still not in an acceptable range. Since there's still room for negotiation and several rounds left, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still stay well below my maximum value to maintain room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $16,500 is still too high for me. Given the market conditions and my budget, I can offer $11,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair value for the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your increased offer, Bob. I really want to make this work for both of us. My best price for you is $15000, which is also what I can get from another buyer. I hope you can see the value and meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's offer of $15,000 is still above both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's guaranteed offer ($12,000). While Alice has revealed that this is her cost basis, it doesn't change the fact that I have a better alternative. At this point, since Alice seems unwilling to go below $15,000 (her cost), and I have a guaranteed option of $12,000 from John, it makes the most sense to take John's offer rather than continue negotiating.
