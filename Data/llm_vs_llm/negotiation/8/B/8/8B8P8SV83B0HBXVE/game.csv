"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $100 is a bit high for me. Given that I can find similar products for less elsewhere, would you consider selling it for $70? This would be a fair price that works for both of us.",70.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob! I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer you the product for $90. Let me know your thoughts!",90.0,Alice,3,
