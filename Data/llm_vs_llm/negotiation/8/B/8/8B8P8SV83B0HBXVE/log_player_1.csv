Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $100 is a bit high for me. Given that I can find similar products for less elsewhere, would you consider selling it for $70? This would be a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
