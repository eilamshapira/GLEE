"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product that I believe you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice is offering the product for $100, which is above my maximum value of $80, and John is offering it for $80 (which equals my maximum value), I should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price. If I can't get a better price from Alice, I can always buy from John at $80.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than John's price but still reasonable given Alice's initial offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $100 is a bit high for me. Given that I can find similar products for less elsewhere, would you consider selling it for $70? This would be a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer you the product for $90. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's new offer of $90 is still above John's price of $80 (and above my maximum value), and I know I can definitely get it for $80 from John, I should take John's offer. Alice seems unlikely to go below $80 given that her counteroffer is still quite high at $90.
