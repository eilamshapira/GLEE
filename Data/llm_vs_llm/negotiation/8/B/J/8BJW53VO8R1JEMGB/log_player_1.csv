Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I'm trying to meet you closer to the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. I can go up to $1000000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you can work with.

Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the highest he's willing to go and it's still below what I could get from John, but further negotiations are unlikely to yield a better result, I'll accept Bob's offer to ensure a sale."
