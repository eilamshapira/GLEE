"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep, but I believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a little outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $10500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10800. This price reflects the product's value and takes into account our negotiation so far. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10800.0,Alice,5,
