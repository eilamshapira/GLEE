Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems interesting, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $9000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $9,000 is lower than my initial offer, but I'm still interested in negotiating with him. My counteroffer will be $11,000. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.""}"

Bob's offer:

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $10,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, but I'm getting closer to a price that I might be willing to accept. My counteroffer will be $10,800.
