Send your offer to Bob.,"{
    ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm offering for sale. Given its value and features, I'm offering it to you for $180. Would you like to purchase it at this price?"",
    ""product_price"": 180
}

Rationale: Since the product is worth $150 to me and I know I can sell it to John for $150, there's no reason to offer it to Bob for less. I'm offering it at $180 to see if Bob might accept a higher price, but if he rejects (which is likely since it's worth only $80 to him), I can still sell it to John for $150 without any loss."
