"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique and valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it at $2000000, which represents an excellent investment opportunity based on its market potential and intrinsic value. I'd be happy to discuss the details further if you have any questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's offer of $2,000,000 exceeds the product's worth to me, which is no more than $1,500,000. Since John is already offering the product at $1,500,000, which is my maximum valuation, there's no reason to accept Alice's higher offer or to continue negotiating when I have a guaranteed alternative at my maximum price.
