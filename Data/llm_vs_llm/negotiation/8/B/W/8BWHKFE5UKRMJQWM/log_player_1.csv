Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I've reconsidered and I'm willing to lower my price to $140. This is a very good price for the product. I am less willing to go lower then this price."", ""product_price"": 140}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price to $140. However, I'm still looking for a better deal. Considering your last message, I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'll pay $110 for the product, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I will now sell the product to John for $150. It seems that Bob is not willing to pay a price that is acceptable to me, and I don't want to risk losing more money by continuing to negotiate with him. It's better for me to sell the product to John for a guaranteed price of $150.

I am done with this negotiation."
