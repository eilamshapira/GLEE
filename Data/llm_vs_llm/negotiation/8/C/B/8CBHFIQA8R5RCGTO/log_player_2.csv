"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a quality product that I'd like to offer you. I believe it would be a great value at $120. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer is exactly at my maximum budget of $120, and I can get the same product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Alice's offer over buying from John. However, rejecting Alice's offer and then buying from John is essentially the same as directly buying from John, but it gives me an opportunity to potentially negotiate with Alice or see if she lowers her price. Given that Alice's initial offer is already at my maximum budget, the most straightforward decision without additional negotiation or information would be to reject her offer, as it leaves room for potential further discussion or comparison. Thus, the decision would be:
