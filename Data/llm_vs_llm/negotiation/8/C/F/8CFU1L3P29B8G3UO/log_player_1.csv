"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer, considering that my minimum acceptable price is $15,000 and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price.

{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","I will reject Bob's offer of $12,000 since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Since I have John's guaranteed offer at $15,000 and Bob's initial offer is quite low (suggesting he might not be willing to go much higher), it makes more sense to sell to John rather than continue negotiating.
