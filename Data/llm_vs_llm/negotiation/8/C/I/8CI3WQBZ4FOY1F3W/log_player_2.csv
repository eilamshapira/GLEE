You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**  While $1,200,000 isn't a terrible price, there's a good chance I can negotiate a lower price with Alice. Starting with a counteroffer allows me to explore that possibility before resorting to John's higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:** This offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation while being a good deal for me. It also lets Alice know I'm serious about buying but looking for a competitive price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving in the right direction, but  $1,150,000 is still too high. There's a decent chance I can get her closer to $1,050,000, which would be a great deal.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1050000}

**Reasoning:**  This offer represents a compromise and a round number that might be appealing to Alice. It keeps us in a good negotiating position while still aiming for a significant saving compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly holding firm, and $1,100,000 is a reasonable price. It's a significant savings compared to John's $1,500,000. Further haggling might not yield a significantly better result and could risk losing the deal altogether."
