"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. If you're interested in a quick sale, let me know. ",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit high, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'll meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I'm glad we're getting closer, but I still need to get a bit more for the product. I'll make a small concession, but I hope you can understand that I have other options, such as selling to another buyer for $100. I'm willing to sell it to you for $105, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your concession, $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $98. This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on this product and the fact that I could buy it from John for $80. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I have to consider my other options. As you know, I have another buyer willing to pay $100 for the product. I'm willing to give you a chance to buy it, but I need to get at least that much. I'll meet you at $100, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable selling at. If you're interested, let's close the deal.",100.0,Alice,7,
