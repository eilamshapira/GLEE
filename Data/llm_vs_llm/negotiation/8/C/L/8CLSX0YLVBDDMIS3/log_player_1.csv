Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. If you're interested in a quick sale, let me know.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $80 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to try to meet Bob somewhere in the middle."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit high, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'll meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $95 because it's still slightly below my minimum acceptable price, and I have another option to sell to John for $100. However, I'm interested in seeing if Bob is willing to go higher, so I'll proceed to the next round and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I'm glad we're getting closer, but I still need to get a bit more for the product. I'll make a small concession, but I hope you can understand that I have other options, such as selling to another buyer for $100. I'm willing to sell it to you for $105, which is a significant discount from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your concession, $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $98. This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on this product and the fact that I could buy it from John for $80. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $98 because it's still below the price I can get from John, which is $100. Since I have a guaranteed sale at $100, I don't see a reason to accept a lower offer from Bob. However, I'm willing to give Bob one last chance to meet or exceed the price I can get from John, so I'll proceed to the next round and make another counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I have to consider my other options. As you know, I have another buyer willing to pay $100 for the product. I'm willing to give you a chance to buy it, but I need to get at least that much. I'll meet you at $100, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable selling at. If you're interested, let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 100}"
