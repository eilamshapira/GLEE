"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob and $1,500,000 to me, I'll start with a high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum value.

{""product_price"": 1,800,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","I will reject Bob's offer of $1,000,000 since it's well below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. Since I can guarantee $1,500,000 from John and Bob's initial offer is so low (suggesting he might not be willing to meet my minimum price), I'll take the sure deal.
