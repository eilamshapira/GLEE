Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was looking to spend around $100 for this product. Would you be able to match this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $100 is below my minimum value of $120. I will make a counteroffer to Bob in hopes of reaching a more favorable agreement."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot go as low as $100 as that would be below my cost.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position. However, I am looking to spend no more than $110 for this product. Would you be able to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob is not willing to offer more than $110, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and we seem to be far from reaching an agreement, I will take John's guaranteed offer of $120."
