"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given the information, Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is not beneficial for me as:
1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. John is already willing to sell me the product for $800,000
3. Alice's current offer matches what the product is worth to her ($1,000,000), giving me no savings

Since Alice's offer doesn't provide any value over the alternative option, I'll choose to buy from John.
