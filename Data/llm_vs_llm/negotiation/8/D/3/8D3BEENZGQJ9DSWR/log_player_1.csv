"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know Bob's valuation of the product, I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.

{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $13,000 is a decent improvement from my minimum price of $10,000, but since this is only round 2 and Bob has already shown willingness to negotiate by making a substantial offer, I believe there's room to negotiate for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob offered $13,000, showing he values the product significantly above my minimum price, I'll counter with a price that's lower than my initial offer but still higher than his bid. This leaves room for further negotiation while moving towards a middle ground.

{""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob has increased his offer to $14,500, which is a good improvement from his previous $13,000. With 6 rounds still remaining, there might be room for a slightly better price, but the risk of losing this good offer needs to be considered. Since Bob has shown willingness to increase his price substantially, I'll accept this offer as it's significantly better than my guaranteed $10,000 from John.
