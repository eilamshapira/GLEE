"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable opportunity to acquire this product. Given its immense value to you, I'm initially pricing it at $14000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering its worth to both of us.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I understand that the product has immense value, but I was thinking more along the lines of a price that reflects a mutual benefit for both of us. Considering my budget and the product's worth to me, I'd like to propose a counteroffer.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate you engaging in the negotiation. However, $10000 is a bit lower than I can accept at this stage. How about we meet in the middle and settle at $13000? I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet in the middle. However, $13000 is still a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in finding a mutually beneficial price. Considering the product's value to you is $8000, I'd like to propose a counteroffer that splits the difference between my previous offer and your current one, but also takes into account the product's value to you. How about we settle at $11500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your thoughtful offer. However, I still believe the product's value justifies a slightly higher price. Let's try to find common ground. How about $12500?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for continuing to negotiate with me. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, $12500 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current one. How about we settle at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,6,
