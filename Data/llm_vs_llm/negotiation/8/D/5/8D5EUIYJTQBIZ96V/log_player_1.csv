Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I understand that the product has immense value, but I was thinking more along the lines of a price that reflects a mutual benefit for both of us. Considering my budget and the product's worth to me, I'd like to propose a counteroffer.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate you engaging in the negotiation.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm interested in finding a mutually beneficial price. Considering the product's value to you is $8000, I'd like to propose a counteroffer that splits the difference between my previous offer and your current one, but also takes into account the product's value to you.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for continuing to negotiate with me. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price.
