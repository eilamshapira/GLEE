"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think $2000000 is too high. I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700000 is far below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This is a significant compromise, and it reflects my confidence in this product's potential.  Let's find a middle ground.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for coming down, but I still think we're not quite there yet. I'm willing to raise my offer to $850000. Let's keep working towards that middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850000 is closer, it's still significantly below the value I've placed on this product. I'm prepared to meet you halfway at $1275000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's reach a conclusion.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
