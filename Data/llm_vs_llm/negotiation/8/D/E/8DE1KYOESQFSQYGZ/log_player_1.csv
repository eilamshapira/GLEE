{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I think you'll really like it! How about I offer it to you for $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit high. How about I offer you $80 instead? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Given Bob's counteroffer of $80, I'll carefully consider my options. My minimum acceptable price is $80.

I could accept his offer and make $0 profit ($80 - $80 = $0). I could sell to John and make the same amount of profit. I will see if I can get Bob to offer me more.

Therefore, I will:
