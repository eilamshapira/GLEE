"Alice's offer: The product price will be $300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $150 to me
2. John is willing to sell the product for $150
3. Alice's offer is $300, which is twice my maximum valuation

Alice's offer of $300 is significantly higher than both my valuation and John's price. There's no reason to accept this offer when I can get the same product for half the price from John.
