"Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $17,000 is way above my maximum value of $12,000, and it's also higher than John's fixed price of $12,000. It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice, knowing I always have John's $12,000 offer as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 11000}

I'll offer $11,000, which is below my maximum value of $12,000 and below John's price. This gives some room for negotiation while still being potentially profitable for Alice (since it's still above her cost of $10,000). If Alice rejects this, I can always go back to John's offer of $12,000, but it's worth trying to get a better deal first."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's new offer of $16,000 is still well above my maximum value of $12,000. While she did lower the price from her initial offer of $17,000, the reduction isn't significant enough to make it worthwhile. Since John is offering the product at $12,000 (which is equal to my maximum value), and Alice doesn't seem willing to come down to a reasonable price, it's best to take John's offer rather than continue negotiating. This way, I can secure the product at my maximum acceptable price rather than risk further unsuccessful negotiations with Alice."
