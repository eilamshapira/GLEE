"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price of $15000. It's a great value given its quality and market trends. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $15,000, but I know the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me. John is already willing to sell me the same product for $12,000.

In this case, Alice's offer exceeds the maximum value I place on the product, and it's also higher than my alternative option with John. There's no reason to accept this offer or continue negotiating when I have a guaranteed better option.
