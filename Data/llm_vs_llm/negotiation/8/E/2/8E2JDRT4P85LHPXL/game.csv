Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you the product for $140. I believe it's a great deal for both of us.,140.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While $140 is below my maximum budget, I think we can find a price that works better for both of us. Given the product's value, I'd like to counter with $125. This still gives you a profit margin while helping me save a bit more. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $132? I think that would work well for both of us.",132.0,Alice,3,
