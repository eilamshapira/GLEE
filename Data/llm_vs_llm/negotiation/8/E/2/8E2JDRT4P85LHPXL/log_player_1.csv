Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While $140 is below my maximum budget, I think we can find a price that works better for both of us. Given the product's value, I'd like to counter with $125. This still gives you a profit margin while helping me save a bit more. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
