"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you the product for $140. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's offer of $140 against the information I have.

The product is worth no more than $150 to me, and I know it costs Alice $120. I also have the option to buy from John for $150 as a backup.

Alice's offer of $140 is below my maximum value ($150), but I could potentially negotiate a better deal since there's a $20 margin between her cost ($120) and her offer ($140).

It would be better to try negotiating before accepting, especially since I have John's offer as a safety net.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While $140 is below my maximum budget, I think we can find a price that works better for both of us. Given the product's value, I'd like to counter with $125. This still gives you a profit margin while helping me save a bit more. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $132? I think that would work well for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has countered with $132, which is a significant improvement from her initial $140 offer. She's moving in the right direction and has already come down $8 from her initial price.

Let's evaluate this offer:
- Alice's cost: $120
- Her current offer: $132
- My maximum value: $150
- John's backup offer: $150

The $132 price is $18 less than my maximum value and John's offer. Alice has moved about halfway from her initial offer toward my counteroffer. This is a reasonable compromise that gives us both some value - she makes $12 over her cost, and I save $18 compared to buying from John.

At this point, I think this is a fair deal and further negotiation might risk losing the deal over a relatively small amount.
