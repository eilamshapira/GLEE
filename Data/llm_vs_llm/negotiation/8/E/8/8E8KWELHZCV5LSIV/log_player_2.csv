"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. It's a valuable piece, and I believe it could be incredibly beneficial to you. I'm asking $12000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is $2,000 more than John's price ($10,000), and also exceeds my maximum value for the product ($10,000), the rational decision would be to buy from John.
