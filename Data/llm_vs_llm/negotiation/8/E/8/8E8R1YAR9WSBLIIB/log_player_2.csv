"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am offering you the product for $2000000. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is more than double the $800,000 that I value the product at. Since John is willing to sell me the same product for $800,000, which matches my maximum valuation, I should purchase from John instead.
