"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is below my minimum acceptable price. I need to get at least $80 for this item, and I actually have another buyer (John) willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to sell it to you if we can agree on a fair price. How about $125? This is significantly lower than my initial offer and represents excellent value for this product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for the new proposal. I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I'm still not comfortable paying $125. Given that you mentioned $80 as your minimum acceptable price, I'd like to meet you halfway between that and my initial offer. How about we settle on $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
