Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is below my minimum acceptable price. I need to get at least $80 for this item, and I actually have another buyer (John) willing to pay that amount. However, I'd prefer to sell it to you if we can agree on a fair price. How about $125? This is significantly lower than my initial offer and represents excellent value for this product."", ""product_price"": 125}"
