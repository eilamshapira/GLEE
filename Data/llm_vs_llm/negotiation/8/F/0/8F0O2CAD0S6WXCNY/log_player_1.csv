"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This gives us room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can still get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show good faith, but I'm still holding firm at a price that's fair for both of us. This gives Bob a better chance of accepting, while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still not high enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also aware that John is a safe backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm going to lower my offer again to $1,400,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price. This should give Bob an incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  With a few rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. I'm going to accept this offer."
