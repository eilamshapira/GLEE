"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given the information:
- The product is worth at most $8,000 to me (Bob)
- Alice's offer is $10,000
- I can buy the same product from John for $8,000

Alice's offer of $10,000 exceeds both my maximum valuation and the alternative option from John. There's no reason to accept this offer or continue negotiating when I have a guaranteed better option.
