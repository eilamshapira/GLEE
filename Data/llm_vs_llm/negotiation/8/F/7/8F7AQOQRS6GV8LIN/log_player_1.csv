(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer of $9,000 is higher than John's $8,000, but there's still room for negotiation since I know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

While there might still be room for negotiation, considering we're already in round 4 out of 10, and this is a decent offer well above my minimum acceptable price ($8,000), I'll accept this offer.
