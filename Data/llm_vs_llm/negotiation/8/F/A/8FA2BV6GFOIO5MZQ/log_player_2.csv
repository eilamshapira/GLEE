"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully:

- Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000
- The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me
- John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000

Alice's price is actually higher than what the product is worth to me, and it's also higher than John's alternative offer. There's no reason to accept this offer or even make a counteroffer when I can get the product at a better price elsewhere.
