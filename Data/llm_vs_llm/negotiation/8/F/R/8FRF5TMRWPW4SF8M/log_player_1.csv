"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer is exactly the same as my minimum acceptable price and equal to John's offer, there's no advantage in accepting Bob's offer over selling to John. However, I believe I can get a better price from Bob through negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price somewhat from my initial offer but still maintain a good margin above my minimum value.
