Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a price that's closer to Bob's valuation of $120, but leaves some room for negotiation if needed.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $105 is better than John's fixed price of $100, but still quite low compared to Bob's valuation of $120, I'll reject it and make another counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price slightly from my initial offer but still maintain a good margin, considering Bob values the product at $120.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer of $108 is a reasonable improvement from his previous offer of $105. While it's not as high as I'd like, continuing the negotiation risks Bob walking away or becoming frustrated. The offer is notably better than John's $100, so I'll accept it.
