"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $2,000,000, this is well above my maximum value of $800,000. The product is not worth $2,000,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $800,000. Since Alice's initial offer is so high, I should reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice opened with a very high price of $2,000,000, I need to make a reasonable counteroffer that gives us room to negotiate while still being potentially attractive. I know the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and that's my BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement) since I can buy from John at that price. I'll start with a much lower offer to anchor the negotiation.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has only reduced her price by $200,000, from $2,000,000 to $1,800,000. This is still significantly above my maximum value of $800,000. Since I can buy the product from John for $800,000, there's no reason for me to accept an offer that's more than double that price. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has only marginally decreased her price from $2,000,000 to $1,800,000, which indicates she might be expecting a significant increase from my previous offer. However, I need to be clear that my maximum value is $800,000 since I can buy from John at that price. I'll increase my offer somewhat to show good faith in the negotiation while still keeping well below my maximum.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has reduced her price to $1,600,000, which shows some movement but is still double my alternative option of buying from John for $800,000. The product is only worth up to $800,000 to me, so paying $1,600,000 would be a significant loss. Since we've gone through several rounds and Alice's offers are still far above my maximum, I'll reject this offer again.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice is slowly moving down in price but still remains far above my maximum value. I need to make it clear that I have a firm alternative at $800,000 while still showing willingness to negotiate. I'll increase my offer again but make sure to stay below my maximum value.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still significantly higher than my maximum value of $800,000. She has reduced her price by $200,000 in each round, but we're still far from reaching an acceptable price. Since I can buy the same product from John for $800,000, I have no reason to accept this offer. I'll reject it and make another counteroffer.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice is continuing to decrease her price but at a pace that won't reach my maximum value within our remaining rounds. I need to be more direct about my constraints while still showing I'm willing to pay a premium to buy from her rather than John. I'll make a substantial increase in my offer to show good faith.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly above my maximum value of $800,000. We've had multiple rounds of negotiation, and we're still far apart. With only one round remaining after this, and Alice's pace of reduction being $100,000-$200,000 per round, we're unlikely to reach an acceptable price. Since I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $800,000, which is my maximum value for this product, it's time to exercise that option.
