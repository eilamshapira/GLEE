Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $1500000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I reject Bob's offer of $1,200,000 because I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better price. Since Bob's maximum value for the product is $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation. I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. 

My counteroffer: $1,400,000. This price is closer to Bob's maximum value and reflects the product's worth. I'm hoping Bob will consider this offer more seriously and we can reach an agreement."
