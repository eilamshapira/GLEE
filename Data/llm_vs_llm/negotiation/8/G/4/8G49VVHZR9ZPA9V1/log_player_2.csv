"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects its worth. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget.  There's no immediate benefit to accepting.  By rejecting the offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  If that fails, you can still purchase from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $1200000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad we can continue negotiating. After considering your offer, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my initial price. I believe $1400000 is a more reasonable price, taking into account the product's value and your expressed interest.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high.  While it's a slight decrease from her initial offer, it's still above my target price. I want to see if I can push for a lower price.  I can still buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail."
