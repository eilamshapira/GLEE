"Alice, thank you for the offer, but that's a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Given the market value, I'm prepared to offer $900000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't accept $900000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I understand your budget constraints, but I should mention that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1500000 for this product. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Could you consider a price of $1500000? This matches my alternative offer and represents the minimum value I can accept for this product.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
