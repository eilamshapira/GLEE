Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't accept $900,000 as it's significantly below the product's value. I understand your budget constraints, but I should mention that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,500,000 for this product. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Could you consider a price of $1,500,000? This matches my alternative offer and represents the minimum value I can accept for this product."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
