"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $11,999 is very close to my maximum budget of $12,000 and is actually $1 less, it's a good deal for me. Buying from John for $12,000 would leave me with no remaining budget, whereas accepting Alice's offer allows me to stay within my budget and have $1 left over.
