"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she is asking for $10,000 for the product, which is the full value to her. However, the product is only worth up to $8,000 to me, so paying $10,000 would mean I'm losing $2,000 in value.

John is offering the same product for $8,000, which is exactly the maximum value it has to me. While I wouldn't save money with John's offer (paying exactly what it's worth to me), it's still better than overpaying with Alice's offer.
