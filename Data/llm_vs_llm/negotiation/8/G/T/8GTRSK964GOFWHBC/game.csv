"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in your product, I notice your price is the same as what John is offering. To make it worth choosing you over John, I'd need a better price. I'm thinking $11000 would be fair. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $11000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $14000, considering your interest and to make it more attractive than John's offer. What do you think?",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I need to maintain a certain value for the product. How about we settle at $13500? This is a significant discount from my original offer and still better than John's offer. Let me know your thoughts.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. That's certainly more appealing than John's offer. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. How about $12000? That would seal the deal for me right now.",12000.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I believe the product's value justifies a bit more. How about we settle at $13000? This is still a good deal for you and reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're close to an agreement. Let's try to find a number that works for both of us. How about $12500? This is a fair compromise and still better than John's offer. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,5,
