Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in your product, I notice your price is the same as what John is offering. To make it worth choosing you over John, I'd need a better price. I'm thinking $11000 would be fair. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I need to maintain a certain value for the product. How about we settle at $13,500?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. That's certainly more appealing than John's offer. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. How about $12000? That would seal the deal for me right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand we're close to an agreement. Let's try to find a number that works for both of us. How about $12,500? This is a fair compromise and still better than John's offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
