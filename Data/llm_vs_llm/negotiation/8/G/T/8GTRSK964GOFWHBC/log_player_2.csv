"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to decide if I should accept Alice's offer, make a counteroffer, or buy from John.

Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is exactly the maximum value I'm willing to pay and also the same price John is offering. Since there's no price advantage in either option right now, I should try to negotiate with Alice to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in your product, I notice your price is the same as what John is offering. To make it worth choosing you over John, I'd need a better price. I'm thinking $11,000 would be fair. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I need to maintain a certain value for the product. How about we settle at $13500? This is a significant discount from my original offer and still better than John's offer. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down from $15,000 to $13,500, which is a good improvement and already $1,500 less than John's price. However, since we're only in round 3 of 10 possible rounds, I can try to negotiate further to get an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. That's certainly more appealing than John's offer. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. How about $12,000? That would seal the deal for me right now."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand we're close to an agreement. Let's try to find a number that works for both of us. How about $12500? This is a fair compromise and still better than John's offer. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down to $12,500, which is a good price and $2,500 less than John's offer. We're making good progress in the negotiation, and she's shown willingness to compromise. While I could try to negotiate further, this is already a substantial discount, and there's always the risk of pushing too hard.
