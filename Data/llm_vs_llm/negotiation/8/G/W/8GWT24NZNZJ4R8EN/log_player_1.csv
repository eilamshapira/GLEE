"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","$60 is far too low, as it's less than half of my minimum acceptable price of $150. Since I have John's guaranteed offer of $150, I would never accept anything lower than that. Bob's offer being so low suggests he might not be a serious buyer, but I'll give him another chance with a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial price but still maintain a strong position, showing some flexibility while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 220}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's new offer of $70 is only slightly higher than his previous offer of $60, and still well below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Given that we're now in round 4 and Bob has only increased his offer by $10, showing little movement toward a reasonable price, and I have a guaranteed $150 from John, I'll end the negotiation and take John's offer.
