"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($10,000) but lower than what I initially offered ($14,000), and considering Bob's true value for the product is $15,000, I believe there's room for negotiation to get closer to my initial offer or at least ensure I get a good deal.

Given that selling to John for $10,000 is the least desirable option at this point, and accepting $12,000, while better, doesn't maximize my potential earnings, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be slightly lower than my initial offer to show willingness to negotiate but still aims to capitalize on Bob's higher valuation of the product.

Counteroffer: $13,500

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed with a counteroffer of $13,500.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's new offer of $12,750 is closer to my previous counteroffer of $13,500, indicating that he's willing to negotiate further and pay a premium for the product. Given that his valuation of the product is $15,000, I believe he has more room to increase his offer.

However, I also need to consider that the negotiation could continue indefinitely, and at some point, it might be more beneficial to accept a slightly lower offer than risk losing the sale altogether.

Since Bob's offer of $12,750 is still below my desired price but significantly higher than the $10,000 I could get from John, I'll make another counteroffer. This time, I'll reduce the price slightly from my previous offer to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to meet me closer to the middle.

Counteroffer: $13,250

So, my decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed with a counteroffer of $13,250.
