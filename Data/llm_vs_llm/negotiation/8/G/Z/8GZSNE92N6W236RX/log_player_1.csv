"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, considering my minimum value is $120 and Bob's offer is only $100, I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""How about we meet in the middle? I could offer it to you for $160."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's closer, Alice, but still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","This is a tough call. $130 is more than my minimum, and the negotiation is going back and forth. I could try to get a little more, but I might lose the sale altogether. Selling to John for $120 is always an option.

Given the current offer, I'll take the sure thing and accept Bob's offer.
