"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know I can get it from another seller for $100, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you be willing to sell it for $80? That would make it worth my while to buy from you instead of the other seller.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal. I can come down to $130. I can sell the product to you for $130? Would you accept my counteroffer?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down in price, Alice, but $130 is still more than I can justify paying, especially since I can get the exact same product from John for $100. I'm happy to buy from you instead, but I can only offer $85. This gives you the sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option.",85.0,Bob,4,
