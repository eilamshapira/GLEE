Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know I can get it from another seller for $100, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you be willing to sell it for $80? That would make it worth my while to buy from you instead of the other seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

I'm happy to buy from you instead, but I can only offer $85. This gives you the sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option.
