"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $150. It's a great value and I think you'll be very satisfied with it. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is asking for $150, but the product is only worth up to $100 to me. Since John is willing to sell me the same product for $100, which matches my maximum valuation, there's no reason to pay Alice's higher price of $150.

Let me reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations don't go well, I can always fall back on John's offer.

I know I can get it from another seller for $100, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you be willing to sell it for $80?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has come down to $130, which is better than her initial offer of $150, but it's still more than what I value the product at (no more than $100) and more than John's price ($100). There's no reason for me to accept this offer when I can get the same product for less.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down in price, Alice, but $130 is still more than I can justify paying, especially since I can get the exact same product from John for $100. I'm happy to buy from you instead, but I can only offer $85. This gives you the sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 85}"
