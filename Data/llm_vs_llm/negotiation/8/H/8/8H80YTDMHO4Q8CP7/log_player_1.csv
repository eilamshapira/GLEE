Send your offer to Bob.,"Based on the information provided, I need to make an offer to Bob that maximizes my profit while ensuring it's attractive enough for him to accept.

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he would gain value from any price below that amount. For me, the product is worth at least $1,000,000, and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at exactly $1,000,000.

Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, I can potentially charge up to that amount, but pricing too close to his maximum valuation increases the risk of rejection. I want to offer a price that gives Bob some incentive to accept while maximizing my profit above my $1,000,000 baseline.

A reasonable approach would be to set a price that gives Bob some of the surplus value while keeping most of it for myself:

{""product_price"": 1,150,000}

This price gives Bob a $50,000 surplus ($1,200,000 - $1,150,000) while giving me $150,000 more than my alternative option with John."
