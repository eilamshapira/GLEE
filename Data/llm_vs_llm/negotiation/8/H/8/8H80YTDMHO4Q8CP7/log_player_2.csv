"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $1,150,000, reject it, or buy from John for $1,200,000.

The product is worth up to $1,200,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $1,150,000, which is $50,000 less than my maximum valuation. If I reject Alice's offer, my only other option is to buy from John at $1,200,000, which would cost me $50,000 more.

Since Alice's offer is below my maximum valuation and better than John's price, I should accept Alice's offer.
