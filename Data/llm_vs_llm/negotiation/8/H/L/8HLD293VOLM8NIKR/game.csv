"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. After considering my budget, I'm willing to offer $12000 for the product. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $12000 is a bit lower than I was expecting. I'm willing to consider a serious buyer like yourself, so I'll make a counteroffer. I can offer the product to you for $18000, which is a more reasonable price considering its value.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the generous counteroffer, Alice. While I do see value in the product, my budget is limited. I can stretch to $13500. I hope we can agree on this price.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget to $13500. However, I still believe the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I can offer the product to you for $16000, which I think is a fair price considering its value.",16000.0,Alice,5,
