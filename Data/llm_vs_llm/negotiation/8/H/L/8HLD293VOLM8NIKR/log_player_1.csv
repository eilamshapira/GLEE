Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. After considering my budget, I'm willing to offer $12000 for the product. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is lower than the minimum value of $15,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $15,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I am willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $12,000 is a bit lower than I was expecting.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the generous counteroffer, Alice. While I do see value in the product, my budget is limited. I can stretch to $13500. I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $13,500 is still lower than the price I was hoping for, but closer to my minimum acceptable value, I will consider it. However, I also have the option to sell the product to John for $15,000, which is higher than Bob's offer. Given that I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, I will reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price from him.
