"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, Iâ€™m offering you this exclusive product for $200. If you're interested and see value in this, please let me know; otherwise, I might have to move on to another buyer at $100. Looking forward to hearing from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is asking for $200, which is more than the $100 the product is worth to me. Meanwhile, John is willing to sell me the identical product for $100, which matches my maximum valuation.

There's no reason for me to pay Alice $200 when I can get the same product from John for $100. Even if I were to make a counteroffer to Alice, I couldn't reasonably expect her to go below $100 (which she mentioned is her alternative buyer's price).

The rational decision is to buy from John rather than accepting Alice's overpriced offer or prolonging negotiations.
