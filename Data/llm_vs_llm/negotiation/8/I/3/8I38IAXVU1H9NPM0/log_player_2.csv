"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this high-quality product for $120. If you're interested, let me know! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $120
2. John is selling the same product for $120
3. The product is worth $120 to me (Bob)

Since all prices are exactly the same ($120), and both Alice and John are offering the same product, there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other. In this case, since Alice has already made the effort to reach out and make the offer, it would be reasonable to accept her offer.
