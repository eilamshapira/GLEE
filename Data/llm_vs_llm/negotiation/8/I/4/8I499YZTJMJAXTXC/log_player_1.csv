Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this. Since Bob values the product at $80, and I can always sell it to John for $80, I should start with a higher price to maximize my potential profit.

{""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since I know I can sell the product to John for $80, and the product is worth at least $80 to me, I should definitely reject Bob's offer of $60 as it's too low. I also have no reason to accept any offer below $80 since I have John's guaranteed offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my initial offer of $95 but is interested in negotiating, I'll lower my price slightly but still keep it above my guaranteed $80 from John.

{""product_price"": 87}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $70 is still below the guaranteed $80 I can get from John, and the product is worth no less than $80 to me, there's no reason to accept this offer. At this point, since Bob seems unwilling to meet or exceed $80, it's best to take the guaranteed offer from John.
