Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, I'll start with an offer. Here's the initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Considering Bob's counteroffer, I need to decide if I can get a better price. $10,000 is more than my minimum, and I don't know Bob's true valuation. I will try to get a slightly higher price.
