"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to consider my options here. Alice is offering the product for $1,900,000, which is $900,000 more than the maximum value I place on the product ($1,000,000). This offer would cause me to lose money.

Meanwhile, John is offering to sell me the same product for $1,000,000, which is exactly the maximum value I place on the product.

Since Alice's offer is substantially higher than the product's worth to me, and also higher than John's offer, the rational decision is to buy from John.
