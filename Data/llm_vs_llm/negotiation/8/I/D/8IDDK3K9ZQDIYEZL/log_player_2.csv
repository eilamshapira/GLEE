"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

- The product is worth up to $120 to me (Bob)
- Alice is offering to sell it for $120
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $120

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price of $120, and the product is worth exactly $120 to me, I'm indifferent between the two sellers. However, since Alice made the offer first, and there's no advantage to buying from John, I'll accept Alice's offer.
