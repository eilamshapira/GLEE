"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, I must point out that your asking price of $2500000 is significantly above my budget. I'm actually looking at a comparable alternative from another seller for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $1100000 for the product, which I believe is fair considering market conditions. Looking forward to your response.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your thoughtful counteroffer. I understand your concerns regarding the price, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. Given the exceptional quality and value of this product, I'm prepared to lower my price to $1400000, which I believe strikes a fair balance between our positions. Let me know if this works for you, or if you'd like to discuss further.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
