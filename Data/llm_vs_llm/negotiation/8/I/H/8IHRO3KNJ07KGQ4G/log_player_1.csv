Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, I must point out that your asking price of $2500000 is significantly above my budget. I'm actually looking at a comparable alternative from another seller for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $1100000 for the product, which I believe is fair considering market conditions. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
