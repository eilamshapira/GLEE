"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $180. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate that it's a high-quality product, $180 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I can offer you $90 for the product. This is a fair price considering I can get a similar product elsewhere for $120. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, after considering your perspective, I'm willing to lower my price to $150. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. I hope we can meet halfway.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate you moving in my direction, but $150 is still more than I can justify spending on this product. I should be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $120. I'd like to buy from you, so I can offer $100. This gives you a better deal than walking away with no sale, while giving me some savings compared to my other option.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've reconsidered my previous offer and I'm willing to lower the price to $130. This is very close to the price you mentioned from the other seller, and I believe my product offers more value. I hope we can close the deal at this price.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130, which is much closer to what I can pay. I'm definitely interested in making a deal with you rather than going to the other seller. However, since I can get the same product for $120 elsewhere, I can offer you $110. This gives you a sale at $110 instead of me walking away to buy from the other seller, and saves me $10 compared to my alternative. This seems like a fair compromise where we both benefit.",110.0,Bob,6,
