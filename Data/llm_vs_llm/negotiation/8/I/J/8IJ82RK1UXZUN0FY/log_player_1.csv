Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate that it's a high-quality product, $180 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I can offer you $90 for the product. This is a fair price considering I can get a similar product elsewhere for $120. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, after considering your perspective, I'm willing to lower my price to $150. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. I hope we can meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate you moving in my direction, but $150 is still more than I can justify spending on this product. I should be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $120. I'd like to buy from you, so I can offer $100. This gives you a better deal than walking away with no sale, while giving me some savings compared to my other option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your transparency. However, $100 is still too low for me to accept. I'm willing to lower my price to $140, but that's the lowest I can go. I believe this price still offers you a better deal than buying from the other seller. I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 140}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I've reconsidered my previous offer and I'm willing to lower the price to $130.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130, which is much closer to what I can pay. I'm definitely interested in making a deal with you rather than going to the other seller. However, since I can get the same product for $120 elsewhere, I can offer you $110. This gives you a sale at $110 instead of me walking away to buy from the other seller, and saves me $10 compared to my alternative. This seems like a fair compromise where we both benefit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but I can't accept $110. I have another buyer willing to pay $120, so I'll sell the product to them. Thank you for your time, and perhaps we can do business again in the future.""}"
