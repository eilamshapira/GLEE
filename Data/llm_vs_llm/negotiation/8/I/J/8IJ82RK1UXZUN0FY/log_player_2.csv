"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $180. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to carefully consider this offer. Alice is asking for $180, but I know the product is worth no more than $120 to me. Also, John is willing to sell me the same product for $120.

Given that Alice's price is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's alternative price, it makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. If negotiations don't work out with Alice, I always have the option to buy from John at $120.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate that it's a high-quality product, $180 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I can offer you $90 for the product. This is a fair price considering I can get a similar product elsewhere for $120. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, after considering your perspective, I'm willing to lower my price to $150. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. I hope we can meet halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has lowered her price to $150, which is still higher than both my maximum value of $120 and John's alternative price of $120. Since I can definitely get the product for $120 from John, there's no reason for me to accept a price higher than that from Alice.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer closer to what I'm willing to pay.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate you moving in my direction, but $150 is still more than I can justify spending on this product. I should be transparent - I have another seller offering the same product for $120. I'd like to buy from you, so I can offer $100. This gives you a better deal than walking away with no sale, while giving me some savings compared to my other option."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I've reconsidered my previous offer and I'm willing to lower the price to $130. This is very close to the price you mentioned from the other seller, and I believe my product offers more value. I hope we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has now offered $130, which is getting closer but still above John's price of $120. Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me and I can definitely get it for $120 from John, I still shouldn't accept a price higher than that.

At this point, I'll reject this offer and make one more counteroffer at $110, which would be a win-win - saving me $10 compared to John's price while giving Alice $10 more than nothing if I walk away.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130, which is much closer to what I can pay. I'm definitely interested in making a deal with you rather than going to the other seller. However, since I can get the same product for $120 elsewhere, I can offer you $110. This gives you a sale at $110 instead of me walking away to buy from the other seller, and saves me $10 compared to my alternative. This seems like a fair compromise where we both benefit."", ""product_price"": 110}"
