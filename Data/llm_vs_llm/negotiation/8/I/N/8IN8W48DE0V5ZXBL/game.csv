"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $150. It's a great product and I think you'll find it very useful. Are you interested?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer but $150 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know I can get a similar product elsewhere for $100. However, I'd prefer to purchase from you if we can agree on a better price. I'm willing to offer $75 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in my product. However, $75 is too low for me. I'm willing to lower my price to $120. This is a fair price considering the quality of the product. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, $120 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I can purchase this product from another seller for $100, but I'd prefer to buy from you. To make it worth your while, I'm willing to offer $90. This is a fair price that gives you a sale and saves me a bit compared to my alternative option. What do you say?",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective. I appreciate your increased offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. This way, we both get a fair deal. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down to $105, Alice. We're getting closer to an agreement. However, I know I can purchase this product from John for exactly $100. If you can match that price, I'd be happy to buy from you instead. My offer is $100, which is the most I'm willing to pay as that's what I would pay elsewhere. Can we close the deal at this price?",100.0,Bob,6,
