"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $150. It's a great product and I think you'll find it very useful. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice is offering the product for $150, which is higher than its worth to me (no more than $100). It's also higher than John's price of $100. I can either immediately buy from John or try to negotiate with Alice to get a better price.

Given that I can buy from John for $100 at any time, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer of $150. I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer but $150 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know I can get a similar product elsewhere for $100. However, I'd prefer to purchase from you if we can agree on a better price. I'm willing to offer $75 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in my product. However, $75 is too low for me. I'm willing to lower my price to $120. This is a fair price considering the quality of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has lowered her price to $120, which is a good sign, but it's still above the $100 that John is offering. Since I can get the product from John for $100, there's no reason to accept an offer higher than that. I'll reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, $120 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I can purchase this product from another seller for $100, but I'd prefer to buy from you. To make it worth your while, I'm willing to offer $90. This is a fair price that gives you a sale and saves me a bit compared to my alternative option. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your perspective. I appreciate your increased offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. This way, we both get a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has come down to $105, which is much closer but still more than John's price of $100. Since I can get the same product from John for $100, and my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down to $105, Alice. We're getting closer to an agreement. However, I know I can purchase this product from John for exactly $100. If you can match that price, I'd be happy to buy from you instead. My offer is $100, which is the most I'm willing to pay as that's what I would pay elsewhere. Can we close the deal at this price?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
