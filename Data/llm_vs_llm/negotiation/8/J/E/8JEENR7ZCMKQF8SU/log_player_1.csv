Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, based on my initial assessment.  Let me know if that's a price we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer is at the minimum value I'm willing to accept, and I have the option to sell to John for the same price, I'll consider my next move carefully. However, I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate, and I believe the product is worth more to Bob than he's currently offering. Therefore, I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try and get a better price.

Let's discuss a price that reflects the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
