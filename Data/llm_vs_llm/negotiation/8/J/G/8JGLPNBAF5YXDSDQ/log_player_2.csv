"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know I can get the product for $150 from John, and that's my maximum value for the product, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice that's below that price.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer ($160) is still higher than John's price ($150), and I know I can always fall back to John's offer, I'll reject and try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 130}

Since my previous offer of $120 was rejected and Alice came down to $160, I'll increase my offer to $130. This is still well below John's price of $150, giving me room to save money while also showing some movement toward meeting Alice's price."
