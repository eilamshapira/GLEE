Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
``` 

This offer gives Bob a good deal, as it's significantly lower than the product's value to him.  It also leaves room for negotiation if he counters. I'm aiming to get a price closer to the product's worth to me, but still leave a healthy profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a good deal, it's still below my desired price point. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This offer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It allows for further negotiation but brings the price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to accept it to secure the deal."
