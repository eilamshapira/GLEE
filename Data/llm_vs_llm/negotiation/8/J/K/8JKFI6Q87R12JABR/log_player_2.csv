"Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I notice that Alice's offer of $17,500 is higher than both my maximum valuation ($15,000) and the alternative option of buying from John for $15,000. This offer doesn't make financial sense for me to accept.

Since I can buy the product from John for $15,000, which matches my maximum valuation, there's no reason to pay Alice $17,500. I could make a counteroffer to Alice, but since I already have a guaranteed option at $15,000, I should just take that option.
