"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $25000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $10000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand budget constraints. However, $10000 is lower than what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $20000.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. $20000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $12500? This is a fair middle ground, considering my budget constraints.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle. However, the intrinsic value and potential for future appreciation makes it difficult for me to go that low. My absolute lowest is $17500. This is a final offer, and I believe it represents a significant value for you.",17500.0,Alice,5,
