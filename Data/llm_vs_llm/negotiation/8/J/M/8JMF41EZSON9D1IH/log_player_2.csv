"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $1,000,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John at $1,200,000

The product is worth up to $1,200,000 to me. Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is $200,000 less than what John is offering. Since the goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, I should accept Alice's offer as it provides the best value.
