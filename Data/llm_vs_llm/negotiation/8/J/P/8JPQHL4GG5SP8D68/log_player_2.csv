"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $1,200,000. It's also higher than John's guaranteed price of $1,200,000. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to negotiate a better price with Alice. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000}

I'll start with a counteroffer of $800,000, which is significantly below John's price of $1,200,000. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing me to get a better deal than John's offer. If Alice's next counteroffer is still too high, we can try to meet somewhere in the middle, as long as it stays below $1,200,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $1,700,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's guaranteed price ($1,200,000). While Alice has reduced the price from her initial offer, it's still not competitive. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. If Alice doesn't become more reasonable with her pricing, I can always take John's offer later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm increasing my offer to $950,000, which shows some movement toward meeting Alice partway while still staying well below John's price of $1,200,000. This gives Alice room to negotiate while potentially saving me money compared to John's offer. If Alice still doesn't come down to a reasonable price, I can continue negotiating or ultimately go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is still above both my maximum value and John's price of $1,200,000. While Alice is gradually reducing her price, she's still not offering a competitive deal. I'll reject and make another counteroffer. If Alice continues to stay above $1,200,000, I may need to consider taking John's offer soon, as we're already halfway through our negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm increasing my offer to $1,050,000, showing continued willingness to move toward a middle ground while still staying significantly below John's price of $1,200,000. This gives us both some room to negotiate while potentially saving me money compared to John's offer. We're more than halfway through our negotiation rounds, so I'm hoping Alice will recognize this as a serious offer and respond with a more competitive price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's latest offer ($1,300,000) is still above John's guaranteed price ($1,200,000)
2. We've gone through 7 rounds, and Alice's price reductions have been slow
3. There's no guarantee Alice will go below $1,200,000 in the remaining rounds
4. Even if she does eventually go lower, the difference might be minimal

It's better to secure John's guaranteed price of $1,200,000 now rather than risk continuing negotiations that might not result in a better deal."
