"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $1100000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend at this time.  I'm happy to pay $900000 for it.  This price is fair considering its value to me and still allows you a healthy profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that you find the previous price a bit high. I'm willing to lower my offer to $1000000.
