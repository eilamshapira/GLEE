Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $1100000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend at this time.  I'm happy to pay $900000 for it.  This price is fair considering its value to me and still allows you a healthy profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
