"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, the price is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Considering I can buy a similar product for $80, I'd like to offer you $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must say that $60 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's quality and value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $140, which is $10 less than my initial price. I believe it's a fair deal, and I'm open to further negotiations.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $70. That's my final offer.",70.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price to $70. However, I must reiterate that the product's value is much higher than that. Considering you said $70 is your final offer, I'm willing to make a significant compromise. I can offer it to you for $120, which is $20 less than my previous offer. If this price doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",120.0,Alice,5,
