"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its exceptional quality and value, I'm starting with a price of $150. I believe it's a fair price, but I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, the price is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Considering I can buy a similar product for $80, I'd like to offer you $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

My reasoning is that Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than my initial price and even lower than what John is willing to pay. I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob, so I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must say that $60 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's quality and value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $140, which is $10 less than my initial price. I believe it's a fair deal, and I'm open to further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $70. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

My reasoning is that Bob's offer of $70 is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept, and he claims it's his final offer, but I'm not convinced. Even if it is his final offer, I have a better option with John, who is willing to pay $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further or consider selling to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price to $70. However, I must reiterate that the product's value is much higher than that. Considering you said $70 is your final offer, I'm willing to make a significant compromise. I can offer it to you for $120, which is $20 less than my previous offer. If this price doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 120}"
