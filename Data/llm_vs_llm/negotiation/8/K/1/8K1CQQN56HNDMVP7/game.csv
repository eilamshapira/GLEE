"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12000 is quite high for me. I know this product is available elsewhere for $10000, but I'd like to work with you. Would you consider selling it for $8500? This would save me from having to go elsewhere and would give you a quick sale.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $8500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down from my original price though. How about we settle for $11000? This way, we both give a little and get a fair deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
