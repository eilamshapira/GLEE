Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12000 is quite high for me. I know this product is available elsewhere for $10000, but I'd like to work with you. Would you consider selling it for $8500? This would save me from having to go elsewhere and would give you a quick sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down from my original price though. How about we settle for $11,000? This way, we both give a little and get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
