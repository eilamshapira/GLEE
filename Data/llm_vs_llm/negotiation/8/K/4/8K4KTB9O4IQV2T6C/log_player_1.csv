"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a high offer to maximize my potential earnings. Considering the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, I'll start with an even higher price.

{""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $800,000 is lower than the minimum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for $1,000,000, I will reject Bob's offer. However, I won't sell it to John just yet, as I still have the potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $800,000, which is lower than my minimum acceptable price, I'll make a counteroffer that is still high but slightly lower than my initial offer to show that I'm willing to negotiate.

{""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $900,000 is still lower than the minimum value of $1,000,000 that the product is worth to me, but it's getting closer. Since I have the option to sell it to John for $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer, I'll reject Bob's offer again and consider making another counteroffer to see if I can get him to meet or exceed my minimum acceptable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $900,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous one, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm trying to meet Bob halfway and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.
