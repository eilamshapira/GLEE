Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $9,500, which is a fair price considering its quality and value."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product sounds interesting, but $9500 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob since $8,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) than my initial offer. There's still room for negotiation to get a better price than both Bob's current offer and John's standing offer.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, I need to get a bit more for this product. I can reduce my initial price to $9,000, which is quite reasonable given the product's value."", ""product_price"": 9000}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $9000 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $8700? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $8,700. This is a reasonable compromise as it's significantly better than John's standing offer of $8,000, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. The price is above my minimum threshold and represents a fair middle ground between our positions."
