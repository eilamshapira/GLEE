"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 (John's offer). Since the offer is so low, and there's a risk that we might not reach an acceptable price through further negotiation, I'll exercise my option to sell to John.
