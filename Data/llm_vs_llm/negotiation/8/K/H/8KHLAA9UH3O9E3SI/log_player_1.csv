"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm offering for sale. Given its value and features, I'm offering it to you for $180."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $70 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $70 is far too low, as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $70 is significantly below the product's value. I understand you have a budget, but I cannot go below $160 given the quality and worth of the product."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but $160 is still outside my budget.  I could go up to $85. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $150. Bob's offers are consistently well below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and he seems unwilling to approach a price that would work for me. Since John's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, it's best to conclude the negotiation and sell to him."
