Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you my product for $140. I believe this is a fair price given its value. Let me know what you think!,140.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your product, $140 is quite high for me. The market value for similar products is much lower. I'm willing to pay $90 for it, which would still give you a reasonable profit. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I appreciate your offer of $90, but I think we can meet somewhere in the middle. How about I sell the product to you for $120? It's a great deal for the value you'll receive!",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. However, $120 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I can go up to $100, which gives you a $20 profit on your $80 cost. That's a fair 25% margin. Does that work for you?",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob! Thank you for your continued interest. I understand your budget, but I believe the product is worth a bit more. How about I sell it to you for $110? I think that strikes a balance between your budget and the value of the product.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Thanks for working with me on the price, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $110. I can meet you in the middle at $105. This still gives you a very good profit on your $80 cost. What do you say we close the deal at this price?",105.0,Bob,6,
