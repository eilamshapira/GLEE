Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your product, $140 is quite high for me. The market value for similar products is much lower. I'm willing to pay $90 for it, which would still give you a reasonable profit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. However, $120 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I can go up to $100, which gives you a $20 profit on your $80 cost. That's a fair 25% margin. Does that work for you?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for working with me on the price, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $110. I can meet you in the middle at $105. This still gives you a very good profit on your $80 cost. What do you say we close the deal at this price?
