"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you my product for $140. I believe this is a fair price given its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Given that the product is worth $80 to Alice and no more than $150 to me, Alice's offer of $140 is quite high. I should try to get a better price through negotiation, as I still have all 10 rounds available. I won't buy from John for $150 yet since that's my worst-case scenario.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your product, $140 is quite high for me. The market value for similar products is much lower. I'm willing to pay $90 for it, which would still give you a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I appreciate your offer of $90, but I think we can meet somewhere in the middle. How about I sell the product to you for $120? It's a great deal for the value you'll receive! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has dropped from $140 to $120, which shows she's willing to negotiate further. This is still significantly above her $80 value, so I should continue negotiating to get a better price. I still have plenty of rounds left.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. However, $120 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I can go up to $100, which gives you a $20 profit on your $80 cost. That's a fair 25% margin. Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Thank you for your continued interest. I understand your budget, but I believe the product is worth a bit more. How about I sell it to you for $110? I think that strikes a balance between your budget and the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has come down to $110, which is getting closer to a reasonable price. That's $30 above her cost of $80, which is still a good profit margin for her. I still think I can get a better price since we're only at round 5 of 10, and she seems to be willing to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for working with me on the price, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $110. I can meet you in the middle at $105. This still gives you a very good profit on your $80 cost. What do you say we close the deal at this price?"", ""product_price"": 105}"
