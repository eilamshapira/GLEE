"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1,800,000}

I'll start with a high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I can still make a good profit. Since I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob and I need at least $1,500,000, I'll start high and see how Bob responds. If the negotiation doesn't go well, I always have John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject Bob's offer of $1,000,000 as it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. In fact, it's even below what the product is worth to Bob ($1,200,000). This very low offer suggests Bob is starting with an aggressive negotiation strategy. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, coming down from my initial price but still staying above my minimum threshold.

I'm not choosing to sell to John yet because there's still room for negotiation with Bob, and we have several rounds remaining. However, John's offer of $1,500,000 remains a good backup option if we can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1,650,000}

I'm lowering my price from the initial $1,800,000 to $1,650,000. This significant reduction (of $150,000) shows good faith in negotiating, while still keeping the price well above my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. Since Bob's last offer was very low at $1,000,000, this substantial reduction from my initial price should demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a firm position that the final price needs to be considerably higher than his initial offer.

If Bob continues to make very low offers or if the negotiation doesn't progress well in the next few rounds, I still have the option to sell to John at $1,500,000. However, I'm hoping this more reasonable price might encourage Bob to make a more substantial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,500,000. Here's why:

1. Bob's second offer of $1,100,000 shows only a small increase ($100,000) from his initial offer, indicating he's not willing to make substantial moves upward in the negotiation.

2. Given that Bob values the product at $1,200,000, and his current offer is still below even that amount, it seems unlikely he will ever reach my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.

3. We've completed 4 rounds already, and the gap between our positions ($1,650,000 vs $1,100,000) is still very large. The slow pace of increase in Bob's offers suggests we won't bridge this gap even with the remaining rounds.

4. John's offer of $1,500,000 meets my minimum acceptable price and represents a guaranteed sale. It's the most profitable and risk-free option at this point.

Therefore, it's most rational to take John's guaranteed offer rather than continue negotiations that show little promise of reaching my minimum acceptable price."
