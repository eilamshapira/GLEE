Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 25000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $12,000, I need to decide if I want to try to get a higher price or if I should cut my losses. Since my minimum price is $15,000 and John is offering $15,000, the smart play here is to at least match John's offer.

Therefore:

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```"
