"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $15,000 to Alice and I know I can get it for $15,000 from John, I'll start with a lower offer to negotiate.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice is still offering a price significantly above John's price of $15,000, and I know the product is only worth $15,000 to Alice, it makes the most economic sense to buy from John. There's no guarantee that Alice will lower her price to match or beat John's price in future negotiations, so I'll take the guaranteed better deal."
