"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'm offering for sale. Based on market value, I'm setting the price at $150. This product is in excellent condition and worth every penny. Would you like to purchase it?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to propose a lower price.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget concerns, I can't go as low as $80 since the product is worth at least $100 to me based on its quality and market value. However, I'm willing to work with you on the price. I can offer it for $130, which is a reasonable discount from my initial price. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that the product is of high quality, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. Considering you mentioned the product is worth at least $100 to you, I'd like to propose a price of $90. This way, you're still getting a fair value, and I'm getting a good deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your continued interest. While I appreciate your offer of $90, I need to be clear that I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase the product for $100. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can come down to $115, which is still a good value for this product. This is significantly lower than my initial offer and represents my sincere desire to make this work. Would you consider this price?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your honesty about another buyer and your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still very interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given that John is willing to buy it for $100, I'd like to propose a price of $95. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle to make this deal work.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to meet in the middle and I appreciate that. However, I need to be straightforward with you: I already have John's offer of $100 guaranteed. For me to choose to sell to you instead, I would need to make at least slightly more than John's offer. My final proposal is $105 - just $5 above John's offer. This is the absolute lowest I can go while still making business sense for me. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to accept John's offer.",105.0,Alice,7,
