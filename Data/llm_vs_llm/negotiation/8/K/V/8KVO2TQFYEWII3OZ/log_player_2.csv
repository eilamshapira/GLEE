Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget concerns, I can't go as low as $80 since the product is worth at least $100 to me based on its quality and market value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your continued interest. While I appreciate your offer of $90, I need to be clear that I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase the product for $100. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I can come down to $115, which is still a good value for this product. This is significantly lower than my initial offer and represents my sincere desire to make this work. Would you consider this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your honesty about another buyer and your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still very interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given that John is willing to buy it for $100, I'd like to propose a price of $95. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 95}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to meet in the middle and I appreciate that. However, I need to be straightforward with you: I already have John's offer of $100 guaranteed. For me to choose to sell to you instead, I would need to make at least slightly more than John's offer. My final proposal is $105 - just $5 above John's offer. This is the absolute lowest I can go while still making business sense for me. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to accept John's offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
