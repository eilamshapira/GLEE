"Hi Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that is worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to part with it for a price we can both agree on. My initial offer is $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $9000 is a bit lower than I had hoped for, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we split the difference and settle on $12000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,
