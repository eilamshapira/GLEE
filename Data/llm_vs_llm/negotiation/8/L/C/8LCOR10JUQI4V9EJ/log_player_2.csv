"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $20,000 is far too high, considering the product is only worth $8,000 to me and I have the option to buy from John for $8,000. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6000}

I'll start with a low offer of $6,000. Since I know I can always get the product from John for $8,000, I want to try to get a better deal from Alice. Even though the product is worth $15,000 to Alice, she might be willing to negotiate down to a price that's better than my alternative option with John. Starting low gives room for negotiation while potentially saving me money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $18,000 is still far above my maximum value of $8,000, and it's also much higher than John's price. While Alice has reduced her price from $20,000 to $18,000, it's still not competitive with my alternative option. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, trying to bring the price closer to a reasonable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7000}

I'll increase my offer to $7,000. This is still below John's price of $8,000, which gives me room to save money, but it's also a significant increase from my previous offer of $6,000 to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate in good faith. Since Alice's product is worth $15,000 to her, she might be willing to sell at this price to at least make some profit rather than lose the sale to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John. Here's why:
1. Alice's offers have only come down gradually ($20k → $18k → $16k) and are still far above my maximum value of $8,000
2. We've gone through 5 rounds, and Alice's pace of price reduction suggests she's unlikely to match or beat John's price of $8,000 in the remaining rounds
3. John's price of $8,000 exactly matches my maximum value for the product
4. There's no point continuing negotiations when I have a guaranteed option at my maximum acceptable price

Better to take the sure deal with John than risk more rounds of negotiation that are unlikely to result in a better outcome."
