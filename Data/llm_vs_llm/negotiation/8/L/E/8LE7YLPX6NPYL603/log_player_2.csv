"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $120, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to analyze this situation carefully. 

Alice is offering the product for $120, which is exactly the same price John is willing to sell it to me for ($120). The product is worth $120 to me, so I would be indifferent between these options from a purely financial perspective.

Since there's no price advantage to buying from either seller, and both options would cost me exactly $120, I can choose either option.
