"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand that $140 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not comfortable selling it for $100. I can offer you a discount, though. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $110.  I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm glad you think $110 is a fair price, but I'm still a bit short of my target. How about we compromise at $125? That's the lowest I'm comfortable going.",125.0,Alice,5,
