"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $75 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $150 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $75. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $85. Let's see if we can make this work.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $85. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $100 for the product. How about we try $110? It's a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I see we're getting closer, but $110 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. I can go up to $90. Let me know if this works for you.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, as I mentioned earlier, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $110. I think $100 is a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to pay $100, I'm ready to close the deal. Let me know if this works for you.",100.0,Alice,7,
