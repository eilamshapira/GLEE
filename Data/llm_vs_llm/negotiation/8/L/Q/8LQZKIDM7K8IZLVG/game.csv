"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit higher than I was expecting. I'm looking to spend no more than $13000. Can we meet in the middle?",13000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your position, $13000 is below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $18000, which still offers you great value for this premium product. Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're interested in finding a middle ground. Let's try to meet closer to what works for both of us. How about $17000? This price reflects a significant discount while still respecting the value of the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the discount, Alice, but I'm still looking to spend less. Can we settle at $14000? This way, both of us can walk away feeling good about the deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your willingness to increase your budget, $14000 is still below our minimum. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $16000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and meets you partway.",16000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Let's consider $15500. This is a slight compromise from my last offer and should be within a reasonable range for you, while still respecting the product's value.",15500.0,Alice,5,
