"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I think $150 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product. How about that?",60.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. However, $60 is below my minimum price for the product. I'm willing to come down to $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns. Let's meet halfway. How about $110 for the product? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $70 for the product. How about that?",70.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your new offer. However, $70 is still below what I can accept. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $105? I believe this is a reasonable compromise.",105.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer but still not quite there. Let's try $102. This is my final offer before considering other options. What do you say?",102.0,Alice,5,
