"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Okay, let's analyze the situation.

*   **Alice's offer:** $14,500
*   **My valuation:** $15,000 (maximum I'm willing to pay)
*   **John's offer:** $15,000

Since I can get the product for $14,500, which is less than my maximum willingness to pay ($15,000) and cheaper than buying from John, I should accept Alice's offer.
