Send your offer to Bob.,"I want to start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer of $10,000 is actually quite reasonable. It's well above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and represents a good profit. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's $8,000 offer. A $10,000 deal is a solid outcome.
