"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $60. Would you be willing to consider it?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest, but $60 is quite low for this product. How about I lower my price to $120? I think it's a fair deal. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and lowering your price to $120. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $70. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob! However, I believe the product is worth more than $70. How about we settle at $110? That's a great deal for this quality product. Let me know your thoughts!",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your patience and for lowering the price again. I'm really close to making a decision, but I'd like to try to meet in the middle between your offer and my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80. If you're willing to accept this, I'm ready to make the purchase.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your continued interest, Bob! I appreciate your offer of $80, but I still can't go that low. How about we meet at $100? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be very happy with the product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,7,
