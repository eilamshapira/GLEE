"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer for Round 1:

```json

```"

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","This is not a good offer! I need to make more money. My options are:

*   **Accept Bob's offer:** I lose money.
*   **Sell to John:** I make $12,000, which is better than Bob's offer.
*   **Reject and Counteroffer:** This is my only option to get a higher price.

Here's my decision:

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer for Round 3:

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","This is a tough spot. $11,500 is close to John's offer of $12,000. I need to consider the risk of further negotiation. My goal is to maximize profit.

Here's the breakdown:

*   **Accept Bob's offer:** $11,500.
*   **Sell to John:** $12,000.
*   **Reject and Counteroffer:** Risk - Bob might go lower. Potential Reward - Bob might go higher.

Since John's offer is the better option, I will take it.
