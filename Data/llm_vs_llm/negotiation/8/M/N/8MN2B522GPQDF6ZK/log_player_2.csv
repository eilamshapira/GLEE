"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $8,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $12,000
3. John is offering the same product for $8,000
4. If I accept Alice's offer, I would be paying $4,000 more than my maximum value
5. John's offer matches my maximum value

Since Alice's offer ($12,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's alternative offer ($8,000), the logical choice is to buy from John.
