(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's a decent chance we can get a better price. By rejecting and countering, we signal that we're interested but want a lower price. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 750000}

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.  It allows us to gauge Alice's bottom line and willingness to bargain."
