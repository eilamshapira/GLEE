"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the product for $1600000. I believe it will provide great value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer is $1,600,000
2. My maximum value for the product is $1,200,000
3. John's fixed price is $1,200,000
4. Alice's offer is significantly above both my maximum value and John's price

Alice's initial offer of $1,600,000 is way too high - it's $400,000 above my maximum value. While I could try to negotiate with Alice by rejecting and making a counteroffer, I know a few important things:
1. The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice
2. Alice is unlikely to go below her value of $1,500,000
3. Even if she does lower the price, it would likely still be above $1,200,000

Since John is offering exactly my maximum value ($1,200,000), and Alice's starting point is so high, it makes more sense to just buy from John rather than enter a potentially lengthy negotiation that's unlikely to beat John's price.
