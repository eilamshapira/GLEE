"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in!  I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this:
1. The product is worth up to $150 to me
2. Alice's offer is $130, which is below my maximum value
3. However, since the product is worth $100 to Alice, there might be room for negotiation
4. I still have 9 rounds left to negotiate
5. John's offer of $150 is my worst-case scenario

Given these factors, I'll reject Alice's initial offer of $130 and try to negotiate a better price. Even if negotiations don't work out, I can always buy from John later.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's above Alice's cost but significantly below her initial offer:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer! While I'm definitely interested in the product, $130 is a bit high for me. Given market conditions, I think $110 would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which I think is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this:
1. Alice has moved down from $130 to $120, showing willingness to negotiate
2. The price is $20 above her cost ($100)
3. It's $30 less than my alternative option with John ($150)
4. We still have 7 rounds left, but Alice has shown reasonable movement
5. $120 is a decent price point considering my maximum value of $150

Given that Alice has made a significant concession and $120 represents a good savings compared to John's price, I'll accept this offer. Further negotiation might risk the deal for marginal benefit.
