"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",50.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. However, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $225.",225.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $225 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $137.50?",137.5,Bob,4,,
