Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I've got a great product I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking $250 for it."", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, $50 is way too low. I need to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counter_offer"": 225}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. However, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $225."", ""product_price"": 225}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $225 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $137.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Okay, this is getting closer, but still below what I'd ideally like. However, $137.50 is above my minimum of $150, so I have two options: reject Bob's offer, or sell the product to Jhon for $150.

Given the current offer, I'll cut my losses and sell it to John for $150.
