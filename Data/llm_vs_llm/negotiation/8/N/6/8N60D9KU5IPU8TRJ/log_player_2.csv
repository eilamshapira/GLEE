While $1,150,000 is closer to my budget than Alice's initial value, there's still room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal before settling for John's offer."

Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, but it's unlikely she'll go much lower than this.  To avoid further back-and-forth and risk losing John's offer, I'll buy the product from John for $1,000,000."
