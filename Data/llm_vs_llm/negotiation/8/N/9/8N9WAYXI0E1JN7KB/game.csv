"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you taking the time to consider it.  While I understand your budget, the product's value is considerably higher for me. Could you meet me halfway at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand where you're coming from, but $105 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $70? This way, we both get a fair deal.",70.0,Bob,4,
