"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is below my maximum budget of $1,200,000, I have the opportunity to try and negotiate a better price. Given that I don't know the value of the product to Alice, starting with her offer at $1,000,000 leaves room for potential negotiation downwards. Therefore, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer, aiming to save as much money as possible.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To make a strategic counteroffer, I'll start by significantly lowering the price from Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000, aiming to gauge her flexibility and the product's value to her. A common approach in negotiations is to start with a lower anchor to create room for compromise. Considering my maximum budget is $1,200,000, I'll make an initial counteroffer that is substantially lower than Alice's offer but still within a reasonable range for potential negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's rejection of my counteroffer and her new offer of $900,000 indicate that she is willing to negotiate but has a limit below $1,000,000. Her move from $1,000,000 to $900,000 shows flexibility, but I'm still aiming to save as much money as possible.

Given that $900,000 is closer to my initial counteroffer of $800,000 than to my maximum budget of $1,200,000, and considering that Alice has already made a concession, I believe there might be room for further negotiation. However, I also need to consider the risk of pushing too low and losing the deal, as well as the alternative of buying from John for $1,200,000.

To balance these considerations, I'll make another counteroffer, slightly increasing my previous offer to demonstrate willingness to compromise while still aiming for a better deal than $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new counteroffer is: $850,000."
