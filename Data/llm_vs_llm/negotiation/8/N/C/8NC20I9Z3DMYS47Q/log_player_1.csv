"Round 1

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","$900,000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and significantly below the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000). Since we're only in round 2 of 10, I have plenty of time to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make a counter offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","While Bob has increased his offer by $50,000, showing some flexibility, there's still significant room for negotiation given that the product is worth $1,500,000 to him. We're only in round 4 of 10, so I still have time to negotiate for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll continue to move towards a middle ground, but still maintain a strong position given the product's value to Bob.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob is slowly increasing his offers ($900k → $950k → $975k), showing he's willing to negotiate upward, but in small increments. While $975,000 is significantly better than John's $800,000, we still have 4 rounds left and the product is worth $1.5M to Bob. I believe there's still room for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given that we're now in round 7 of 10, I'll make a more moderate reduction to show willingness to reach an agreement while still seeking a good profit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob has only increased his offer by $5,000 this time ($975k to $980k), showing smaller increments. While we still have 2 rounds left, there's also a risk that Bob might start decreasing his offers if he thinks we're not making enough progress. At $980,000, this is a decent profit margin above my minimum of $800,000, and while it's not as high as I hoped, it's a reasonable deal.
