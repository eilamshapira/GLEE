"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm more comfortable with a price of $8000 considering my budget and market alternatives. Let me know if we can work out a deal at this price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. While I understand budget constraints, $8000 is the absolute minimum value of this product to me. Given its quality and market value, I believe $10500 is a more reasonable price. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my willingness to work with you. Would you consider meeting me in the middle?",10500.0,Alice,3,
