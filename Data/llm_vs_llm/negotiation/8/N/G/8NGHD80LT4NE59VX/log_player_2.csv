"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

You can get the product for $10,000 from John, and Alice is offering it for $9,500, so it's better to reject Alice's offer and see if she will lower the price."
