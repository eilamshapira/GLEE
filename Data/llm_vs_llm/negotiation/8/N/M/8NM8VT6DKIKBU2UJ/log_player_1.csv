Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","$50 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and is not even close to a reasonable negotiation point. Since I can sell to John for $120, and Bob's offer is so low, it might indicate he's not a serious buyer.

Let me counter with a lower price than my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 150}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I already sent my counteroffer in my previous response:

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer of $75 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and his small increase from $50 to $75 suggests he might not be willing to reach a price point that would be acceptable to me. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, and Bob seems unwilling to approach this price point, it would be most profitable to end the negotiation with Bob.
