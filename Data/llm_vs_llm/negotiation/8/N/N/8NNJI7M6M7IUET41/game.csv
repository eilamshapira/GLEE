"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $6000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you!",6000.0,Bob,2,
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. Unfortunately, $6000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $18000, considering it's you. Let me know if this revised offer works for you!",18000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to meet a certain threshold. I'm willing to lower the price further to $17000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $7000. This is my final offer before I consider other options. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,4,
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but $7000 is still below our minimum threshold. I can go as low as $16000, which is the best I can do. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to consider other buyers. Let me know your decision.",16000.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is challenging, but I need to stick to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16000. This is my final offer before I have to consider other buyers. Let me know if you can accept this price.",16000.0,Alice,5,
