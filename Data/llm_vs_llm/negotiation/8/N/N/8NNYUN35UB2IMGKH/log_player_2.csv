# Bob's message:
Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $2,000,000 is quite steep for me. I'm looking to spend no more than $1,200,000. Would you be willing to lower your price accordingly and if so by how much?"

Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $900,000 to meet you in the middle. How does that sound?"
