"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its value and value it can bring to you, I'm confident that you'll find our asking price of $1100000 quite reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me (my maximum value)
2. Alice's offer is $1,100,000
3. John's fixed price is $1,200,000
4. The product is worth $800,000 to Alice

Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is below my maximum value ($1,200,000), but it's significantly above Alice's value ($800,000). There's room for negotiation since we still have 9 more rounds, and I could potentially get a better price. John's price ($1,200,000) serves as a backup option but is the highest price I'd pay.

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably above Alice's cost ($800,000) but significantly lower than her initial offer, leaving room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, I believe your asking price is quite high. Given market conditions and considering our mutual interest in making a deal, I would like to offer $900,000 for the product. This represents a significant profit margin for you while being a more reasonable price point for me."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your perspective, I must decline as the offered amount doesn't align with our target margins. However, I'm committed to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. After careful consideration, I'm willing to lower our asking price to $1000000. This revised offer demonstrates our eagerness to work with you while still maintaining a profitable outcome for our side. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let's analyze the situation:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $1,100,000 to $1,000,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. We started at $1,100,000, I countered with $900,000, and now she's meeting in the middle at $1,000,000
3. This is $200,000 less than John's price
4. We still have 7 more rounds of negotiation possible
5. The gap between Alice's cost ($800,000) and her current offer ($1,000,000) is still quite large

While $1,000,000 is better than the initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. Given that we have several rounds left and the price is still significantly above Alice's cost, I should continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that moves slightly higher than my previous offer but still maintains pressure for a better price.

{""message"": ""Thank you for reducing your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe we can find a more balanced price point that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $940,000, which would provide you with a very healthy profit margin while being more aligned with my budget constraints. This represents a significant movement from my previous offer and shows my sincere interest in reaching an agreement."", ""product_price"": 940000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for continuing to work with us. While we're eager to strike a deal, your last offer is still a bit low for us to accept. To show our commitment to this negotiation, we're willing to lower our price to $970000. This offer represents a significant compromise on our part, and we hope it encourages you to meet us at this new price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let's analyze the current situation:

1. Alice has moved down again from $1,000,000 to $970,000
2. The negotiation pattern shows steady progress:
   - Alice: $1,100,000 → $1,000,000 → $970,000
   - Me: $900,000 → $940,000
3. The gap between our last positions is narrowing ($970,000 vs $940,000 = $30,000 difference)
4. We still have 5 more rounds available
5. The current offer is $230,000 less than John's price
6. Alice is showing consistent willingness to negotiate downward

While we're getting closer, there's still a small gap that could potentially be narrowed. However, Alice's incremental decreases are getting smaller, suggesting we're approaching her limit. Given that we still have several rounds left and the gap is relatively small, I'll make one more attempt to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that we're getting closer and the gap is narrowing, I'll make a more modest increase to try to meet in the middle.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility in this negotiation. We're getting quite close to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Looking at our recent offers, I can see we're not far apart. I'm willing to raise my offer to $955,000, which is nearly meeting you in the middle. This represents a fair compromise for both parties, providing you with a substantial profit while still being within my budget constraints. I hope we can finalize our deal at this price point."", ""product_price"": 955000}"
