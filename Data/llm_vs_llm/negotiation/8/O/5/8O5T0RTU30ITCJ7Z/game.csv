"Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product to offer you today. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $120. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $80. Would you be willing to consider it?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $80 is lower than what I can accept given the product's value. I can come down from my initial price - how about $105? This is a significant reduction from my first offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the quality you'll receive.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $92.50. Would you be willing to consider it?",92.5,Bob,4,
