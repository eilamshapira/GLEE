"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product to offer you today. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $120. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $80. Would you be willing to consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed offer of $80, but we still have 8 rounds of negotiation left, it's strategic to try to get a better price from Bob. I know the product is worth more than $80, so I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $80 is lower than what I can accept given the product's value. I can come down from my initial price - how about $105? This is a significant reduction from my first offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the quality you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $92.50. Would you be willing to consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $92.50. This is a good outcome because:
1. It's $12.50 more than John's guaranteed offer of $80
2. Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate but might not go much higher
3. We've already gone through 4 rounds, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing this favorable offer
4. The offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $80"
