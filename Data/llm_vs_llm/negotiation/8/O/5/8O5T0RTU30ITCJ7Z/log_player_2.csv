"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product to offer you today. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $120. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the offer of $120 is above my budget of $100, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonably low, but still shows that I'm interested in the product. Since I'm looking to spend no more than $100, I'll offer $80.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $80. Would you be willing to consider it?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $80 is lower than what I can accept given the product's value. I can come down from my initial price - how about $105? This is a significant reduction from my first offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the quality you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice's new offer of $105 is still above my budget of $100. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $100, I don't see a reason to accept Alice's offer. I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $120 to $105, I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer of $80 and her current offer of $105. I'll offer $92.50.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $92.50. Would you be willing to consider it?"", ""product_price"": 92.50}"
