(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,500,000, I will reject her offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a price that is close to my maximum budget, but leaves some room for negotiation.

However, it's lower than her initial offer, which suggests that she's willing to negotiate. I'll reject her offer again and make another counteroffer to see if I can get her to lower the price further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer of $1,700,000 is still higher than my target price, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one, but still below Alice's current offer. This should give her an incentive to consider my offer while also leaving some room for further negotiation.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,600,000 is getting closer to my maximum budget of $1,500,000, but it's still $100,000 above what I'm willing to pay. Since we're halfway through the negotiation rounds, I'll reject her offer again and try to make a more aggressive counteroffer to see if I can get her to lower the price further.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one, but still below Alice's current offer. I'll try to meet her halfway between her current offer and my maximum budget.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my maximum budget of $1,500,000, and it's only $50,000 above what I'm willing to pay. Considering that I can buy the product from John for $1,500,000, I think it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. I'll choose to buy the product from John instead, as it's the best option for me at this point.
