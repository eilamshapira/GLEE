"Alice's offer: The product price will be $799,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $799,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $799,999
2. John's price: $800,000
3. My maximum value: $800,000

Alice's offer is $1 less than John's price and $1 less than my maximum value. While the difference is minimal, it still saves me money compared to buying from John.
