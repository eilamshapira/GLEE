"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $250 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. $80 is a little too low for me, as I value this product at no less than $120. How about we meet in the middle a bit? I can come down to $220.",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $220. However, I still think it's a bit too high for me. You mentioned that you value the product at no less than $120, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. I believe this is a reasonable price that we can both agree on.",100.0,Bob,4,
