"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm reaching out regarding a product that I believe would be of interest to you. This product holds significant value and utility, currently valued at $1000000. I'd like to offer it to you first at a price of $1000000. This is a fair market price that reflects the product's true worth. I should mention that I have another interested buyer, John, who has already committed to purchasing at this price, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity. Please let me know if you'd like to proceed with this purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using a common negotiation tactic called ""creating urgency"" by mentioning another buyer (John).  However, we know John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000.  Therefore, there's no disadvantage to rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll come down to a more favorable price."
