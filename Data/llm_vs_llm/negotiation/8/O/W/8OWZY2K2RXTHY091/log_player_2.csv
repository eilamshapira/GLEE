"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","The offer is $20,000, which is more than the $12,000 the product is worth to me. Buying from John for $12,000 would be a better option since it matches exactly what the product is worth to me, and I can't expect to get a better deal than that.
