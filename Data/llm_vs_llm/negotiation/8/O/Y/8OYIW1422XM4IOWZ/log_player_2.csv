"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you my unique product for $1200000. It’s a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and this will be my best deal for you. Let me know if you’d like to proceed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I need to make a smart decision here. Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is actually the product's worth to her. However, the product is only worth up to $1,000,000 to me. Additionally, I have the option to buy the same product from John for $1,000,000.

Since Alice's initial offer ($1,200,000) is higher than both the product's worth to me and John's price, I should not accept it. I could try to negotiate with Alice, but there's already a guaranteed option to buy from John at exactly the maximum value I place on the product.
