Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $2000000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1000000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $1,000,000 is lower than my minimum acceptable price, but I'm also not willing to sell it to him for that amount when I have a better option with John for $1,200,000. My counteroffer will be $1,800,000, trying to meet Bob somewhere in the middle while still aiming high. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $2,000,000 might be out of your budget, but I believe the product's value is closer to that. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. How about $1,800,000?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}"

Bob's offer:

Since Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below the price that John is willing to pay ($1,200,000), and I've already established that the product is worth no less than $1,200,000 to me, it makes more sense to sell the product to John for $1,200,000 rather than continuing to negotiate with Bob at a lower price."
