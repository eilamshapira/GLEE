Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to set a price that maximizes my earnings while considering Bob might reject it if too high.

My minimum acceptable price is $120 (what I can get from John).

I'll set the price somewhat higher than my minimum, but not so high that Bob would likely reject it outright. Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll choose a moderate markup.

{""product_price"": 180}"
