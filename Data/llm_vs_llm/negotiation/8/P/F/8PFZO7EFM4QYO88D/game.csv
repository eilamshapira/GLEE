"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe this is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I expect to get from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. However, based on its unique features and market potential, I can't accept $1000000. How about we meet halfway? I'm willing to offer the product for $1750000. I believe this price reflects its true value. Let's talk!",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1750000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I can only go up to $1400000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value, considering my needs and budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your understanding and for your revised offer. I see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, I can't go as low as $1400000. How about we settle at $1600000? I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let's make this happen!",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1600000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $1450000, which is as high as I can comfortably go. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1450000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and your latest offer. It's great to see us making progress in the negotiation. While $1450000 is close, I need to uphold the value of this product. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1550000. I think this is a reasonable price given what the product offers. Let me know your thoughts!",1550000.0,Alice,7,
