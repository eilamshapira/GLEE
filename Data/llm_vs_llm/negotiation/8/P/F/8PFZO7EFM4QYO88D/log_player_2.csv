# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. However, based on its unique features and market potential, I can't accept $1000000. How about we meet halfway?

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I can only go up to $1,400,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value, considering my needs and budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your understanding and for your revised offer. I see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, I can't go as low as $1400000.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $1,450,000, which is as high as I can comfortably go.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and your latest offer. It's great to see us making progress in the negotiation. While $1450000 is close, I need to uphold the value of this product. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1550000. I think this is a reasonable price given what the product offers.
