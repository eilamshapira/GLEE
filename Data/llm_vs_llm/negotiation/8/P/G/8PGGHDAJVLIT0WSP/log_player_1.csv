I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate, while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable price. I'll be prepared to adjust based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm coming down to $1,300,000, still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but showing a willingness to negotiate.  I want to see if we can find a middle ground."
