Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to offer a price to Bob that is attractive enough for him to accept, while maximizing my profit. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and only $8,000 to me, there's room for a deal that benefits both of us.

If I price it too high, Bob might reject the offer, and I'd have to sell to John for $8,000. If I price it too low, I'm leaving money on the table.

A reasonable approach is to set a price that gives Bob some value while still being significantly better than my fallback option of $8,000.
