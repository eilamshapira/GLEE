"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us. To start, I'd like to propose a price of $18000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $8000 for the product. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer.  I could consider letting it go for $14000.  This is a fair offer considering its true worth.  What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14000 is still above what I can afford. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $9000. Let me know if this works for you.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $9000 is quite a bit lower than I'd hoped for. How about we meet in the middle at $11500? That's me really trying to make this work. ",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $11500 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we settle at $9500? I think this is a fair compromise given my constraints.",9500.0,Bob,6,
