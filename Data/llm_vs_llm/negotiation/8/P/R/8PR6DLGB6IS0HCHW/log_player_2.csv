"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to consider the best decision economically.

Alice is offering the product for $15,000, while John is willing to sell it for $12,000. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me.

Since Alice's offer ($15,000) exceeds both the product's worth to me and John's price, the rational choice is to buy from John.
