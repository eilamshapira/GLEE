"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than my maximum valuation of $12,000, and John is offering the product at exactly $12,000, it makes the most economic sense to buy from John. There's no reason to pay $8,000 more for the same product.
