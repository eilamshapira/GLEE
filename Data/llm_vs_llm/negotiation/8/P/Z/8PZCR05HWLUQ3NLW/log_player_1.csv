Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $170. I think you'll find it's worth the price for its quality and features."",
""product_price"": 170
}
```

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""quality and features,"" you aim to subtly reframe the value proposition in Bob's mind, potentially justifying a higher price.
* **Alternative in Mind:** Remember, you have John willing to pay $150. This knowledge gives you leverage to hold firm if Bob tries to negotiate too low."
