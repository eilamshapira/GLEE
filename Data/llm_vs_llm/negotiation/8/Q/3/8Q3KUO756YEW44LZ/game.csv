"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2.5 million is significantly above my budget and market value for this type of product. I'm willing to offer $600000, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions. I look forward to your response.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $600000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. The product's unique qualities and the value it brings far exceed that figure. I am willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $2300000?",2300000.0,Alice,3,
