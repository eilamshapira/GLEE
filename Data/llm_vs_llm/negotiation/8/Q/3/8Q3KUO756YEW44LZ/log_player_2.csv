"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unparalleled value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2500000. I believe this investment will be highly rewarding for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that my maximum value for the product is $800,000, Alice's offer of $2,500,000 is way too high - more than three times my maximum value. There's no reason to accept this offer when I can buy from John for $800,000. However, let me first try to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower but still reasonable as a starting point for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2.5 million is significantly above my budget and market value for this type of product. I'm willing to offer $600,000, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions. I look forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $600000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. The product's unique qualities and the value it brings far exceed that figure. I am willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $2300000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $2,300,000 is still nearly three times my maximum value of $800,000. While she did reduce her price by $200,000, the reduction is minimal compared to the gap between our positions. She seems to value the product much higher than I do, and her response to my counteroffer suggests she's unlikely to come down to a price near my range. Given that I can buy from John for $800,000 (my maximum value), and Alice seems unwilling to negotiate within a reasonable range, it's best to end the negotiation and go with John's offer.
