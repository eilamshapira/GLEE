"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since the product is worth $800,000 to me and Alice's offer of $850,000 exceeds that value, it doesn't make sense to accept the offer as it is more than what the product is worth to me. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $800,000, which aligns with its value to me. However, before making a final decision, I might as well try to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Therefore, the best course of action at this point is to reject Alice's offer and proceed with making a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that the product is worth $800,000 to me and I'm trying to save as much money as possible, my initial counteroffer should be lower than Alice's offer but still within a reasonable range to encourage further negotiation. A good starting point could be to offer a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to create room for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $800,000 matches the value of the product to me and is also the same price that John is offering. At this point, since Alice has met the maximum value I'm willing to pay, there's no need to continue negotiating or try to find a better deal, as I've already reached the threshold of what the product is worth to me.

Moreover, buying from Alice at this price is just as good as buying from John, given that the prices are the same. Therefore, I can accept Alice's offer without worrying about overpaying or missing out on a potentially better deal from John.
