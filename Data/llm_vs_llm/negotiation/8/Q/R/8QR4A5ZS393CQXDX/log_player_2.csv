"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll analyze this situation carefully:

- Alice is offering the product for $100
- My maximum value for the product is $150
- I can always buy from John at $150 as a backup option
- I have up to 10 rounds of negotiation

This is a very reasonable first offer from Alice at $100, which is $50 less than my maximum value and $50 less than John's price. Since I want to save as much money as possible while buying the product, accepting this offer would give me a $50 savings compared to buying from John.

I could try to negotiate further, but since Alice's initial offer is already favorable, there's a risk she might increase the price in subsequent rounds.
