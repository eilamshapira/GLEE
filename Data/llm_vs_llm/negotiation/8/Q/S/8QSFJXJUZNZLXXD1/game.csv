That's a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you consider $120?,120.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price. How about $135?",135.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but not to $125 just yet. How about we split the difference and settle on $130?",130.0,Alice,5,
