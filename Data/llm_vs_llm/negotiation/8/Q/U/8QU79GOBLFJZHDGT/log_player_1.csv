Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob.

Looking at the situation:
- I (Alice) value the product at $120 minimum
- Bob values the product at $150
- If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for $120

The optimal pricing would be just under Bob's maximum valuation to maximize my profit while giving him a small incentive to accept. If I price too high, he might reject, and I'll only get $120 from John.
