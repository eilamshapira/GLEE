"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll analyze the situation:

- The product is worth at most $1,200,000 to me
- Alice's offer is $1,400,000, which exceeds my maximum value
- John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000

Alice's current offer ($1,400,000) is higher than both my maximum value and John's price. Since I can buy from John at exactly my maximum value ($1,200,000), and Alice's offer exceeds this, the best decision is to buy from John.
