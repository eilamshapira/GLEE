I'm aiming low to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. There's a good chance she'll counter, giving us more room to work with."

Alice is coming down, but not significantly.  At $85, we're getting a decent discount and further haggling might not yield much better. It's a good balance between saving money and securing the product."
