"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,500,000, it would be unwise to accept it. Additionally, buying from John for $1,500,000 is an option, but I'd like to try and negotiate a better price with Alice first. Therefore, the best course of action is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of reaching a mutually agreeable price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range, considering my maximum budget is $1,500,000. A good starting point could be around $1,000,000, which gives room for negotiation while also being serious about purchasing the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's new offer of $1,500,000 matches my maximum budget and is the same price that John is offering. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible and Alice's offer is now at the upper limit of what I'm willing to pay, I have to consider that further negotiation might not yield a better price. Given that John's offer is the same and I don't have any additional information that would suggest Alice's product is superior or that there are benefits to buying from her over John at this price point, the most cost-effective decision would be to buy from John, as it achieves my goal of not exceeding $1,500,000 without the need for further negotiation.
