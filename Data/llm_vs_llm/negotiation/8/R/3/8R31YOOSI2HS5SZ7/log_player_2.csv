"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $80
2. Alice's offer is $120, which is $40 more than my maximum value
3. John's offer is $80, which exactly matches my maximum value
4. If I buy from Alice, I'll be paying more than the product is worth to me
5. If I buy from John, I'll be paying exactly what the product is worth to me

Since Alice's offer ($120) is above my maximum value ($80), and John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value, the rational choice would be to buy from John.
