"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its features and value, I'm pricing it at $230. This product has excellent market value and I believe this is a fair price. Would you like to purchase it?",230.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand that the product has excellent market value, but $230 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80, considering the product's features and my own financial constraints.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly below the value of this product. My cost is $150, so I cannot go below that price. However, I can reduce my initial offer. How about $195? This is already a good discount from my original price, and the product's quality and features justify this value.",195.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $195 is still a bit steep for me. Considering your cost is $150, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. This price takes into account the product's value and my budget, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $120 is still below my cost of $150. I can't sell the product at a loss. I'm willing to come down to $180, which represents a significant discount from my original price and offers you good value while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. This is a quality product that's worth the investment.",180.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $180 is still above my budget. Since you mentioned your cost is $150, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $140. This price is closer to your cost and takes into account the product's value, while also being more manageable for me.",140.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $140 is still below my cost of $150. I simply cannot sell below my cost price. I notice John is willing to pay the full $150, which is my minimum acceptable price. If you can meet me at $165, which is still a significant discount from my original asking price, we can close this deal. Otherwise, I'll need to accept John's offer.",165.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you can't sell below your cost price of $150. I'm willing to meet you closer to that price. How about $155? This is slightly above your cost, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiation so far.",155.0,Bob,8,
