Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand that the product has excellent market value, but $230 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80, considering the product's features and my own financial constraints.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $180 is still above my budget.
