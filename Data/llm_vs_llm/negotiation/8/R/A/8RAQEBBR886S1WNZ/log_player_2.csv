Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly below the value of this product. My cost is $150, so I cannot go below that price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $140 is still below my cost of $150. I simply cannot sell below my cost price.
