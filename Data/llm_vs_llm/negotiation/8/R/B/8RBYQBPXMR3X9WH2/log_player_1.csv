Round 3

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob for Round 5:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offers, but we're still far apart. Look, I'm willing to come down to $150, but that's my absolute bottom line. This is a great product, and I think you'll find it's worth it at this price."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I think at this point, it's best to cut my losses and take the sure thing.

My decision is:
