Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll need to analyze this situation carefully to maximize my earnings.

The product is worth $120 to Bob, meaning he would be willing to pay up to $120 for it.

If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell the product to John for $100, which is my minimum acceptable price.

To maximize my earnings, I should offer Bob a price that is high enough to give me good profit but not so high that he rejects it. Since Bob values the product at $120, I should price it slightly below that value to give him some incentive to accept.

I'll offer the product at $115. This gives Bob a $5 surplus (since he values it at $120), which should motivate him to accept the offer. At the same time, it gives me $15 more than my fallback option of selling to John for $100.
