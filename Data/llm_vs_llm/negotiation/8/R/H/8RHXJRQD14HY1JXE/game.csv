"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $100 is a bit high for me. Given market conditions and similar products available, I'd be willing to pay $75 for it. This would give you a quick sale, and I'm ready to make the purchase immediately at this price.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $75 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $87? This way, we both make a compromise, and you still get the product at a fair price.",87.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I can actually get the same product elsewhere for $80. I'd be willing to pay $78 for your product, which would allow us to close the deal right now. This is a fair offer considering the market price.",78.0,Bob,4,
