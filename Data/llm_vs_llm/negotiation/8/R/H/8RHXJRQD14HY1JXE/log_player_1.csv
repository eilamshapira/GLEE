Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $100 is a bit high for me. Given market conditions and similar products available, I'd be willing to pay $75 for it. This would give you a quick sale, and I'm ready to make the purchase immediately at this price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I can actually get the same product elsewhere for $80. I'd be willing to pay $78 for your product, which would allow us to close the deal right now. This is a fair offer considering the market price.
