"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $100. It's a great product and I think you'll find it very useful. Are you interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $80 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $100, which is $20 more than my maximum value
3. John is offering it for $80, which matches my maximum value
4. Since this is just round 1, I can try to negotiate with Alice to get a better price

Since Alice's initial offer is too high, and I have room to negotiate, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. There's no reason to accept $100 when I can either:
a) Negotiate with Alice for a better price
b) Fall back on John's $80 offer if negotiations fail

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's asking price but not insultingly low, considering the product's value to her is $80.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $100 is a bit high for me. Given market conditions and similar products available, I'd be willing to pay $75 for it. This would give you a quick sale, and I'm ready to make the purchase immediately at this price."", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $75 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $87? This way, we both make a compromise, and you still get the product at a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice has come down from $100 to $87, showing willingness to negotiate
2. However, $87 is still above John's price of $80
3. The $80 from John equals my maximum value
4. Alice's new offer of $87 would mean I'm paying $7 more than necessary

Since I can get the same product from John for $80, and Alice's current offer is still above that price, there's no reason to accept this offer. However, since Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing her price significantly, I'll reject and try one more counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has shown flexibility by coming down to $87, and we know her cost is $80, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's slightly below John's price to give her incentive to close the deal.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I can actually get the same product elsewhere for $80. I'd be willing to pay $78 for your product, which would allow us to close the deal right now. This is a fair offer considering the market price."", ""product_price"": 78}"
