"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1500000 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $1200000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Would you consider $1000000 for the product? This would give you a quick sale, and I can make the payment immediately.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $1000000 is significantly below what I need to achieve for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,
