Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1500000 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell me the same product for $1200000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Would you consider $1000000 for the product? This would give you a quick sale, and I can make the payment immediately. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
