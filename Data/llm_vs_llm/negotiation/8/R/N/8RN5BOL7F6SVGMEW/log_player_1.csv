"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $1,000,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a high offer to Bob to see if there's potential for an even better deal.

{""product_price"": 1,200,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer ($800,000) is lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000) and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $1,000,000, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Bob. The best decision is to sell to John.
