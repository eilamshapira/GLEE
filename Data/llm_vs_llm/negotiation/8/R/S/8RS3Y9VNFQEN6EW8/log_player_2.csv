"Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $25,000, this is significantly higher than the maximum value of $8,000 that the product is worth to me. It also exceeds the guaranteed alternative of buying from John for $8,000.

Since I can get the exact same product from John for $8,000, and my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, the logical choice is to buy from John.
