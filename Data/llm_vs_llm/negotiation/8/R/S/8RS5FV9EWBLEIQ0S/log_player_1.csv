"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you Alice, the product is good but I think that $1000000 is more reasonable price for it. Would you agree to sell it for $1000000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer as $1,000,000 is still a bit lower than what I believe is fair. Bob's willingness to offer $1M suggests there might be room for negotiation at a higher price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While $1,000,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, given the product's quality and value, I believe $1,100,000 would be a more appropriate price. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it represents a fair middle ground. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I believe that $1050000 is a more suitable price for the product. Would you be open to this valuation? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob has made a reasonable counteroffer that splits the difference between our positions. The price of $1,050,000 represents a good profit margin above my minimum threshold of $800,000, and we've reached a fair compromise. It's better to secure this deal now rather than risk prolonging negotiations that might lead to a less favorable outcome."
