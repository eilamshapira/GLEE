"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be beneficial for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $12000. This represents the fair market value of the product. I know you'll find this product worth the investment. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth $12,000 to me (my maximum value)
2. Alice is offering it for $12,000
3. John is also selling it for $12,000

Since all prices are exactly the same ($12,000), and it's equal to my maximum value, I'm indifferent between these options. However, since Alice has already engaged in communication and made the offer, it would be more practical to complete the transaction with her rather than starting a new transaction with John.
