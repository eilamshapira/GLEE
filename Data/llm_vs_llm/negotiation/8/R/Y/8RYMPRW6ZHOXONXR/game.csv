"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will bring you a lot of benefit. How about we meet in the middle at $8750?",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. While $7500 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $8250. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",8250.0,Alice,5,
