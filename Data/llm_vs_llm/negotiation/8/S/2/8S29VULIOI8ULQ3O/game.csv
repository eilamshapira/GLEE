"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe a price of $950000 would be more aligned with my budget. Let me know if we can work something out.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product has immense value, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1150000? This reflects the true worth of this opportunity.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your stance and the value of the product. However, I am hoping we can find common ground at $1050000. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1050000 is closer to the mark, it's still a significant gap from my initial asking price. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
