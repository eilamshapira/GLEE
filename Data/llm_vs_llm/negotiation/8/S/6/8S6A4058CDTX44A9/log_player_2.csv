"Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer of $170 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($120) and John's price ($120), it wouldn't be rational to accept this offer. Also, since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value point ($120), and any successful negotiation with Alice would need to be below $150 (her value) but above $120 (her cost), it makes the most sense to simply buy from John.
