"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a product that I'm sure will be valuable to you. I know this item is worth a good amount, and it's in excellent condition. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $120
2. Alice is offering the product for $100
3. John's fixed price is $120
4. The product is worth $80 to Alice

Given these facts:
- Alice's offer ($100) is better than John's price ($120)
- The price is within my maximum value ($120)
- While Alice is making a $20 profit ($100 - $80), I'm still saving $20 compared to buying from John

Since Alice's offer is $20 less than my alternative option (John's price), and it's within my maximum value, it makes economic sense to accept Alice's offer.
