"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1800000 is beyond my budget. I am willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product, considering its value to me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's inherent value and market potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1600000. This offer reflects a fair compromise, wouldn't you agree?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $1600000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1300000. This is a significant step up from my last offer and reflects my maximum budget for this product. Can we meet in the middle?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $1300000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to accept $1450000, but that's my absolute best offer.  I think this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",1450000.0,Alice,5,
