"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's offer is $10,000, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and buying from John would also cost me $10,000, I might as well buy from Alice as it doesn't make a difference in terms of price.
