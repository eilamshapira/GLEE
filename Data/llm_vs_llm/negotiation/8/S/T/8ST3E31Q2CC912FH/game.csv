"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $300 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to buy the product for $80. I think it's a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but $80 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I can do $250.",250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $100. I think it's a more reasonable price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I can come down to $220. That's the lowest I can realistically go while still making it worth my while.",220.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $220 is still above my budget. I'm willing to stretch a bit and offer $110. If we can't meet at this price, I may need to consider other options.",110.0,Bob,6,
