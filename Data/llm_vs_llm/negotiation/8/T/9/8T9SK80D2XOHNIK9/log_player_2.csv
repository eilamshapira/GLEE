"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm offering it to you for $14999. This is a great opportunity to acquire something that is of very high quality. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Looking at the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to you
2. Alice is offering to sell it for $14,999
3. John is offering the same product for $8,000

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both what the product is worth to you and John's alternative price. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer when you can get the same product at a much better price.
