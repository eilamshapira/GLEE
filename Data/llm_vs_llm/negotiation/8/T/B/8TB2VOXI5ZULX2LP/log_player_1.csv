Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $13,000 since it's below the minimum value of $15,000 that the product is worth to me. Moreover, it's lower than John's guaranteed offer of $15,000.

For the next round, I'll make a lower counteroffer than my initial one, but still above $15,000."
