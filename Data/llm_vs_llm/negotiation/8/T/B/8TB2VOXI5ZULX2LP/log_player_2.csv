"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $19,500 is significantly higher than the product's worth to me ($15,000) and higher than John's alternative offer ($15,000). It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as there's room for negotiation to get a better price than both Alice's current offer and John's fixed price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 13000}

I'll make a counteroffer of $13,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation because:
1. It's below John's price of $15,000, giving me room to negotiate upward
2. It's below Alice's cost ($15,000), but not so low as to be insulting
3. It allows room for back-and-forth negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial price
4. Even if Alice counters higher, we still have several rounds to find a middle ground that's better than John's offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Alice's offer of $17,000 because:
1. It's still higher than John's fixed price of $15,000
2. There's no reason to accept a price higher than what I can get from John
3. We still have several rounds of negotiation left, and Alice has already shown willingness to lower her price (from $19,500 to $17,000)
4. I can make another counteroffer closer to or at my target price

I'll continue negotiating to try to get a better price than John's $15,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 14000}

I'll make a counteroffer of $14,000. This is a strategic choice because:
1. It shows significant movement from my previous offer of $13,000, demonstrating good faith negotiation
2. It's still below John's price of $15,000, giving me a better deal if accepted
3. It's closer to Alice's cost ($15,000), making it more likely for her to consider
4. If Alice rejects this, I still have John's offer as a backup
5. We're moving closer to finding a middle ground between our positions"
