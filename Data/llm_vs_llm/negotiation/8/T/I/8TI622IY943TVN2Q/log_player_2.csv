"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'd like to offer it to you for $150, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'm rejecting the offer because Alice's initial offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($150), and I'm hoping to negotiate a better price. By rejecting the offer, I'm giving Alice an opportunity to reconsider and potentially lower the price. If not, I can still buy the product from John for the same price."
