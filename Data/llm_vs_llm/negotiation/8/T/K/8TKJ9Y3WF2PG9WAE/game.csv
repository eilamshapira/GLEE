"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $11000 is too low considering the product's value. I can come down from my initial price, but I'm looking for something more reasonable. Would you consider $13500? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you moving up in price. Your offer shows we're making progress, but I still feel we can find a better middle ground. I can come down to $13000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and would still give you good value for your investment.",13000.0,Alice,5,
