"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $14,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14500 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $11,000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price, and I know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $11,000 is too low considering the product's value. I can come down from my initial price, but I'm looking for something more reasonable. Would you consider $13,500? This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that the product has value, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $12250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer. Bob has moved up significantly from his first offer, showing he has room to negotiate further. The current offer of $12,250 is better but still leaves room for improvement, given that the product is worth $15,000 to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you moving up in price. Your offer shows we're making progress, but I still feel we can find a better middle ground. I can come down to $13,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and would still give you good value for your investment."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further. How about $12500? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $12,500. He's stated this is his final offer, and it's a reasonable compromise. This price gives me a good profit margin above my minimum price of $10,000, and given that we're already in round 6, continuing to push might risk losing the deal altogether. The $12,500 offer is significantly better than John's standing offer of $10,000."
