Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. I'd like to make a counteroffer that I believe is more reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob, as $10,000 is still lower than my initial offer, and I believe the product is worth more to him. I'll try to meet him halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. 

My counteroffer: $12,500"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was thinking that we could do a bit better than that. I'd like to propose a price that's slightly lower, but still reflects the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make another counteroffer to Bob, as $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Since Bob is willing to negotiate and has increased his offer, I'll try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.

My counteroffer: $12,000"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the effort you're putting into finding a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to meet you close to your current offer, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price to see if we can finalize the deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I think Bob's latest offer of $11,500 is a reasonable compromise, considering he's willing to meet me close to my previous offer. Since the product is worth $15,000 to him, I believe I'm still getting a good deal. Accepting this offer will also ensure that the sale goes through, rather than risking further negotiation or potentially selling to John for a lower price of $8,000."
