"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, reject it and make a counteroffer, or buy from John.

Alice is offering the product for $150, which exceeds both:
1. The value of the product to me ($120)
2. John's alternative price ($120)

Since I wouldn't profit from buying at $150 (it would actually cost me $30 more than the product is worth to me), and I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $120, Alice's offer doesn't make economic sense.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since John is willing to sell me the product for $120, that sets my maximum price. However, I should try to get a better deal from Alice if possible.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has lowered her offer to $140, but this is still more than:
1. The value of the product to me ($120)
2. John's alternative price ($120)

There's no reason for me to accept an offer that's higher than both my valuation of the product and the alternative option. I should either make another counteroffer or go with John's option.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $110}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer is $130, which is:
1. Higher than the value of the product to me ($120)
2. Higher than John's price ($120)

Since John is offering the same product for $120, which is also equal to my maximum valuation, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $130 or continue negotiating.
