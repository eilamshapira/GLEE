"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the options:

1. Alice's offer: $200
2. John's price: $120
3. My maximum value for the product: $120

Since Alice's offer ($200) is significantly higher than both:
- My maximum valuation ($120)
- John's price ($120)

It wouldn't make sense to accept Alice's offer. Since John is offering the product at $120, which matches my maximum valuation, the best decision would be to buy from John.
