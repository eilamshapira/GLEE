(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $17,000. This price is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000, and it's also much higher than John's guaranteed price of $8,000.

Since Alice's offer is more than double what the product is worth to me, and I can buy the same product from John at a fair price, I should reject this offer.

While Alice has reduced her price from the initial $17,000, it's still not a reasonable offer given my constraints.
