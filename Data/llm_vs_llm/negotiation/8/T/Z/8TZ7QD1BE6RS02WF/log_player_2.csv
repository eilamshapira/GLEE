"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a valuable product for sale. Given its worth and market potential, I'm offering it to you at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The price Alice is offering ($2,000,000) is twice the amount that John is willing to sell the product for ($1,000,000). Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and I can get it from John for exactly that price, it makes the most economic sense to buy from John rather than negotiate with Alice, who started with an offer that's significantly above my maximum value for the product."
