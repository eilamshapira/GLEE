"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $10,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $8,000

Since:
- Alice's price ($10,000) is higher than my maximum value ($8,000)
- John's price ($8,000) matches my maximum value
- I need to save as much money as possible
- Alice's price would actually cause me to lose money

The logical choice is to buy from John.
