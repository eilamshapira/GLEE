"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Based on the information provided:

- The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to you
- Alice is offering to sell it for $1,200,000
- John is willing to sell the same product for $1,000,000

It doesn't make sense to pay $1,200,000 for something that's worth at most $1,000,000 to you, especially when there's an alternative option at $1,000,000.
