"Bob, I'm excited you're interested in this truly unique product. It's irreplaceable and will provide immense value. Given its rare qualities and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $1800000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints and the current market conditions, I think a more reasonable price would be $800000. I understand the product's value, but I also need to consider my financial limits. Let's work towards finding a middle ground that benefits both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $800000 is far below the product's actual worth. However, I value your interest. Let's meet closer to the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This is a significant reduction and a testament to my willingness to work with you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still quite high. I'm ready to increase my offer to $900000. This is a significant step up from my initial offer and shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's continue to work towards a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I acknowledge your increased offer. How about we try for a more modest jump on my side as well? Let's settle at $1450000. This represents a substantial compromise from my initial price and I believe it more accurately reflects the product's unique value proposition.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're making an effort to meet me in the middle, and I appreciate that. However, $1450000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $950000. This is a considerable increase from my previous offers, and I hope it shows my genuine interest in acquiring the product. Let's keep working towards a deal that satisfies both parties.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, We are getting closer, but I still can't go that low. I am willing to reduce the price to $1300000. This is my best offer yet and I believe it is a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
