"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I hope this finds you well. I'm offering you an excellent opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its high market value and unique features, I'm offering it to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth, and it will provide you with significant value. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than John's price of $1,500,000, so it's a better deal than buying from John.
* However, Alice values the product at $1,200,000. There's a good chance she might be willing to go lower, saving you even more money."
