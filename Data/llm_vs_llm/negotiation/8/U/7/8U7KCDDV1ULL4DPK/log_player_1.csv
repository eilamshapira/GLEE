Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze this situation:

- My product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me
- Bob values it at $800,000
- If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for $1,500,000 guaranteed

Since Bob values the product at $800,000, he won't pay more than that. And since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, which is also my minimum acceptable value, there's no reason for me to offer Bob a price below $1,500,000.

Given that Bob won't accept a price above his valuation and I won't accept a price below mine, this deal with Bob isn't viable.
