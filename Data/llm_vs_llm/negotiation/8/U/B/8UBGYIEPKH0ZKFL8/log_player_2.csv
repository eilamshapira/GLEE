"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $1,500,000
3. John is also selling it for $1,500,000
4. If I reject Alice's offer without buying from John, I won't get the product

Since Alice's offer is at my maximum value ($1,500,000) and it's the same as John's price, I have no advantage in choosing one over the other. However, since I need the product and both options cost the same, I might as well accept Alice's offer since she's already here.
