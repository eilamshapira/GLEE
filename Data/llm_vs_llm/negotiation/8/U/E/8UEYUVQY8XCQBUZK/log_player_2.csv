"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $13,000 is still quite a bit higher than our ideal budget."

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?"",

```

This offer gives us some room to negotiate upwards while still staying significantly below Alice's initial asking price and our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest, but $8000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go. How about we meet in the middle at $11500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is coming down, $11,500 is still a long way from our ideal price. We're getting close enough to John's price that we need to push Alice a bit more or walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand we both have a price in mind, Alice. To be completely transparent, I can get a similar product elsewhere for $10,000.  To make it worth my while, I could go up to $9,000 for yours. "",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

1. **Transparency:**  We're honestly telling Alice about our alternative option. This can sometimes encourage sellers to be more flexible.
2. **Firmness:** By stating our absolute maximum, we're signaling that we're not willing to budge much further. 
3. **Fairness:**  $9,000 still gives Alice a reasonable profit margin, and it's a significant discount from her original offer. 

Let's see if she bites."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your transparency, Bob. While I understand you can find a similar product for $10000, I'm still looking for a better price. How about $10500 for mine? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is clearly holding out for a higher price, and it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $10,500.  At this point, the potential savings are not worth the continued negotiation. It's time to go with John's offer of $10,000."
