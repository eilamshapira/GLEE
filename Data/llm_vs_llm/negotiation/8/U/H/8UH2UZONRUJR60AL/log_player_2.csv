"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a high-quality product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $12,000 is below my maximum budget of $15,000, I have room to potentially negotiate a better price. However, $12,000 is also a reasonable price, and I don't know if Alice will be willing to lower it further. Given that I have the option to buy from John for $15,000, which is my maximum budget, I'll first try to negotiate with Alice to see if I can get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable, to see if she's willing to negotiate. Since I don't know the minimum price Alice is willing to accept, I'll start by offering a price that is significantly lower than her initial offer, but not so low that it's unrealistic.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
