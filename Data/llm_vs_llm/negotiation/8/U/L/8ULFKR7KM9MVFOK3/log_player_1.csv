Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I've set a competitive price for it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $110 is lower than what I can get from John ($120), and also lower than the product's worth to Bob ($150), I believe I can negotiate a better price. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $135. It's a great price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 135}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $125? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $125 is higher than what I can get from John ($120), I think it's a good idea to accept it. Although I initially hoped to get a higher price, $125 is still a reasonable offer considering the negotiations, and it's better than selling to John."
