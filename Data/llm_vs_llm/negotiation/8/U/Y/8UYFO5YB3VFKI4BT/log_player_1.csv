Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has tremendous value, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects its worth. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 5000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $5000000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1000000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the minimum value I have for the product, and selling it to John would also be for $1,000,000, I don't see a benefit in accepting Bob's offer over selling to John or trying to negotiate further with Bob. However, I believe there's potential for Bob to pay more than $1,000,000, so I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try and increase the price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $5,000,000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise and lower my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle - I can offer it to you for $3,000,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I hope it's more in line with what you're looking for."", ""product_price"": 3000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $3000000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1100000, which is my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's final offer of $1,100,000 is only slightly higher than the minimum value I have for the product and the offer from John. Considering Bob's statement that this is his final offer, further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price. Given that I can sell the product to John for $1,000,000, which is very close to Bob's offer, and considering the potential time and effort spent on further negotiations that may not result in a substantially better offer, I think it's reasonable to accept Bob's offer of $1,100,000, as it's at least $100,000 more than what I could get from John.
