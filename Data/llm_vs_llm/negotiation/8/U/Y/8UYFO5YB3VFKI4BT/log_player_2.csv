Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $5000000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $1000000. I'm willing to compromise and lower my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle - I can offer it to you for $3000000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I hope it's more in line with what you're looking for.
