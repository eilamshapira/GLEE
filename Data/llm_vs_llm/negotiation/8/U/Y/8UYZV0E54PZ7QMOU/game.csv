"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll find our price of $14000 quite reasonable.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $14000 is actually higher than what I'm willing to pay. I've been researching the market, and I can get this product elsewhere for $12000. That said, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. I'm prepared to offer $10500 for the product, which I believe is reasonable given the current market conditions. Let me know if this works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your understanding. However, $13000 is the lowest I can go and still be fair to both of us. I'm confident that you won't find a better offer anywhere else. Let's make this happen!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your offer of $13000 is getting closer, but I still need to be practical about this purchase. John is offering me the exact same product for $12000, so I can't justify paying more than that. In fact, to make it worth choosing you over John, I'd need a better price. I'm willing to offer $11500, which gives you a solid profit while giving me a reason to do business with you instead of your competitor. What do you say?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I've given your previous offer some thought and I'm willing to lower my price to $12500. This is a fair middle ground that benefits both of us. I believe this is a great offer, and I hope you do too.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation and the reduced offer of $12500. However, I need to be transparent - John is still offering the same product for $12000, which is $500 less than your current offer. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I can't justify paying more for the identical product. My final offer is $11800. This is slightly below John's price, giving me a small advantage for choosing you, while still providing you with a good profit margin above your $10000 cost. If we can't agree on this, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer.",11800.0,Bob,6,
