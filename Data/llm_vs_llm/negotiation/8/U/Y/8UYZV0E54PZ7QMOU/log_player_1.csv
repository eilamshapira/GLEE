Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $14000 is actually higher than what I'm willing to pay. I've been researching the market, and I can get this product elsewhere for $12000. That said, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. I'm prepared to offer $10500 for the product, which I believe is reasonable given the current market conditions. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

# My counteroffer to Bob:
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Given the product's quality and the excellent service we provide, I believe $13,000 is a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your understanding. However, $13,000 is the lowest I can go and still be fair to both of us. I'm confident that you won't find a better offer anywhere else. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your offer of $13000 is getting closer, but I still need to be practical about this purchase. John is offering me the exact same product for $12000, so I can't justify paying more than that. In fact, to make it worth choosing you over John, I'd need a better price. I'm willing to offer $11500, which gives you a solid profit while giving me a reason to do business with you instead of your competitor. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

# My counteroffer to Bob:
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, and I want to work with you. However, $11,500 is still too low for me to accept. Let's meet in the middle at $12,500. This price ensures that both of us walk away with a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I've given your previous offer some thought and I'm willing to lower my price to $12,500. This is a fair middle ground that benefits both of us. I believe this is a great offer, and I hope you do too."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation and the reduced offer of $12500. However, I need to be transparent - John is still offering the same product for $12000, which is $500 less than your current offer. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I can't justify paying more for the identical product. My final offer is $11800. This is slightly below John's price, giving me a small advantage for choosing you, while still providing you with a good profit margin above your $10000 cost. If we can't agree on this, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
