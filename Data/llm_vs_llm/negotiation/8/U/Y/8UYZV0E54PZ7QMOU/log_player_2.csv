"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll find our price of $14000 quite reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to consider this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $14,000, which is actually higher than what I'd pay to John ($12,000), and also higher than the maximum value of $12,000 that the product is worth to me.

Since John is willing to sell me the product for $12,000, and Alice's current offer exceeds that price, it doesn't make sense to accept Alice's offer. However, I'll reject it and make a counteroffer rather than immediately going to John, as I might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $14,000 is actually higher than what I'm willing to pay. I've been researching the market, and I can get this product elsewhere for $12,000. That said, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can agree on a fair price. I'm prepared to offer $10,500 for the product, which I believe is reasonable given the current market conditions. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your understanding. However, $13000 is the lowest I can go and still be fair to both of us. I'm confident that you won't find a better offer anywhere else. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price to $13,000, which shows some willingness to negotiate. However, this price is still higher than both John's offer ($12,000) and what the product is worth to me (also $12,000 maximum).

Since I can get the same product from John for $12,000, and Alice's current offer still exceeds that, I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer. If I can get Alice to come down below $12,000, that would be ideal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Your offer of $13,000 is getting closer, but I still need to be practical about this purchase. John is offering me the exact same product for $12,000, so I can't justify paying more than that. In fact, to make it worth choosing you over John, I'd need a better price. I'm willing to offer $11,500, which gives you a solid profit while giving me a reason to do business with you instead of your competitor. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I've given your previous offer some thought and I'm willing to lower my price to $12500. This is a fair middle ground that benefits both of us. I believe this is a great offer, and I hope you do too. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has now offered the product for $12,500, which is still higher than John's price of $12,000. Since John's offer is lower and still within my maximum value for the product, it doesn't make economic sense to accept Alice's current offer.

I'll make one more attempt to negotiate with Alice before potentially going with John's offer.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation and the reduced offer of $12,500. However, I need to be transparent - John is still offering the same product for $12,000, which is $500 less than your current offer. While I'd prefer to do business with you, I can't justify paying more for the identical product. My final offer is $11,800. This is slightly below John's price, giving me a small advantage for choosing you, while still providing you with a good profit margin above your $10,000 cost. If we can't agree on this, I'll unfortunately need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 11800}"
