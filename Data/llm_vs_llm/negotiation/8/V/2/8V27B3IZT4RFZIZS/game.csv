"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is significantly above my budget. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer you $650000 for the product, which would allow me to stay within my budget while still giving you a reasonable profit.",650000.0,Bob,2,
