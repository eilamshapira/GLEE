Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a unique opportunity, and I must mention that this offer is only available for a limited negotiation period. Please let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is significantly above my budget. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer you $650000 for the product, which would allow me to stay within my budget while still giving you a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
