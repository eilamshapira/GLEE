"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. This is a unique opportunity, and I must mention that this offer is only available for a limited negotiation period. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer is the product's full value to her and is much higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. Since John is offering exactly $800,000, which is my maximum budget, I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer that could potentially save me money.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I should mention that I have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for $800,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer you $650,000 for the product, which would allow me to stay within my budget while still giving you a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
