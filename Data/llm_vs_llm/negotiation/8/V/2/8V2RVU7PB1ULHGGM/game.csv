"Thank you for considering my counteroffer, Alice. Based on my budget and the market research I've done, I'd like to offer $4000 for the product. I believe this price point reflects its value more accurately.",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $4000 is significantly below the product's value. I have a standing offer from another buyer for $15000, which is my absolute minimum price. However, I'm willing to work with you and can offer the product for $16000, which is lower than my initial offer. This is still a fair price given the product's quality and market value.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"After reevaluating my budget and the product's market value, I'd like to offer $5000 for the product. I believe this price point is more feasible for me and hope we can reach an agreement.",5000.0,Bob,4,
