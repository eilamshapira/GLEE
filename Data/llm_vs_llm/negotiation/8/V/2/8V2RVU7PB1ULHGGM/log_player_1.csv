"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer, Alice. Based on my budget and the market research I've done, I'd like to offer $4000 for the product. I believe this price point reflects its value more accurately. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $4,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will make a new counteroffer in the next round, but if we cannot come closer to a reasonable price, I will consider selling to John instead."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $4,000 is significantly below the product's value. I have a standing offer from another buyer for $15,000, which is my absolute minimum price. However, I'm willing to work with you and can offer the product for $16,000, which is lower than my initial offer. This is still a fair price given the product's quality and market value."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: After reevaluating my budget and the product's market value, I'd like to offer $5000 for the product. I believe this price point is more feasible for me and hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've decided to sell to John for $15,000. Bob's offers are consistently well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and his small increase from $4,000 to $5,000 suggests we're unlikely to reach an acceptable price point. Since the product is worth no less than $15,000 to me, and John is willing to pay exactly that amount, it makes the most business sense to conclude the deal with John rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to be fruitful."
