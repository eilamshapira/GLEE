Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $4000 is significantly below the product's value. I have a standing offer from another buyer for $15000, which is my absolute minimum price. However, I'm willing to work with you and can offer the product for $16000, which is lower than my initial offer. This is still a fair price given the product's quality and market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I'm going to make another counteroffer that I believe is more reasonable."
