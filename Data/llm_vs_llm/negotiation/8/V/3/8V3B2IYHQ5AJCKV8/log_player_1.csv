Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'd like to start the negotiation with a price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer that I believe is more reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $8,000 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer to see if we can meet at a mutually agreeable price. 

My counteroffer is: $18,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20,000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'd like to offer a lower price, but still reflective of the product's value."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $10,000 matches the minimum price I'm willing to accept and also matches the price John is willing to pay, I might as well accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $10,000. This way, I'm still getting a fair price, and Bob gets the product he's interested in."
