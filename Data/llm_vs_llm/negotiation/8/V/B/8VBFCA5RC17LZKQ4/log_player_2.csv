"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since the product is only worth $10,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $15,000 (which would result in a $5,000 loss of value for me), the rational choice would be to buy from John at $10,000. John's price matches my maximum valuation of the product.
