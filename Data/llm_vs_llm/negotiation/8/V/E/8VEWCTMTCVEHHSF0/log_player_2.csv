"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer at $120
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $100

Since:
- The product is worth no more than $100 to me
- Alice's offer ($120) is above my maximum value
- John's price ($100) matches my maximum value
- My goal is to save as much money as possible

The logical choice would be to buy from John at $100, as it saves me $20 compared to Alice's offer and matches my maximum valuation.
