"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I’m excited to present you with a unique opportunity. I’m offering my exclusive product for $2500000—a special rate that I believe reflects its outstanding value. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $2,500,000 (which is 2.5 times more than my maximum value)
3. John is offering the same product for $1,000,000

The rational decision is to buy from John. Even if I try to negotiate with Alice by making a counteroffer, it would be unlikely to get her to reduce the price by more than 60% from her initial offer to match or beat John's price. Plus, there's no guarantee that further negotiations would be successful, and I could end up wasting time.
