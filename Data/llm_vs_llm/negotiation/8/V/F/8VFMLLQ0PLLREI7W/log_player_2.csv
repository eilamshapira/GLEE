"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for sale. It's a great item, and I think you'll be very happy with it. I'm asking for $10000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $10,000
3. John's fixed price is $12,000

Alice's offer at $10,000 is $2,000 less than John's price and below my maximum value. This is a good deal as it saves me money compared to buying from John.
