"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe the product could be a great fit for me at a lower price point. I'm willing to offer $1100000 for it. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $1100000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product's quality and market value justify a higher price. However, I'm willing to adjust my initial offer. I can offer it for $1350000, which still provides you with significant value given the product's worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1200000. This is the highest I can go while still making the investment worthwhile for me. Let me know if this works for you.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, and I understand your budget concerns. However, given the product's significant value and potential return on investment for you, I believe we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my price further to $1300000. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and would still be a profitable investment for you.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
