Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be a great investment for you.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe the product could be a great fit for me at a lower price point. I'm willing to offer $1100000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: I will reject Bob's offer of $1,100,000 because:
1. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000
2. It's even below John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000
3. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, there's still room for negotiation to reach a better price
I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round, slightly lower than my initial offer but still well above my minimum price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1200000. This is the highest I can go while still making the investment worthwhile for me. Let me know if this works for you.

Reasoning: I'll reject Bob's offer of $1,200,000 because:
1. While it matches John's guaranteed offer, we know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob
2. Bob has already shown willingness to increase his offer from $1,100,000 to $1,200,000
3. Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, there's still significant room for negotiation
4. Even if negotiations fail, I can still sell to John for the same price
I'll make another counteroffer, lowering the price somewhat but still maintaining a good margin above $1,200,000."
