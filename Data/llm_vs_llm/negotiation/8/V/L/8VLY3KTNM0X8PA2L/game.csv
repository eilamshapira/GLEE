"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. It's a high-quality item that I'm offering for $9500. This represents good value considering the product's worth and capabilities. Would you like to purchase it at this price?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, $9500 is a bit steep for me. The market value for similar products is lower, and I'd be willing to purchase it for $8300. This still provides you with a good profit margin while giving me a reasonable price. What do you think?",8300.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a better price, but $8300 is too close to my minimum acceptable price. This product has significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I can come down to $9200, which represents a meaningful discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value to you. Does this work for your budget?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that, but I'm still finding $9200 more than I was hoping to spend. I know this product is valuable, but I have budget constraints to consider. I can offer $8700, which gives you a solid profit while meeting my budget requirements. This is a fair price that works for both of us. What do you say?",8700.0,Bob,4,
