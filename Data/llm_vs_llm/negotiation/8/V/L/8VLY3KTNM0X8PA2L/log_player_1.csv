Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, $9500 is a bit steep for me. The market value for similar products is lower, and I'd be willing to purchase it for $8300. This still provides you with a good profit margin while giving me a reasonable price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

I understand you're looking for a better price, but $8,300 is too close to my minimum acceptable price. This product has significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that, but I'm still finding $9200 more than I was hoping to spend. I know this product is valuable, but I have budget constraints to consider. I can offer $8700, which gives you a solid profit while meeting my budget requirements. This is a fair price that works for both of us. What do you say?
