"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. It's a high-quality item that I'm offering for $9500. This represents good value considering the product's worth and capabilities. Would you like to purchase it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice is offering the product for $9,500, which is below my maximum value of $10,000, but still quite high considering it's only worth $8,000 to her.

If I accept, I save $500 compared to buying from John, but I might be able to negotiate a better deal.

If I buy from John immediately, I'd be paying $10,000, which doesn't make sense when Alice is already offering a lower price.

The best approach is to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

The market value for similar products is lower, and I'd be willing to purchase it for $8,300. This still provides you with a good profit margin while giving me a reasonable price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8300}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a better price, but $8300 is too close to my minimum acceptable price. This product has significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I can come down to $9200, which represents a meaningful discount from my initial offer while still reflecting the product's true value to you. Does this work for your budget? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has lowered her price to $9,200, which is a $300 reduction from her initial offer. This is still well above her cost of $8,000, and I believe there's room for further negotiation. Since John's offer of $10,000 remains higher than Alice's current offer, and I still have room to negotiate, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate that, but I'm still finding $9,200 more than I was hoping to spend. I know this product is valuable, but I have budget constraints to consider. I can offer $8,700, which gives you a solid profit while meeting my budget requirements. This is a fair price that works for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8700}"
