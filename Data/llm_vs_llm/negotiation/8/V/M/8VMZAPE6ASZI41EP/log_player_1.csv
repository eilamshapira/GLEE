Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic offer to Bob, considering that my product is worth at least $120 to me, and I can sell it to John for exactly $120 if Bob rejects my offer.

Since the product is only worth $100 to Bob, any price above $100 would lead to rejection, as Bob wouldn't pay more than the product's value to him. At the same time, I shouldn't offer less than $120, as I can already get that amount from John.

Given these constraints, my best move is to sell to John instead of Bob.
