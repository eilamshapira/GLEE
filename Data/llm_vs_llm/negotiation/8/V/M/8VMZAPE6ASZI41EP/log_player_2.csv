"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $120. While I understand this may be above your typical budget, this particular item has special value and I cannot go lower than this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to carefully consider this offer compared to my alternatives:

- Alice is offering the product for $120
- I value the product at no more than $100
- John is willing to sell me the same product for $100

Since Alice's price ($120) exceeds both my maximum valuation ($100) and John's alternative price ($100), the most rational decision is to reject Alice's offer and purchase from John instead. This allows me to save $20 while still obtaining the product.
