"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to evaluate the given options carefully.

Alice is offering the product for $11,500, while John is selling it for $12,000.

Since the product is worth up to $12,000 to me, and Alice's offer ($11,500) is $500 less than John's price ($12,000), it would be financially better for me to accept Alice's offer.

By accepting Alice's offer, I save $500 compared to buying from John.
