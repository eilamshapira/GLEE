# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. What do you think?

Considering my minimum acceptable price is $800,000, and Bob's offer is $900,000, I have to weigh the potential for a higher price against the risk of losing the sale entirely.

I'm going to **Reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.** I believe I can get a slightly higher price.

This is getting closer to my ideal price. While I'd prefer more, $950,000 is still significantly above my minimum of $800,000. I need to consider the risk of pushing too hard and losing the sale entirely. There are still several rounds left, but I don't want to get greedy.
