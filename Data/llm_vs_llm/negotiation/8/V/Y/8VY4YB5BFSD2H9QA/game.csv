"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and lower the price, but I need to get closer to the product's value. Let me make you a new offer.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the new offer. I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $130 is still above what I'm willing to pay. Considering we're getting close, I'm willing to meet you almost at the middle point between your offer and my target price. I can do $100 for the product, which is the most I'm willing to pay.",100.0,Bob,8,
