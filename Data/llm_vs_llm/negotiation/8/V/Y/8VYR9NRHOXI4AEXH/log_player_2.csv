"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Given that Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's price ($1,200,000), and this is also the maximum value I'm willing to pay, there's no advantage in accepting Alice's offer over buying from John. However, by rejecting Alice's offer, I can make a counteroffer that might result in a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a significantly lower offer to leave room for negotiation while trying to get a better price than John's $1,200,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price to $1,150,000, which is $50,000 less than John's price. This is a good improvement from the initial offer. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might increase her price again or become unwilling to negotiate. Since I'm already saving $50,000 compared to John's price, I'll accept this offer.
