"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer is $1,450,000
2. John's fixed price is $1,500,000
3. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice
4. I have a maximum budget of $1,500,000
5. We have 10 rounds total

Alice's initial offer of $1,450,000 is high, and only $50,000 less than John's price. Since Alice's cost is $1,200,000, there's significant room for negotiation. With 10 rounds available, it's worth trying to negotiate for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, I'll make a counteroffer that's above her cost but significantly below her initial offer. I'll start with a price that's about halfway between her cost and her initial offer.

{""product_price"": 1,300,000}

This offer gives Alice a $100,000 profit while saving me $150,000 compared to her initial offer. It's a reasonable starting point that leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
