"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its rarity and potential value to you, I'm initially pricing it at $15000. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8000, considering the market value and my budget. Looking forward to your response.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate you engaging with me. While $8000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $14000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down from the initial price. However, $14000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new price. How about $10500? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"That's a good move, Bob. I see you're serious about this. Let's try $13000.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, $13000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering I can get a similar product from John for $10000, I'm willing to offer $11000. This is my highest offer so far, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Okay, Bob, you drive a hard bargain. I'm willing to come down a little more. Let's try $12500.",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12500 is still above my budget. Since we're running out of rounds, I'll make a serious offer. I'll meet you in the middle between my previous offer and your new price. That would be $11750. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options, like buying from John for $10000.",11750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Alright Bob, this is getting close. I'll come down to $12000. That's the lowest I can go.",12000.0,Alice,9,
