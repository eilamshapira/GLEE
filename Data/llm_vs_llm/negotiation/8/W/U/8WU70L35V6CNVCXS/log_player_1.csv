Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the quality and durability of the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $80, considering my budget and the prices I've seen elsewhere. I believe this is a reasonable price, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget concerns, but I need to be clear that $80 is well below what I can accept for this item. The product's value to me is no less than $120, which is actually the price another buyer, John, is ready to pay right now. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can offer you the product for $125, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer while still being fair considering its quality and value."", ""product_price"": 125}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you, Alice, for your willingness to negotiate and for the new offer of $125. I understand that $80 was a bit low, and I appreciate your transparency about the product's value. However, $125 is still a bit out of my budget. Considering John is offering the same product for $100, I was thinking we could meet in the middle. I'd like to propose $95 as a counteroffer. This way, you're getting closer to your desired price, and I'm staying within my budget.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I think there might be some confusion. John isn't offering to sell me the product for $100 - John is a different buyer who is offering to purchase this product from me for $120. I appreciate your revised offer of $95, but I can't accept less than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which matches what I could get from John, but that's as low as I can go. This is the bottom line for me, and I hope you understand my position."", ""product_price"": 120}"
