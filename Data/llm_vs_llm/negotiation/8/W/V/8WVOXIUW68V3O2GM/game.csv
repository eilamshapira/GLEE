"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I'd like to make a counteroffer. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $8000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is too low for this product. Considering its true value, I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to its worth. How about $16000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down from the original price, but $16000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in finding a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about we meet closer to the middle, and I'll pay $9000 for the product?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $14000. This is a fantastic product, and I believe this is a fair price.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price again. However, $14000 is still higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm starting to think that we might not be able to meet in the middle. That being said, I'm willing to make one more attempt. I'll offer $9500 for the product, which is the highest I'm willing to go at this point.",9500.0,Bob,6,
