"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for the first round:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this exceptional product. Considering its unique features and value, I'm offering it to you for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I'd like to make a counteroffer. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $8000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough spot. Bob's counteroffer is significantly below my minimum price of $10,000.

I have to consider the potential for future negotiations, but I also have to protect my floor.

Given the current offer, I will **RejectOffer** and try to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is too low for this product. Considering its true value, I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to its worth. How about $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down from the original price, but $16000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in finding a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about we meet closer to the middle, and I'll pay $9000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is still below my minimum, and I'm getting close to the point where I need to cut my losses. I could potentially get more from him, but the offers are not promising.

Given this is the 4th round, and I still have a chance to negotiate, I'll try one more counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, here's my counteroffer, trying to find some common ground:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $14,000. This is a fantastic product, and I believe this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price again. However, $14000 is still higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm starting to think that we might not be able to meet in the middle. That being said, I'm willing to make one more attempt. I'll offer $9500 for the product, which is the highest I'm willing to go at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a critical moment. Bob is inching closer to my minimum, but still below. I've made several counteroffers and haven't moved the needle much. I'm nearing the point where I need to secure at least $10,000 to make this worthwhile.

I need to seriously consider selling to John. Given that it is the 6th round, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum, it is time to cut my losses.
