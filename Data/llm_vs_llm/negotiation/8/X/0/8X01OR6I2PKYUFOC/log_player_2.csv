"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you this product for $200. If you’re interested, let me know—otherwise, I’ll be selling it to another buyer for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice's offer is $200, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. Additionally, Alice mentioned that she would sell it to another buyer for $120, which is still above my budget, but it gives me an idea that the product might be available for less than $200. However, my best option at this point, considering my budget constraint, is to buy the product from John for $100, as it fits within my budget of $100.
