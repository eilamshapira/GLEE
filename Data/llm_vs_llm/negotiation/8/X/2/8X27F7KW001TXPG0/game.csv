"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe $1800000 is above my budget. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900000. I think this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure a fair return on this product. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1600000, which is a considerable reduction and represents good value given the product's quality and market position.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price, but $1600000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. I've thought about the product's value, and I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $1050000. I believe this is a reasonable price, considering the product's worth to me, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
