"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be beneficial for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential value."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe $1800000 is above my budget. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900000. I think this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below even his own valuation of $1,200,000, and it's well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We still have several rounds to negotiate, so I'll continue by making a more reasonable counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly below the product's value. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure a fair return on this product. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1,600,000, which is a considerable reduction and represents good value given the product's quality and market position."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price, but $1600000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. I've thought about the product's value, and I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $1050000. I believe this is a reasonable price, considering the product's worth to me, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John. Bob's latest offer of $1,050,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and given that I know the product is only worth $1,200,000 to Bob, it's unlikely he'll ever offer more than that. Since John is willing to pay $1,500,000, which matches my minimum acceptable price and is significantly better than what Bob is likely to offer, it's in my best interest to take John's guaranteed offer now rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to reach my target price."
