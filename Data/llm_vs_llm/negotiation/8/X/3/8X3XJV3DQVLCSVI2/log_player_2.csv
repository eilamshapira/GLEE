"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'll reject Alice's offer of $11,500 since it's quite high and close to John's price of $12,000. Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her cost, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle.

{""product_price"": 10500}

This offer gives Alice a $500 profit while still saving me a significant amount compared to both her initial offer and John's price."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price by $250 from her initial offer, showing some willingness to negotiate. However, there's still room for a better deal since we know her cost is $10,000. I'll reject this offer and try another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down to $11,250 from $11,500, I'll increase my previous offer to show willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a good deal.

{""product_price"": 10800}

This offer gives Alice an $800 profit while still being significantly better than her offer of $11,250. It shows I'm willing to move up from my previous offer of $10,500, which should help keep the negotiation moving in a positive direction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a significant reduction from her initial offer of $11,500. While we might be able to negotiate further, we're already half-way through our rounds, and this price gives us a good $1,000 savings compared to John's offer. The risk of continuing negotiation might not be worth the potential additional savings, as Alice might become less flexible in later rounds.
