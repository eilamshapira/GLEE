"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $100 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know that John is selling the same product for $80, but I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider selling it for $65? This would be a good deal for both of us.",65.0,Bob,2,
