"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $100 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know that John is selling the same product for $80, but I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider selling it for $65? This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
