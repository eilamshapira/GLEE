"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. Please let me know if you're interested in buying at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Based on the information provided, Alice's offer is for $100, which is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($80). Since John is offering the exact same product for $80, which is within my budget constraint, it would be more economical for me to buy from John.

However, I could also try to negotiate with Alice to see if she would lower her price below $80. Since we have 10 rounds of negotiation available, it might be worth trying at least one counteroffer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $100 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I know that John is selling the same product for $80, but I'd prefer to buy from you if we can reach a fair price. Would you consider selling it for $65? This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 65}"
