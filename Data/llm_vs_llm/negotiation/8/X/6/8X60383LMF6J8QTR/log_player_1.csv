"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start by making a relatively high offer to maximize my potential earnings. I can always adjust my price later based on Bob's response.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer is at the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($8,000), and I also have the option to sell it to John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Bob's offer at this point. I'd like to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $8,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, my counteroffer will be slightly higher. I'll try to find a middle ground that's still attractive to Bob, but also closer to my initial offer.
