"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $2000000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1000000 for the product. Please let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand that $2000000 might be a stretch, but I believe the value of the product is substantially higher than $1000000. Let's meet in the middle. How does $1500000 sound? It's a fair price considering the quality and potential benefits you'll be getting.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1500000 is closer, it's still above what I'm prepared to spend. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000. This is my final offer before considering other options. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
