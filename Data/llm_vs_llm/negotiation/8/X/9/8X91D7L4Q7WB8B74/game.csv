"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $110 is a bit steep. Given the market conditions, I think $90 would be a fair price for both of us. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me. What do you say?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and the discussion. I understand your perspective on the price.  I can't go as low as $90, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $100? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. You're moving in the right direction, and I can see we're getting closer to an agreement. How about we meet in the middle at $95? This gives you a solid profit while being a fair price for me. I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",95.0,Bob,4,
