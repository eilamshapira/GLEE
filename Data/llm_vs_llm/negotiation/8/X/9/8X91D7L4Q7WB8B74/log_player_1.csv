Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $110 is a bit steep. Given the market conditions, I think $90 would be a fair price for both of us. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
