"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this strategically:
1. The product is worth no more than $120 to me (my maximum value)
2. Alice's cost is $80 (her minimum value)
3. John offers $120 (my fallback option)
4. Alice's offer of $110 is better than John's $120, but there's room for negotiation since Alice's cost is $80

Alice's opening offer of $110 is high considering her $80 cost. Since we have 10 rounds of negotiation available, I should try to negotiate for a better price. The worst case is still buying from John at $120, so I have nothing to lose by negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's above Alice's cost but significantly below her initial offer.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $110 is a bit steep. Given the market conditions, I think $90 would be a fair price for both of us. This would still give you a good profit margin while being more reasonable for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and the discussion. I understand your perspective on the price.  I can't go as low as $90, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $100? That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze this new offer:
1. Alice has come down from $110 to $100, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This is a $20 markup from her cost ($80)
3. It's $20 less than John's price ($120)
4. We still have 7 more potential rounds of negotiation
5. The price movement is in my favor ($110 â†’ $100)

While $100 is better than the initial offer and certainly better than John's price, there might still be room for a bit more negotiation. Given the price movement pattern and that we're not pressed for time yet, I'll try one more counter.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. You're moving in the right direction, and I can see we're getting closer to an agreement. How about we meet in the middle at $95? This gives you a solid profit while being a fair price for me. I'm ready to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 95}"
