"Round 1

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $13,000 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($12,000), but still relatively low, I'll choose to reject his offer and make a counteroffer. This will give me a chance to negotiate a higher price.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. This will show that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more.
