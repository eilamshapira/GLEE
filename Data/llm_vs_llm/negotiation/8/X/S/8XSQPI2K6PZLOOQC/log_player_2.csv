"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I'm offering exclusively to you before making it available to other interested parties. This product has significant value, and I believe it could be a great opportunity for you. I'm willing to offer it at a competitive price of $2300000. This is a premium offering with substantial potential returns. I do have another buyer, John, who has expressed interest, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity. Would you like to proceed with this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $2,300,000, which is more than my maximum budget, I will reject Alice's offer. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within my budget.
