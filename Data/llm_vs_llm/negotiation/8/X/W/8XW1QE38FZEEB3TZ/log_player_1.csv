Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I'm working with a more limited budget. Similar products are available in the market for much less. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, which I believe is fair given current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
