"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a top-tier product that guarantees exceptional value. I believe you'll find it meets your needs perfectly. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'll analyze the situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
2. Alice's offer is $15,000, which is $3,000 above my maximum value
3. John is offering the product for $12,000, which is exactly my maximum value
4. Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum value
5. While I could try to negotiate with Alice, there's no guarantee she'll go below $12,000

Since Alice's offer is well above my maximum value ($12,000), and we have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $12,000, I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. This gives us a chance to potentially get a better deal than John's price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still reasonable:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I'm working with a more limited budget. Similar products are available in the market for much less. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,000, which I believe is fair given current market conditions."", ""product_price"": 10000}

This counteroffer is strategic because:
1. It's below my maximum value of $12,000, giving room for negotiation
2. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $15,000
3. It provides justification for the lower price by referencing market conditions
4. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate up while staying under $12,000
5. We always have John's offer of $12,000 as a backup"
