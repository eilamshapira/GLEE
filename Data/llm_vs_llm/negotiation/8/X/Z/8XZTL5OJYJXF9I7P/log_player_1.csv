"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $750,000 is lower than my minimum acceptable price and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

My counteroffer to Bob will be $1,200,000, which is still below what the product is worth to him but higher than my previous offer, trying to meet in the middle.

However, according to the format, my decision for this round is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to what I can get from John ($1,000,000) and is higher than my previous counteroffer, I will consider it carefully. However, it's still slightly lower than what I was hoping to get from Bob, given that the product is worth $1,500,000 to him.

Given the options, I think I can try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, but I also don't want to risk losing the sale. Since Bob's offer is so close to my fallback option with John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a bit more.

My next counteroffer will be $1,000,000, matching what John is willing to pay, to see if Bob is willing to meet me at that price.

However, according to the format, my decision for this round is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000}"
