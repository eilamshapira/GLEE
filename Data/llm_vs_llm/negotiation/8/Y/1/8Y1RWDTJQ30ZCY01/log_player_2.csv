"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($12,000), and buying from John would cost the same, I might as well reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price. If the negotiation doesn't work out, I can still buy from John for $12,000.
