Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine an appropriate price to offer Bob for the product. I know the product is worth at least $100 to me, and if Bob rejects my offer, I can sell it to John for $100.

Since I want to maximize my earnings and have a guaranteed $100 from John as my fallback, I should offer Bob a price higher than $100. However, if I set the price too high, Bob might reject it.

Without knowing Bob's valuation, I'll choose a moderate markup that gives me a good profit while still having a reasonable chance of acceptance.
