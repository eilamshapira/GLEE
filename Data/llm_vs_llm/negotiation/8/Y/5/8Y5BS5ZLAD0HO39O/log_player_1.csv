Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $120 to Bob
2. The product is worth at least $80 to me
3. If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $80 from John
4. Bob will likely reject if the price is too close to $120

I should offer a price that's high enough to give me good profit but low enough that Bob still sees value. A price around $100 would give Bob $20 in surplus value while giving me $20 more than my fallback option with John.
