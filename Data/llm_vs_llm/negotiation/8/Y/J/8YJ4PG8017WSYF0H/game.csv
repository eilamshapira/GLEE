"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it for $25000. This product is high quality and worth the investment. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25000 is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $5000 for the product.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $5000 is significantly below the product's value. This product is worth at least $15000 to me, and I have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can offer it for $22000, which is already a reduction from my initial price. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, $22000 is still too high for me. My absolute maximum is $7000.  I'm happy to buy it for that price if you agree, but I'm also considering other options.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your increased offer. However, $7000 is still well below what this product is worth. I have another buyer ready to pay $15000, which reflects the true minimum value of this product. I'm willing to offer you a better deal at $19000, which is a significant discount from my initial price. This is a quality product that will provide excellent value at this price point. Can we reach an agreement here?",19000.0,Alice,5,
