Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $5000 is significantly below the product's value. This product is worth at least $15000 to me, and I have another buyer willing to pay that amount. However, I'd like to work with you if possible. I can offer it for $22000, which is already a reduction from my initial price. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your increased offer. However, $7000 is still well below what this product is worth. I have another buyer ready to pay $15000, which reflects the true minimum value of this product. I'm willing to offer you a better deal at $19000, which is a significant discount from my initial price. This is a quality product that will provide excellent value at this price point. Can we reach an agreement here? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
