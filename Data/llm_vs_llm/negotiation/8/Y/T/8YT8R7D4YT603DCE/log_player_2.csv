# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150

Since Alice's offer is the same price as what John would sell it for, it makes no difference which seller I buy from. I might as well accept Alice's offer."
