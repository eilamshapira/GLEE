"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but my budget is much lower. I'd be willing to pay $5000 for it.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I appreciate your interest, but $5000 is quite low for this product. How about we meet in the middle? I'd be willing to accept $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12000 is still too high for me. I understand you want to get a good price, but my maximum is $6000. That's the most I can justify spending on this.",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, I'm willing to lower my price a bit more. How about $9000? Let's find a way to make this work!",9000.0,Alice,5,
