"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to consider my options here. Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is exactly the maximum value it's worth to me. This is also exactly the same as John's price.

Since Alice's initial offer isn't better than my alternative (buying from John), and I have the opportunity to try negotiating for a better price, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that gives us both room to negotiate.

{""product_price"": $800,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price to $1,000,000, which is $200,000 less than both her initial offer and John's alternative price. This is a significant improvement and represents real savings for me.

While I could try to negotiate further, this offer already saves me a substantial amount, and there's always the risk that Alice could withdraw this offer if I push too hard.
