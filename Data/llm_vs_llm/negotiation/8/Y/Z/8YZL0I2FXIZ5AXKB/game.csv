"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid $950000 is still too low for us to accept. However, we're willing to come down to $1075000 to make this deal happen. It's a fair price that benefits both parties. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a compromise at $990000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",990000.0,Bob,4,
