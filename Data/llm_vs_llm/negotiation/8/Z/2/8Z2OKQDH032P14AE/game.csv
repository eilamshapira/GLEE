"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $120 is quite high for this product. I've done my research, and I can find similar products for much less. I'd be willing to offer $70 for it.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $70 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and quality, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, I know I can get this product elsewhere for $80. To make it worth buying from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer $75 for it.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price. Considering you mentioned you're willing to pay $80 elsewhere, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your target price. I can offer the product to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,5,
