"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth a premium price, and I'm willing to let it go for $120."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $120 is quite high for this product. I've done my research, and I can find similar products for much less. I'd be willing to offer $70 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $70 is lower than what the product is worth to him ($80) and significantly lower than what it's worth to me (at least $100), I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $70 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and quality, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, I know I can get this product elsewhere for $80. To make it worth buying from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer $75 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $75 is still lower than what the product is worth to him ($80) and significantly lower than what it's worth to me (at least $100). Since he mentioned he's willing to pay $80 to get it elsewhere, I believe he might be willing to meet me at a higher price point. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price. Considering you mentioned you're willing to pay $80 elsewhere, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your target price. I can offer the product to you for $105."", ""product_price"": 105}"
