"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth a premium price, and I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me think about this strategically:
1. The product is worth no more than $80 to me
2. Alice's offer of $120 is way above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80)
3. I can either negotiate with Alice or buy from John for $80
4. Since Alice's initial offer is so high, it's worth trying to negotiate first

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's below my maximum value but leaves room for negotiation:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $120 is quite high for this product. I've done my research, and I can find similar products for much less. I'd be willing to offer $70 for it."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $70 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and quality, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Alice reduced her price from $120 to $110, showing she's willing to negotiate
2. However, $110 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($80) and John's price ($80)
3. While Alice is showing flexibility, her current offer is not competitive with John's price
4. Since we have plenty of rounds left and Alice is showing willingness to negotiate, I'll try one more counter

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down $10 from her initial offer, I'll increase my offer a bit but still stay below my maximum value:

{""message"": ""I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. However, I know I can get this product elsewhere for $80. To make it worth buying from you instead, I would need a better price. I can offer $75 for it."", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price. Considering you mentioned you're willing to pay $80 elsewhere, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your target price. I can offer the product to you for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let's evaluate the situation:
1. Alice is still offering well above John's price ($80)
2. She acknowledged my mention of the $80 alternative but still isn't matching it
3. We've gone through several rounds and Alice's price is still $25 above John's
4. Alice seems unwilling to come down to a competitive price
5. Given that we have a guaranteed option to buy at $80 (which is my maximum value anyway), and Alice isn't showing signs of matching this price, it's time to end the negotiation

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}"
