"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll really enjoy. How about you get it for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Alice is offering the product for $150, which is the same price as John, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer. This ensures you get the product at the best possible price without needing to go through the extra step of buying from John."
