"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you think the price is a bit high, but I believe the product's value lies in its uniqueness and quality. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a better price than $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I still need to get a price that reflects the product's value.
