Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. Could we start at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no less than $100 to me, and Bob's offer is exactly $100, I could consider accepting it. However, I also have the option to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob or sell it to John for the same price. Given that I want to earn as much money as I can for the product, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price.

Bob's offer:
