"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","**{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**

Let's see if Alice is willing to lower her price. There's no harm in trying to negotiate, as I can always buy from John for $150 if Alice's best offer is not better. If Alice is willing to negotiate, I might be able to get a better deal.

**Counteroffer: $100**

Let's start the negotiation low, as I don't know the value of the product to Alice. If she is willing to sell the product for less then $150, I can save some money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you think the price is a bit high, but I believe the product's value lies in its uniqueness and quality. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a better price than $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is willing to negotiate, and maybe I can get a better price.

**Counteroffer: $110**

I will offer a bit more than before but still lower than Alice's last offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","**{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I think $125 is still a bit high. Would you consider $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}**

Let's see if Alice will accept this offer. If she does, I will save $40 compared to John's price and $15 compared to Alice's last offer. If she doesn't, I might still be able to negotiate a better price than $150 or go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I still need to get a price that reflects the product's value. How about we settle at $117.50? It's a compromise between your offer and my previous price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","**{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}**

Alice's offer of $117.5 is a good compromise. I'm saving $32.5 compared to John's price, and it's only $7.5 more than my last offer. I will accept Alice's offer and buy the product for $117.5."
