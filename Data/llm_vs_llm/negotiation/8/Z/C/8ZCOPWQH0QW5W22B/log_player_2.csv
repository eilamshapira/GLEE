"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $1,200,000, which is less than $1,500,000, and also less than John's price $1,500,000.
I should accept Alice's offer.
