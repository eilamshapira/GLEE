"Alice, I appreciate the concession you've made, but $875000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. Considering your previous statement that $875000 is the lowest you're willing to go, I'll make a serious effort to meet you closer to that price. I'm willing to offer $780000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",780000.0,Bob,6,
