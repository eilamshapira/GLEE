"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I believe would be valuable to you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $135. This is a fair price considering the product's worth, and it represents good value for both of us. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider my options carefully here:

1. Alice is offering the product for $135
2. John will sell it for $150
3. The product is worth no more than $150 to me

Since Alice's offer of $135 is less than both John's price ($150) and my maximum valuation ($150), accepting Alice's offer would save me $15 compared to buying from John.
