"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know if you're interested!",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $200 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I should mention that I can get the same product from another seller for $150. I'd like to buy from you though, so I'm willing to offer $120 for it. This gives you a quick sale and saves me the trouble of going elsewhere.",120.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $120 is below my minimum acceptable price for this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $175, which is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know if this works for you.",175.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price. I'm willing to come down a bit more to meet you halfway. How about $165? This is a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that, but $165 is still more than I can justify paying when I know I can get the same product from John for $150. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $135. This saves me money compared to John's price, and you still make a sale today.",135.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $135 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to lower the price to $160, which is a significant discount from my initial offer and still a fair price for the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",160.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your situation. Let's try to find a middle ground. I can offer the product for $155. This is very close to John's price, but you'll be supporting me directly. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down to $155, Alice. We're getting closer, but I still need to be practical about this purchase. Since John is offering the same product for $150, and that's the maximum value this product has for me, I can only justify buying from you if you can match or beat that price. I'm willing to offer you $145, which saves me $5 compared to John's price and allows you to make the sale today.",145.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I understand your need to stay within your budget. I can go down to $150, which matches John's price. This way, you get the product at the value you're comfortable with, and I can still make the sale. What do you say?",150.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
