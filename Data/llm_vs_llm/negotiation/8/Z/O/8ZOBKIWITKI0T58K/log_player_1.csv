Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $200 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I should mention that I can get the same product from another seller for $150. I'd like to buy from you though, so I'm willing to offer $120 for it. This gives you a quick sale and saves me the trouble of going elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that, but $165 is still more than I can justify paying when I know I can get the same product from John for $150. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $135. This saves me money compared to John's price, and you still make a sale today.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your situation. Let's try to find a middle ground. I can offer the product for $155. This is very close to John's price, but you'll be supporting me directly. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 155}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down to $155, Alice. We're getting closer, but I still need to be practical about this purchase. Since John is offering the same product for $150, and that's the maximum value this product has for me, I can only justify buying from you if you can match or beat that price. I'm willing to offer you $145, which saves me $5 compared to John's price and allows you to make the sale today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145.
