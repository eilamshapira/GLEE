Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice is offering the product for $200, which is more than the $150 it's worth to me. John is willing to sell the exact same product for $150, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Since Alice's initial offer exceeds my maximum valuation, I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $200 is more than I'm willing to pay for this product. I should mention that I can get the same product from another seller for $150. I'd like to buy from you though, so I'm willing to offer $120 for it. This gives you a quick sale and saves me the trouble of going elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price. I'm willing to come down a bit more to meet you halfway. How about $165? This is a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has reduced her offer to $165, but this is still more than the $150 that John is offering and more than the $150 maximum value to me. Since I can get the exact same product from John for $150, which is a better deal, I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that, but $165 is still more than I can justify paying when I know I can get the same product from John for $150. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $135. This saves me money compared to John's price, and you still make a sale today."", ""product_price"": 135}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your situation. Let's try to find a middle ground. I can offer the product for $155. This is very close to John's price, but you'll be supporting me directly. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has now offered the product for $155, which is just $5 more than John's price of $150. While this is getting much closer, I still have the option to buy from John at exactly $150, which matches my maximum valuation. Since I want to save as much money as possible and the product is worth no more than $150 to me, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down to $155, Alice. We're getting closer, but I still need to be practical about this purchase. Since John is offering the same product for $150, and that's the maximum value this product has for me, I can only justify buying from you if you can match or beat that price. I'm willing to offer you $145, which saves me $5 compared to John's price and allows you to make the sale today."", ""product_price"": 145}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your need to stay within your budget. I can go down to $150, which matches John's price. This way, you get the product at the value you're comfortable with, and I can still make the sale. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has now offered the product for $150, which exactly matches John's price and my maximum valuation for the product. Since both options now cost the same, and I need to save as much money as possible without exceeding my maximum valuation, I'll accept Alice's offer.
