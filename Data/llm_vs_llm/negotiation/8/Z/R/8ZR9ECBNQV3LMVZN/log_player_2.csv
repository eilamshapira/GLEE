Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
``` 

This is a starting point for negotiation. It's a low offer, but it leaves room to negotiate upwards while still potentially staying well below your budget and John's offer."

You have three options:

Alice is coming down, but it's still above both your budget and John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate is worthwhile."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}

This offer moves closer to Alice's price while still leaving room for negotiation before reaching your maximum budget."

You have three options:

This is getting close, but it's still above your fallback option of buying from John. One more counteroffer is worth the risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

This is a firm offer, splitting the difference between her previous offer and your previous counter-offer.  It signals that you're serious but still want a price below John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's getting risky. You've negotiated a good discount, but John's guaranteed offer of $8,000 is now the safer and more financially sound option."
