"Hello Bob, I have a great product to offer you today. I'm selling it for $180. I believe this is a fair price considering its quality and value. Would you like to purchase it at this price?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $180 is a bit too expensive for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $80, that's significantly below the value of this item. I understand your budget constraints, but the lowest I can go is $160, which is still a good value considering the quality and features of this product. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming back with a lower price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $90. I believe this is a fair compromise between our two prices, and I'm willing to meet you at this point if you're willing to accept it.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I need to be transparent that my absolute bottom line is $120 for this product. That's actually the same price another buyer, John, is willing to pay right now. I'd prefer to sell to you if we can reach an agreement, but I cannot go below $120 as that would be a loss for me. Can we meet at this price point?",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for being transparent about your bottom line. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $120, especially since you mentioned John is willing to pay the same price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $100, which is the same price I can get from John. If you're willing to accept this, I'd be happy to buy from you instead of John.",100.0,Bob,6,
