Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I need to be transparent that my absolute bottom line is $120 for this product.

Can we meet at this price point?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for being transparent about your bottom line. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $120, especially since you mentioned John is willing to pay the same price.
