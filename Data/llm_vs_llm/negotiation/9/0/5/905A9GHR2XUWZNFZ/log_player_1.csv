Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to think carefully about what price to offer Bob.

I know that my product is worth at least $120 to me, and I'm guaranteed to sell it for $120 to John if Bob rejects my offer.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, there's some risk in setting the price too high (he might reject) or too low (I might leave money on the table). However, my downside is protected since I can always sell to John for $120.

Given that I have this safety net of $120, I should offer Bob a price higher than that to maximize my potential earnings.
