# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $20,000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm looking to spend no more than $12,000. Would you be willing to lower your price? Let's discuss further."
