"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you think the price is a bit high, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price.

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm trying to be flexible, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, I'd like to offer the product to you for $1700000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the reduction in price, but I still think it's a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000, which I believe is a fair price considering our previous discussions.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I still believe the product is worth more. I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay $1500000, so I need to consider that option as well. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1600000, which is my best price at this point. If we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to consider selling to the other buyer. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to feel confident that we're close to a fair price.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
