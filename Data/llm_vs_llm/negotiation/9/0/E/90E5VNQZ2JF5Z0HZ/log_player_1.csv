"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional quality and the value it can bring to you, I'm confident that it's worth $15,000."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but Iâ€™m looking to stay within my budget. How about we agree on $10000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

# Explanation:
In this situation, selling to either Bob or John at $10,000 would yield the same result. However, since we have more rounds to negotiate, it's worth trying to sell at a higher price. If we eventually can't reach a better deal, we can still sell to John at $10,000, so there's no loss in trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that you have a budget to maintain. However, considering the product's benefits and long-term value, I believe $12,000 is a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

# Explanation:
I decided to decrease the price from the initial offer but keep it above the fallback option with John. This gives Bob a incentive to consider a higher price while still leaving room for further negotiation. If Bob accepts this offer, we'll make a profit compared to selling to John."
