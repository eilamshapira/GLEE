"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While it's lower than my initial asking price, it's not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This still represents a significant value for you, and allows me to proceed with the transaction.  What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
