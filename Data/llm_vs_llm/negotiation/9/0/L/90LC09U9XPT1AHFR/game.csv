"Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you. Given its quality and utility, I'm offering it to you for $130. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive from it.",130.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand $130 might seem high, $105 is too close to my bottom line. I know this product is worth significantly more than that in terms of value it provides. I can come down to $125, which I think is quite reasonable considering what you're getting.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  How about we split the difference and call it $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
