"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you. Given its quality and utility, I'm offering it to you for $130. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's starting price is closer to my maximum budget than it is to her own valuation. There's room for negotiation.  I'll try to bring the price down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand $130 might seem high, $105 is too close to my bottom line. I know this product is worth significantly more than that in terms of value it provides. I can come down to $125, which I think is quite reasonable considering what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

Alice is moving on the price, which is good. I'll hold firm for another round and see if I can get her closer to $110."
