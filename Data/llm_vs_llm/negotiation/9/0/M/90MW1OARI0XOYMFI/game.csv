"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. The product is worth no more than $1200000 to me, but I already have another offer from John at that same price. To make it worthwhile for me to purchase from you instead, I'd need a better deal. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. This would give you a reasonable sale while allowing me some room in my budget. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
