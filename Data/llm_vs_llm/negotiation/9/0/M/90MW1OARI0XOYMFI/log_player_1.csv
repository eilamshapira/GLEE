"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. The product is worth no more than $1200000 to me, but I already have another offer from John at that same price. To make it worthwhile for me to purchase from you instead, I'd need a better deal. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. This would give you a reasonable sale while allowing me some room in my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
