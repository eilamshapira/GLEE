"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my unique product to you at a price of $1200000. I believe this reflects its true value and provides an excellent opportunity. Please let me know if you accept this offer or would like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to consider my options carefully here. 

Alice is offering the product at $1,200,000, which is exactly the same price as John's alternative offer, and also exactly what the product is worth to Alice. This is also the maximum value of the product to me.

Since Alice's price matches John's price, and I wouldn't save any money by going with John, I should try to negotiate with Alice for a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I need to be mindful of my budget constraints. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, but I already have another offer from John at that same price. To make it worthwhile for me to purchase from you instead, I'd need a better deal. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This would give you a reasonable sale while allowing me some room in my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
