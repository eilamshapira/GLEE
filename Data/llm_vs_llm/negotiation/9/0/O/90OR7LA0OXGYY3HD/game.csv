"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $25000 is much higher than I am willing to pay. I am looking to spend no more than $10000 on this product. Would you be willing to sell it for this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. Unfortunately, $10000 is too low for this product. However, I can reduce my initial asking price. Would you consider $20000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and the product's quality justifies this price.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price, but $20000 is still too high for me. I can increase my offer to $12000. How about we meet halfway? Would you be willing to sell the product for this price?",12000.0,Bob,4,
