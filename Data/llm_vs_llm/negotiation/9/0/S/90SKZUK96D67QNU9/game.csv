"Hello Alice, thank you for presenting your product and offer. While I recognize its potential value, the price point you've presented is beyond my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing for $800000.  This offer reflects my assessment of its value within my own operational needs.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and offer. I appreciate your consideration, but $800000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. I currently have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1200000 for the product. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $1600000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true market value of the product while still giving you room for return on your investment.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1600000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant investment for me. To be candid, knowing another buyer is at $1200000 puts me in a tough spot.  I'd be willing to increase my offer to $1000000. This offer represents a fair compromise, recognizing the product's value while staying within my budget constraints. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and continued interest. However, $1000000 is still below what I can accept, especially considering I have a firm offer from John at $1200000. I value the potential of working with you, so I'm willing to meet you part way. My counteroffer is $1350000, which gives you a better price than my initial offers while still reflecting the product's true value. This is very close to my bottom line, considering the alternative offer I have on the table. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this negotiation has been a journey, and I respect your position.  Your latest offer moves things in the right direction.  To bridge the gap, I'd be willing to go up to $1100000. This is my final offer. It balances my budget with a fair price for the product. If this doesn't work, I wish you the best with John, and I'll pursue other options.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
