Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for presenting your product and offer. While I recognize its potential value, the price point you've presented is beyond my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing for $800000.  This offer reflects my assessment of its value within my own operational needs.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and offer. I appreciate your consideration, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. I currently have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $1,600,000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true market value of the product while still giving you room for return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1600000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant investment for me. To be candid, knowing another buyer is at $1200000 puts me in a tough spot.  I'd be willing to increase my offer to $1000000. This offer represents a fair compromise, recognizing the product's value while staying within my budget constraints. Let me know your thoughts.

However, $1,000,000 is still below what I can accept, especially considering I have a firm offer from John at $1,200,000. I value the potential of working with you, so I'm willing to meet you part way. My counteroffer is $1,350,000, which gives you a better price than my initial offers while still reflecting the product's true value. This is very close to my bottom line, considering the alternative offer I have on the table. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
