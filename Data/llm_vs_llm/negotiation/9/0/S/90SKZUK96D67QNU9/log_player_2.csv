Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and offer. I appreciate your consideration, but $800000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. I currently have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1200000 for the product. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $1600000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price better reflects the true market value of the product while still giving you room for return on your investment.

To be candid, knowing another buyer is at $1,200,000 puts me in a tough spot.  I'd be willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This offer represents a fair compromise, recognizing the product's value while staying within my budget constraints. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your increased offer and continued interest. However, $1000000 is still below what I can accept, especially considering I have a firm offer from John at $1200000. I value the potential of working with you, so I'm willing to meet you part way. My counteroffer is $1350000, which gives you a better price than my initial offers while still reflecting the product's true value. This is very close to my bottom line, considering the alternative offer I have on the table. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.
