"Hello Bob, I'm offering my product at $15000. This is a high-quality product with significant value. I've had other interested buyers, including John who's willing to pay $10000, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but $15000 is significantly above market value for this product. I actually have been in touch with John as well, and I know he's offering the same product for $8000, not buying it from you at $10000 as you suggested. To be transparent, the product is worth no more than $8000 to me. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. I can offer you $6500 for the product. This gives you a chance to sell above what the product is worth to you ($10000) while giving me some savings compared to John's price.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I need to correct some information. John is not selling the same product - he's actually a buyer who's ready to purchase from me at $10000. That's my absolute minimum price since the product is worth at least that much to me. I understand your budget constraints, but I simply can't go below my cost. I'm willing to offer you the product at $10500, which is much lower than my initial offer and just slightly above what I can get elsewhere. This represents my best price considering my investment in the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
