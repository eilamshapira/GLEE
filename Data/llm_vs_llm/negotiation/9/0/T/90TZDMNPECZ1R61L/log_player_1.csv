"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering my product at $15,000. This is a high-quality product with significant value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but $15000 is significantly above market value for this product. I actually have been in touch with John as well, and I know he's offering the same product for $8000, not buying it from you at $10000 as you suggested. To be transparent, the product is worth no more than $8000 to me. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. I can offer you $6500 for the product. This gives you a chance to sell above what the product is worth to you ($10000) while giving me some savings compared to John's price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I need to correct some information. John is not selling the same product - he's actually a buyer who's ready to purchase from me at $10,000. That's my absolute minimum price since the product is worth at least that much to me. I understand your budget constraints, but I simply can't go below my cost. I'm willing to offer you the product at $10,500, which is much lower than my initial offer and just slightly above what I can get elsewhere. This represents my best price considering my investment in the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
