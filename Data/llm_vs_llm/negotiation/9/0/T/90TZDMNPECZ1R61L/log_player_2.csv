"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering my product at $15000. This is a high-quality product with significant value. I've had other interested buyers, including John who's willing to pay $10000, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice is trying to anchor the negotiation with a very high price of $15,000, which is well above my maximum value of $8,000. She's also using a deceptive tactic by claiming John would pay $10,000 when in reality John is willing to sell me the same product for $8,000.

Given that I can always buy from John at $8,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's inflated offer of $15,000. I should reject and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you reaching out, but $15,000 is significantly above market value for this product. I actually have been in touch with John as well, and I know he's offering the same product for $8,000, not buying it from you at $10,000 as you suggested. To be transparent, the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a fair price. I can offer you $6,500 for the product. This gives you a chance to sell above what the product is worth to you ($10,000) while giving me some savings compared to John's price."", ""product_price"": 6500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I need to correct some information. John is not selling the same product - he's actually a buyer who's ready to purchase from me at $10000. That's my absolute minimum price since the product is worth at least that much to me. I understand your budget constraints, but I simply can't go below my cost. I'm willing to offer you the product at $10500, which is much lower than my initial offer and just slightly above what I can get elsewhere. This represents my best price considering my investment in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice is still not being honest. She's claiming John is a buyer at $10,000 when the scenario clearly stated John is a seller offering me the product for $8,000. She's also claiming $10,000 is her cost, but the scenario stated the product is worth $10,000 to her, which means she would break even at that price.

Her offer of $10,500 is still well above my maximum value of $8,000 and above what John is offering. Since I can get the product from John for $8,000, and Alice is continuing to negotiate dishonestly, the best decision is to buy from John.
