"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I see that Alice is offering the product for $150, but I know that the product is worth no more than $120 to me. John is already willing to sell me the same product for $120, which matches my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's offer ($150) is higher than both my maximum valuation and John's price, the logical choice is to buy from John.
