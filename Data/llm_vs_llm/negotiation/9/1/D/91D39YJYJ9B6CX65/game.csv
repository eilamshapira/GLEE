"Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I understand that you believe the product is worth $1800000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I'd like to make a counteroffer at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1000000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the worth of what I'm offering. How about we meet in the middle at $1600000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet in the middle. However, $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and it's also the price that John is offering me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
