Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I understand that you believe the product is worth $1800000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I'd like to make a counteroffer at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet in the middle. However, $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and it's also the price that John is offering me.
