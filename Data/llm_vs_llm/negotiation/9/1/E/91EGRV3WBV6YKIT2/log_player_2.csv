"Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer is already at the maximum price I'm willing to pay, which is $800,000, and it's the same price as what John is offering, I might as well buy it from Alice to save the hassle of dealing with another seller.
