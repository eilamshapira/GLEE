"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this situation:

- Alice is offering the product for $14,500
- The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
- I can buy from John for $15,000 as a fallback option
- The product costs Alice $10,000, so she has room to negotiate

Alice's current offer saves me $500 compared to buying from John. However, since the product costs Alice only $10,000, there's significant room for negotiation. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try to save more money.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives both Alice and myself a good deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze this situation again:

- Alice has lowered her price from $14,500 to $13,500
- This shows she's willing to negotiate further
- The new offer saves me $1,500 compared to buying from John
- However, since Alice's cost is $10,000, there's still room for negotiation

Alice has moved $1,000 from her initial offer, which is good progress. However, I believe we can still find a better middle ground. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.
