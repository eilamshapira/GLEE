"Good day Bob, I'm delighted to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional quality and the value it can bring to you, I'm sure you'll find our price of $3000000 quite reasonable.",3000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your product, $3000000 is significantly more than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $800000, which is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your candidness regarding your budget. However, I'm afraid $800000 is significantly lower than the value I place on the product. In light of this, I'm willing to lower my initial price to $2500000. This, I believe, better reflects the product's worth and our mutual interests.",2500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $2500000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer.  Let's meet halfway on this.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort in trying to bridge the gap. However, your current offer is still considerably low for me to consider. Let's try to meet halfway at $2000000. This price takes into account both our expectations and constraints.",2000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $2000000 is still a stretch. I'm prepared to offer $1500000, which is a significant compromise. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us before I have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
