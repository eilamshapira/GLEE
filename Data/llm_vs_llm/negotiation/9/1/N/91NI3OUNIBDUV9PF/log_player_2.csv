Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your candidness regarding your budget. However, I'm afraid $800000 is significantly lower than the value I place on the product. In light of this, I'm willing to lower my initial price to $2500000. This, I believe, better reflects the product's worth and our mutual interests.
