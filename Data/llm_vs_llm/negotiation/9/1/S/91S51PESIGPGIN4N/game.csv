"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a lower price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe this is a reasonable price, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and $9000 is tempting, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $10500? It's a fair compromise and we can finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,5,
