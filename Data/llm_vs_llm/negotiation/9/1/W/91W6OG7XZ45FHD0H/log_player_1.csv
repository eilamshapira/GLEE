Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a reasonably high price that leaves room for negotiation while still being potentially acceptable.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer ($6,000) is below my minimum acceptable value ($8,000) and actually even less than John's guaranteed offer ($8,000), I will reject this offer. However, since I always have John's $8,000 offer as a backup, I'll try one more negotiation round with Bob before potentially selling to John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my initial price somewhat but still maintain a price above my minimum threshold.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer ($7,000) is still below John's guaranteed offer ($8,000), and Bob's incremental increases suggest he might not be willing to go much higher, it's best to take the guaranteed higher amount from John rather than continue negotiating.
