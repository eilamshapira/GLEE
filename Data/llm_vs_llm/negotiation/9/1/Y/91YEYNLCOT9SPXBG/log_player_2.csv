"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to consider my options carefully. Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000, which is $300,000 more than my maximum value for the product ($1,200,000). I know I can always buy from John for $1,200,000, so I have no reason to accept an offer higher than that amount.

Since this is only round 1 of 10 possible rounds, I should try to negotiate with Alice to see if I can get a better price than John's $1,200,000.

Since my goal is to save as much money as possible and I know I can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, I should continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a better price.
