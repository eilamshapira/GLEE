Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer that's closer to Bob's valuation of $150, but leaving some room for negotiation if needed.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Given that the product is worth $150 to Bob, and his offer of $120 is significantly above my minimum value of $100, I'll reject this offer but continue negotiating as there's still room for a better deal than both Bob's current offer and John's fixed price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price slightly from my initial offer but still aim for a better deal than $120.
