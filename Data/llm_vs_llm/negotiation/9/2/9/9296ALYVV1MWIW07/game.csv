"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more than that to you and I'm happy with the price.  Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I see that your price is a bit above what I had in mind. Considering my other options, I'm prepared to pay $10500 for the product. I believe that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you can work with that.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11000?  It's a fair price that still leaves you with a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,
