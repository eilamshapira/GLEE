Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider the price I offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I have John willing to pay exactly that amount, I should set a price that gives me a chance to earn more than my guaranteed fallback option.

If I price it too high, Bob might reject it, and I'll end up with my guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. If I price it too close to $1,000,000, I won't maximize my potential profit.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'll set the price significantly higher than my minimum, but not so high that it seems completely unreasonable.
