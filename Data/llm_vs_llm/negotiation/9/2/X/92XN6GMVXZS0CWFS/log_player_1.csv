Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have this great product I think you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $160."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a bit steep for me, Alice.  How about $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, considering my goal is to earn as much as possible and the product is worth at least $120 to me, I will reject Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. While I appreciate it, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Okay, this is a tough one. My minimum acceptable price is $120. Bob's offer is $100. Rejecting and counter offering again runs the risk of getting an even lower offer, or Bob walking away. Selling to John guarantees $120.

Given the circumstances, I will sell to John.
