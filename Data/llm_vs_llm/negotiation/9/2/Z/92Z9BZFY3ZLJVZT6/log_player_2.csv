"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I believe could be a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it for $15000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $15,000
3. John is willing to sell it for $10,000

Since Alice's offer ($15,000) is higher than both:
- The maximum value I place on the product ($10,000)
- John's alternative offer ($10,000)

The logical choice is to buy from John for $10,000. This will save me $5,000 compared to Alice's offer and matches my maximum valuation of the product.
