"Bob, I have a very special product that I believe you would be interested in. It's truly one-of-a-kind and has the potential to be extremely valuable to the right person. I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant discount from what I believe its true market value could be.  Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1500000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, which is still a significant sum and demonstrates my interest in the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $1000000 is a respectable amount, it doesn't quite reflect the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1250000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This price still allows me to make a substantial profit, while also giving you a fair deal. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
