"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1500000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, which is still a significant sum and demonstrates my interest in the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This price still allows me to make a substantial profit, while also giving you a fair deal.
