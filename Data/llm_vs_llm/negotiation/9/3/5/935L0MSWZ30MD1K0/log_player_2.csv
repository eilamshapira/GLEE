"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a very special product that I believe you would be interested in. It's truly one-of-a-kind and has the potential to be extremely valuable to the right person. I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant discount from what I believe its true market value could be.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $1000000 is a respectable amount, it doesn't quite reflect the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1250000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This price still allows me to make a substantial profit, while also giving you a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, it's still slightly above what I'm comfortable spending. Since I have a guaranteed alternative with John, I'll go ahead and purchase from him."
