Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I was thinking that $127.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $120?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","This is an interesting turn of events! Bob's offer of $120 is exactly the same price that John is willing to pay, and it's also my minimum acceptable price. Since I won't be able to get a better price from John, and Bob's offer is already at my minimum acceptable price, I might as well accept Bob's offer and close the deal.
