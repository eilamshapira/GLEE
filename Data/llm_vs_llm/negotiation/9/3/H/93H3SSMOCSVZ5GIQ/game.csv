"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $130 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $130 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Given market conditions and similar products available, I can offer $70 for the product.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. However, $100 is still more than I can justify spending. I can increase my offer to $80, which is the absolute maximum I can spend on this product. This is a fair price that would work for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $80 is still significantly below what I need to get for this product. Let's meet in the middle at $90.  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and your need for it.",90.0,Alice,5,
