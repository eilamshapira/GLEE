"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $130 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $80 to me (maximum I'm willing to pay)
2. Alice's offer is $130, which is way above my maximum value
3. John is offering $80, which equals my maximum value
4. I can negotiate with Alice, but starting at $130 shows she's asking for much more than I can pay

Since Alice's initial offer ($130) is significantly higher than my maximum value ($80), and even higher than her own value ($120), it makes sense to reject and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $130 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Given market conditions and similar products available, I can offer $70 for the product."", ""product_price"": 70}

This counteroffer is strategic because:
1. It's below my maximum value ($80)
2. It gives room for negotiation upward
3. It signals to Alice that her initial price was too high
4. It's low enough to potentially anchor the negotiation closer to my target range
5. If Alice rejects, I still have John's offer of $80 as a backup"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze the current situation:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $130 to $100, showing willingness to negotiate
2. However, $100 is still above my maximum value ($80)
3. John's offer at $80 remains available and matches my maximum value
4. We've only used 3 rounds out of 10, so there's still room for negotiation
5. Alice moved down $30, which shows significant flexibility

Since $100 is still above my maximum value ($80), and we have more rounds to negotiate, I should reject and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $30 from her initial offer, I'll move up from my previous offer but still stay below my maximum value.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. However, $100 is still more than I can justify spending. I can increase my offer to $80, which is the absolute maximum I can spend on this product. This is a fair price that would work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}

This counteroffer is strategic because:
1. It meets my maximum value ($80)
2. It matches John's alternative offer
3. It shows I'm willing to move up from my initial offer
4. It clearly communicates this is my maximum price
5. If Alice rejects, I can still go to John without any loss
6. By stating it's my maximum, I'm being honest and setting clear expectations"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $80 is still significantly below what I need to get for this product. Let's meet in the middle at $90.  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and your need for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let's analyze the current situation:

1. Alice has come down from $100 to $90, showing further flexibility
2. However, $90 is still above my maximum value ($80)
3. John's offer at $80 remains available and matches my maximum value
4. Alice seems to be reaching her bottom limit, but it's still above what I can pay
5. We've used 5 rounds out of 10, but continuing negotiation might not be productive since:
   - I've already stated $80 is my maximum
   - Alice seems firm about not going below $90
   - I have a guaranteed option at $80 with John

Since I cannot pay more than $80 (my maximum value), and Alice seems unwilling to go that low, it makes the most sense to take John's offer now.
