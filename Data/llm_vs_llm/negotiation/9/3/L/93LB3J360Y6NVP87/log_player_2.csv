"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's offer of $9,500 is higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's fixed price ($8,000), it would not be rational to accept this offer. I have two reasonable choices: make a counteroffer to Alice or buy from John.

Given that Alice values the product at $10,000 and is starting with a high offer of $9,500, it might take several rounds of negotiation to reach a price below $8,000 (if possible at all). Since I have a guaranteed option to buy at $8,000 from John, which matches my maximum value, it's most rational to take this sure option rather than engage in potentially fruitless negotiation.
