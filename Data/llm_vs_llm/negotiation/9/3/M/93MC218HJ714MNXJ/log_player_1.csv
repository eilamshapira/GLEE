Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make a strong initial offer to Bob, considering that I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to him and I have a guaranteed backup offer of $800,000 from John.

{""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and it's a reasonable counteroffer to my initial price, I'll accept it. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's lower offer of $800,000.
