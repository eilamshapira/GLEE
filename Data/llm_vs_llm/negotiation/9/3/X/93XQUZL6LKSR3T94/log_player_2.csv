"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","The offer from Alice is $200, which is significantly above the maximum value of $120 that the product is worth to me. Additionally, I know that John is willing to sell the product for exactly $120.

Since Alice's offer exceeds both my maximum valuation and John's fixed price, it makes no economic sense to accept this offer.
