"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I need to carefully consider Alice's offer. She's offering the product for $1,300,000, which is $200,000 less than my maximum willingness to pay ($1,500,000), and also $200,000 less than John's fixed price.

However, since the product is worth only $800,000 to Alice, there's significant room for negotiation. I should reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Even if negotiations don't go perfectly, I still have the option to buy from John at $1,500,000 as a fallback.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's closer to Alice's cost while still giving her a fair profit.

{""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has lowered her offer from $1,300,000 to $1,200,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, there's still a large gap between her offer and the product's value to her ($800,000). 

Since we have plenty of rounds left (we're only in round 3 of 10), I should continue negotiating to try to get a better price. Alice has dropped her price by $100,000 after my first counteroffer, which suggests further negotiation could be fruitful.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down $100,000 from her initial offer, I'll increase my offer by a similar amount to show good faith in the negotiation while still trying to get a good deal.

{""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has lowered her offer again to $1,100,000, which is positive progress. She's reduced her price by $100,000 for each round, showing willingness to negotiate.

We're now at round 5 of 10, so we still have time to negotiate further. The current offer of $1,100,000 represents a $400,000 discount from John's price of $1,500,000, but I believe there's still room to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll continue the pattern of increasing my offer by $100,000 each round to show good faith and move towards a middle ground.
