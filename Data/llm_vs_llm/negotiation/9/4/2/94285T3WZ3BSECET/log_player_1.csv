Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $14500 is quite close to what I can get elsewhere. Since we're negotiating directly and eliminating middlemen, I'd like to propose a more mutually beneficial arrangement. I'm willing to purchase the product for $12000, which gives you a solid profit while allowing me some savings as well. This seems fair considering the market value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Okay, Bob's counteroffer is $12,000. While that's still a profit, I know the product is worth more to him. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel there's room for a more balanced deal. I can increase my previous offer to $12500. This gives you a significant profit margin while allowing me to save more than with your current offer. This seems fair for both of us given the product's value. Does this work for you?
