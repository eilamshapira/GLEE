"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I know you'll see the value. I'm offering it to you for a special price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to evaluate this offer from Alice. Let me think about this situation:

- The product is worth at most $15,000 to me (my maximum value)
- Alice values the product at $10,000 (her cost)
- Alice is offering to sell it to me for $14,500
- I can alternatively buy from John for $15,000

Alice's current offer of $14,500 is just slightly below my maximum value, which means I would only save $500 compared to buying from John. However, since Alice values the product at $10,000, there's significant room for negotiation. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer that would give me a better deal while still being profitable for Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $14,500 is quite close to what I can get elsewhere. Since we're negotiating directly and eliminating middlemen, I'd like to propose a more mutually beneficial arrangement. I'm willing to purchase the product for $12,000, which gives you a solid profit while allowing me some savings as well. This seems fair considering the market value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, but I need to ensure a reasonable return. Considering the value I know you place on this, how about:  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer. Let's analyze:

- Alice has reduced her price from $14,500 to $13,800, a reduction of $700
- She's now asking for $13,800, which is $1,200 less than John's price of $15,000
- Alice's cost is $10,000, so at $13,800 she'd make a profit of $3,800
- There seems to be room for further negotiation since I countered at $12,000

While this is a better offer, I think there's still room to negotiate for a better price. I should reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel there's room for a more balanced deal. I can increase my previous offer to $12,500. This gives you a significant profit margin while allowing me to save more than with your current offer. This seems fair for both of us given the product's value. Does this work for you?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to find a price we both feel good about. Let's meet in the middle. My final offer is:  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to carefully evaluate Alice's new offer:

- Alice has come down to $13,250 from her previous $13,800
- This is a $1,750 savings compared to John's price of $15,000
- Alice's cost is $10,000, so she's making a $3,250 profit
- She called this her ""final offer"" and suggested meeting in the middle
- We've gone through multiple rounds of negotiation already

Alice has moved from $14,500 to $13,800 and now to $13,250, showing willingness to compromise. At this point, the offered price provides a meaningful savings compared to my alternative option, and continuing to haggle risks Alice walking away. This seems like a reasonable point to accept the offer.
