"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. It's a good starting point that leaves room for negotiation but also reflects the product's worth to me.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for $4,000.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to $12,000, but I'm still confident that this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Hopefully, Bob sees this as a reasonable compromise and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not going to settle for anything less than $10,000. I'll reject his offer again.  I might be willing to come down a bit, but not that much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm willing to drop my price to $11,000 to try and meet Bob halfway. This is a significant reduction from my original asking price, but I still think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. I hope Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm starting to feel the pressure, Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not going to sell the product for $6,000.  I'll reject his offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm getting closer to John's offer, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.  I'm lowering my price to $10,500. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product. I hope Bob will finally accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This negotiation is taking too long, and I'm not getting closer to my desired price. Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not sure if we'll ever reach an agreement. To avoid wasting more time, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. It's not the best price, but it's still a decent profit."
