"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must decline. The product's value is significantly higher, and I have another buyer willing to pay $15000. However, I'm willing to give you priority if we can reach a fair agreement. My new offer is $16000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial price.",16000.0,Alice,3,
