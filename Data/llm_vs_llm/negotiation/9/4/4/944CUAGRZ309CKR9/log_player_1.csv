"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its exceptional value and market demand, I'm offering it at $20,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and quality."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that's a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product, considering I can get it from another seller for $8000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $7,500 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. In fact, it's even below his own stated maximum value of $8,000. I will make a counteroffer in the next round, but if we can't reach a more reasonable price point, I'll sell to John instead."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must decline. The product's value is significantly higher, and I have another buyer willing to pay $15,000. However, I'm willing to give you priority if we can reach a fair agreement. My new offer is $16,000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial price."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
