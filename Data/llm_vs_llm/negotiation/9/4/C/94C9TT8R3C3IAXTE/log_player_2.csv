"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think you'll find this product is a great fit for you. I'm offering it at a special price of $150. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if Alice can lower her price. The current offer is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I will make her a counteroffer to see if she can meet my budget.

# Counteroffer: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is too high for me. I can offer $60."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I'm interested in the product, but $150 is too high for me. I can offer $60."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $60 is quite below my cost for this item. How about we meet somewhere closer to the middle at $130? I believe you'll find it's worth the value! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer is still quite high compared to my budget and John's offer. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a more acceptable price.

# Counteroffer: $130 is still too high for me. I can offer $70."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I'm sorry, but $130 is still too high for me. I can offer $70."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob. Let's try to make this work for both of us. I can offer the product to you for $120. This is my best price, considering I have another buyer lined up at that amount. Let me know if we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is still much higher than my budget and John's offer. It's best for me to buy the product from John for $80, as it's closer to my budget, and I don't see a possibility for Alice to reduce her price to match my budget any time soon."
