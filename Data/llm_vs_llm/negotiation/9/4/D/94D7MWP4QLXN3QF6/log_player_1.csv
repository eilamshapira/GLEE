Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make a strategic offer to Bob. The product is worth $1,500,000 to him, but if he rejects my offer, I can still sell it to John for $1,000,000. 

Since I need to earn at least $1,000,000 (my reservation value), and Bob's maximum value is $1,500,000, I should offer a price that gives Bob some incentive to accept while maximizing my profit.

I'll offer the product at $1,300,000. This gives Bob a $200,000 surplus (since it's worth $1,500,000 to him), which should be enough incentive for him to accept, while giving me $300,000 more than my alternative option.
