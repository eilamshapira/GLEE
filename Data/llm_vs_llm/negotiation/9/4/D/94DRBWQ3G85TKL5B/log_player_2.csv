"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $100
2. Alice is offering it for $120
3. John is offering it for $100

Since Alice's offer ($120) is higher than both:
- My maximum value ($100)
- John's alternative price ($100)

It makes no economic sense to accept Alice's offer. Since I can get the same product from John at $100, which matches my maximum value, I should go with that option.
