"Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","The offer from Alice is $25,000, which is significantly higher than the product is worth to me (no more than $15,000). It's also higher than John's price of $15,000.

Since Alice's offer exceeds both my maximum value and the alternative option, I should not accept it. My best move is to either buy from John directly or try to negotiate with Alice for a better price.

Given that John is offering exactly what the product is worth to me ($15,000), and Alice's initial offer is so high, I'll choose to buy from John rather than continuing negotiations.
