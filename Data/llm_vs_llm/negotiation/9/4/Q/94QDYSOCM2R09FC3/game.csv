"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",750000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you think the initial price was steep, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. Considering your interest and the product's worth, I'm willing to slightly negotiate. However, I must emphasize that $1000000 is the lowest I can go, as it matches another offer I have. I'd like to meet you halfway between your offer and my initial price.",1125000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet me halfway. However, I still think $1125000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering you mentioned $1000000 is the lowest you can go, I'd like to make a serious offer of $950000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your revised offer of $950000, and I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, as I've mentioned before, $1000000 is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for this product. It's not just about the monetary value; it's also about the value this product brings to the buyer. Considering you've come up significantly from your initial offer, I believe you see the product's worth. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal if you meet me at $1000000, but I won't go below this price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,,
