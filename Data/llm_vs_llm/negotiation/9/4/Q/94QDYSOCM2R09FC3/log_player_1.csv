"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has tremendous value, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes its worth."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 1000000} 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $750,000 because it's lower than the product's worth to me and also lower than what I can get from John. My counteroffer is $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept, considering John's offer. This gives Bob a chance to reconsider and meet my minimum price requirement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you think the initial price was steep, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. Considering your interest and the product's worth, I'm willing to slightly negotiate. However, I must emphasize that $1,000,000 is the lowest I can go, as it matches another offer I have. I'd like to meet you halfway between your offer and my initial price."", ""product_price"": 1125000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet me halfway. However, I still think $1125000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering you mentioned $1000000 is the lowest you can go, I'd like to make a serious offer of $950000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 1000000} 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $950,000 because it's still slightly lower than the product's worth to me and also lower than what I can get from John. My counteroffer remains at $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Bob has increased his offer significantly, showing he's interested, but I need to hold out for the best possible deal, especially since John is offering the same amount without any negotiation hassle."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your revised offer of $950,000, and I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, as I've mentioned before, $1,000,000 is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for this product. It's not just about the monetary value; it's also about the value this product brings to the buyer. Considering you've come up significantly from your initial offer, I believe you see the product's worth. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal if you meet me at $1,000,000, but I won't go below this price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
