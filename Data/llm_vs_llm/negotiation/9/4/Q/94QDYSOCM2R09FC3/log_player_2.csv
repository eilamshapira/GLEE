Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you think the initial price was steep, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. Considering your interest and the product's worth, I'm willing to slightly negotiate. However, I must emphasize that $1000000 is the lowest I can go, as it matches another offer I have.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your revised offer of $950000, and I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, as I've mentioned before, $1000000 is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for this product. It's not just about the monetary value; it's also about the value this product brings to the buyer. Considering you've come up significantly from your initial offer, I believe you see the product's worth. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal if you meet me at $1000000, but I won't go below this price.
