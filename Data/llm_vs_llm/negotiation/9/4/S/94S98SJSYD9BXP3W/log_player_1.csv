Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 145}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","I'll analyze this situation:

- The product is worth $100 to me
- Bob values it at $150
- Bob has offered $140
- John will buy it for $100

Bob's offer of $140 is quite reasonable - it's 40% above my minimum value and only $10 below his maximum value. While I could try to negotiate a bit more, the $140 offer is strong enough that I should accept it rather than risk Bob walking away. It's also $40 more than John's guaranteed offer.
