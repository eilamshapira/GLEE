"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $200 for it.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up for $150. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice's offer is $200, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. Additionally, Alice mentioned she has another buyer lined up for $150, which suggests she might be willing to negotiate, but since my budget is $100, it's still not a good deal for me. Buying from John for $100 is a better option for me.
