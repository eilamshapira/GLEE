"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an exclusive product that I believe would be of great interest to you. I am offering it to you for a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the price Alice is offering ($850,000) is less than the price John is offering ($1,000,000) and also less than my maximum valuation of the product ($1,000,000), I should accept Alice's offer.
