"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that the initial price might be a bit high, but I'm afraid that $400000 is much lower that I can take. I would be willing to lower my initial price to $2000000. This product is quite valuable, and I believe that this new price reflects its worth. If you're interested in this new offer, please let me know.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
