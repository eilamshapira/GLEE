"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given that Alice's offer of $12,000 is higher than Jhon's fixed price of $10,000, and the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, it wouldn't make sense to accept Alice's current offer. I should either make a counteroffer or buy from Jhon immediately.

Since I have the opportunity to potentially get a better price than $10,000 through negotiation, I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives room for negotiation but starts significantly below the alternative option.

{""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her price from $12,000 to $11,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, her current offer of $11,000 is still higher than Jhon's price of $10,000. Since I can get the same product from Jhon for $10,000, and the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, I should either make another counteroffer or buy from Jhon.

I'll reject Alice's offer to see if I can negotiate an even better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $12,000 to $11,000, she's showing some flexibility. I'll increase my offer somewhat but still keep it below Jhon's price to try to get a better deal.

{""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her price to $10,500, which is still $500 more than Jhon's price of $10,000. Since I can get the same product from Jhon for $10,000, and the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, it wouldn't make sense to accept Alice's current offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer one more time to see if I can get her to match or beat Jhon's price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, which suggests she may be willing to go lower. I'll make one more attempt to get a better price than Jhon's $10,000.

{""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has now offered to sell the product for $10,000, which is the same price as Jhon's offer. Since both offers are now identical at $10,000 (which is the maximum value of the product to me), and I've been negotiating with Alice already, I'll accept her offer.
