"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price point that is more aligned with my budget. Let's start with $750000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 2750000} 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $750,000 because it's significantly lower than the product's value to me. I'm making a counteroffer of $2,750,000, which is still a bit lower than my initial offer but shows that I'm willing to negotiate. This price is closer to what I believe the product is worth, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me at this price or at least come closer to it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, and I'm willing to negotiate.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $1,000,000 because it's still lower than what I'm comfortable with. While it's closer than his previous offer, I believe the product's value is higher. I'm making a counteroffer of $2,375,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest proposal. This shows that I'm willing to continue negotiating but need a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.
