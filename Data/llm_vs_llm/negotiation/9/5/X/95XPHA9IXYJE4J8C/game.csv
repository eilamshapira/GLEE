"Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I'd like to offer to you. This product is of high quality and great value. I'm offering it to you for $15000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Let me know if you're interested.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $8000 is below what I can accept for this product. The quality and value it provides justifies a higher price. I can come down to $13500, which I believe is a fair compromise. Keep in mind that I have another buyer interested at $10000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $13500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think the price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given that you have another buyer interested at $10000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",9500.0,Bob,4,
