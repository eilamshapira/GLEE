Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $8000 is below what I can accept for this product. The quality and value it provides justifies a higher price. I can come down to $13500, which I believe is a fair compromise. Keep in mind that I have another buyer interested at $10000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a mutually agreeable price.

However, I still think the price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given that you have another buyer interested at $10,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500.
