"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $1,000,000
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: $1,000,000

Since Alice's offer is exactly the same price as John's offer ($1,000,000), and both prices are at my maximum acceptable price ($1,000,000), I am indifferent between accepting Alice's offer or buying from John. I might as well accept Alice's offer since she made the effort to negotiate.
