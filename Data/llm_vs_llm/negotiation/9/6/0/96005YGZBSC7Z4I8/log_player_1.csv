Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine the best price to offer Bob for the product.

The product is worth $8,000 to both Bob and me. If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell it to John for $8,000.

Since Bob values the product at $8,000, he would likely reject any offer above that amount. If I offer exactly $8,000, Bob would be indifferent between accepting and rejecting (since he gets no surplus), and might reject it.

Given that I have a guaranteed fallback option with John at $8,000, my optimal strategy is to offer the product to Bob at exactly $8,000. This maximizes my potential revenue while ensuring I don't lose the guaranteed $8,000 from John.
