"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1200000. This is a fantastic opportunity, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $900000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm confident about the value this product brings, and I believe it's worth a premium. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000?  This feels like a fair reflection of its true potential.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000, but I'm not sure I can go higher.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement on that.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in finding common ground. To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer who's offering $800000. While I believe your initial assessment of the product's value was closer, I'm willing to accept $1000000 to close this deal today. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your transparency, but $1000000 is still beyond my budget.  While I understand you have another offer, I'm only able to offer $975000 at this point.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  If you can't accept this offer, I'm going to have to look elsewhere.",975000.0,Bob,6,
