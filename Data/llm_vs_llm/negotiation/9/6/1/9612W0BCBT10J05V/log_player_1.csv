"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a fantastic opportunity, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're aiming for the highest possible price. Starting significantly above our minimum ($800,000) gives us negotiation room and helps gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Open Communication:**  The message emphasizes the product's value but keeps the tone collaborative and open to discussion.  We don't want to scare Bob away with an overly aggressive initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $900000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer is already above our minimum acceptable price ($800,000). This indicates potential for a better deal.
* **Early Stage:** We're only in round 2. Rejecting now allows us to explore if Bob is willing to go higher without risking the deal entirely.
* **John as Backup:** We have the security of John's offer, so we can afford to negotiate more firmly with Bob at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm confident about the value this product brings, and I believe it's worth a premium. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This feels like a fair reflection of its true potential."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've made a significant concession from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000, demonstrating our willingness to find an agreement.
* **Middle Ground:** The new price is a clear middle ground between Bob's offer and our initial ask.  This can make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal than our first offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the price and encourage Bob to move closer to our range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000, but I'm not sure I can go higher.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement on that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's counter-offer is only a $50,000 increase from his last offer, indicating slow progress in the negotiation.
* **Room for More:** We are still significantly above our minimum price, and there's room for Bob to increase his offer further.
* **Testing Commitment:** Rejecting this offer will help us gauge Bob's true interest and how committed he is to securing the product. 

We need to signal that we're willing to walk away if the price isn't right, even if it means taking John's offer. This should encourage Bob to be more aggressive in his next counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts in finding common ground. To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer who's offering $800,000. While I believe your initial assessment of the product's value was closer, I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 to close this deal today. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Urgency:** By mentioning John's offer, we're creating a sense of urgency and competition, which might encourage Bob to act faster.
* **Final Offer Tactic:**  Clearly stating this is our final offer increases the perceived value of the concession and puts the ball firmly in Bob's court.
* **Justification and Compromise:** We're justifying the price by referencing Bob's initial valuation while framing the $1,000,000 as a compromise for a quick resolution.

This approach aims to secure a strong price without dragging out the negotiation further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your transparency, but $1000000 is still beyond my budget.  While I understand you have another offer, I'm only able to offer $975000 at this point.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  If you can't accept this offer, I'm going to have to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $975,000 is a substantial profit margin and significantly higher than our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Plateau:**  Bob's counter-offer shows only a small increase, suggesting he's likely near his maximum price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Pushing further risks losing Bob entirely.  Accepting now secures a very favorable outcome. 

While we could try for a slightly higher price, the potential gain is outweighed by the risk of losing Bob as a buyer. Accepting the $975,000 offer is a prudent decision at this stage."
