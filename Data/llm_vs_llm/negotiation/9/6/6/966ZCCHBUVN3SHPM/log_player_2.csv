"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm asking $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice is offering the product for $100, which is less than the $150 value it has to me (and less than John's price of $150), this is a good deal. I should accept this offer as it saves me $50 compared to buying from John.
