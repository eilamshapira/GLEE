"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product to me. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $5000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $20000. What do you say?",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $20000, but I'm still a bit far from my target budget. I'd like to propose a price of $7000, which is closer to what I'm willing to pay. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're trying to meet in the middle, and I appreciate that. Let's try to find a fair compromise. I can go as low as $18000 for this product. Is this something you can work with?",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and lower the price to $18000. However, I'm still quite far from my budget. Considering I have another option to buy the product from John for $8000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet at this price.",7500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints and the other offer you have. However, the value of this product to you should be considered. I'm willing to lower my price further to $16000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,7,
