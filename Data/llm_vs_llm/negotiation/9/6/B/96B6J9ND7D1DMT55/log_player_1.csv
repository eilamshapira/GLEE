Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Starting significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000 vs. $1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit margin. 
* **Confident language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""exceed your expectations"" aim to increase the product's perceived value in Bob's mind.
* **Open to negotiation:** The question ""What do you think?"" signals that I'm open to discussing the price and potentially negotiating a mutually beneficial deal.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's perspective:** While I know Bob's valuation, I need to be prepared for him to counter-offer or walk away entirely. 
* **Alternative buyer:** Having John as a backup ensures I can sell the product at my minimum price if negotiations with Bob fail.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still maintaining a professional and persuasive approach with Bob."
