Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. However, I believe a price of $80 would be more reasonable for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $80 is too low for me, and I have a better option to sell to John for $120 if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you think the product is worth $80, but I believe it's worth more. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a better price. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 150}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. How about we settle on a price of $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Although $100 is getting closer to my target, I still think I can get a better price from Bob, and I have the option to sell to John for $120 if the negotiation doesn't go well. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob.
