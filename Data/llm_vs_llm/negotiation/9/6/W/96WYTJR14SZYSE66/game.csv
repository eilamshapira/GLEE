"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $90. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I still believe the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, so I'll meet you in the middle at $100. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",100.0,Alice,3,
