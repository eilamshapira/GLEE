"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $110, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I believe a price of $90 is more in line with where I'd be comfortable. Let's see if we can meet at $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $90 is still lower than my target price, and I believe Bob is willing to pay more since the product is worth $120 to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $90. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I still believe the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, so I'll meet you in the middle at $100. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 100}"
