Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe the price of $2500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to make a counteroffer. Considering my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $400000. I think this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000
