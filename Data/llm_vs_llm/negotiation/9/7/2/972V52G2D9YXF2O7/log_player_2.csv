Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe the price of $2,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to make a counteroffer. Considering my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $400,000. I think this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 400000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest and counteroffer, Bob. However, $400000 is significantly below the product's true value. My minimum acceptable price is $1000000, and I believe the product is worth considerably more. I can adjust my initial offer to $2000000, which I think is still a fair price given the product's quality and value. Would you consider this revised offer?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and adjusting your price. However, $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I understand that you mentioned your minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000, but I'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $600,000, which is still a significant investment for me. I hope we can work together to find a fair price."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
