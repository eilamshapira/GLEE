"Hello Bob, I have a premium product that I'd like to offer you. This product has exceptional quality and value. I'm offering it to you for $30000. Please let me know if you're interested.",30000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you Alice, but $30000 is way above my budget. I'm looking to spend no more than $5000 on this product. Would you be willing to sell it for this price?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5000 is significantly below the market value of this product. My cost basis is $15000, so I can't go that low. However, I'm willing to come down from my initial offer. I can offer it to you for $25000, which represents a substantial discount from its true value. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $25000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7000 to meet you in the middle. Would you consider this price?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but $7000 is still well below my cost on this product. I need to be clear that my absolute minimum is $15000, which is my break-even point. I'm willing to come down significantly from my earlier price to $22000, which would still give you excellent value. If your budget constraints are firm, I may need to consider other options as I have another interested buyer at $15000.",22000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $22000 is still beyond my budget. I can increase my offer to $8500, but that's the highest I can go. If this doesn't work for you, I understand that you may need to consider other options.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your increased offer to $8500. However, I need to be transparent that I cannot sell below $15000 as that's my actual cost for this product. I've lowered my price considerably from my initial offer, and I can come down to $19000 as my final offer. This is still a great value for the quality you're receiving. If your budget truly cannot accommodate something closer to my minimum, I unfortunately will need to accept the standing offer I have from another buyer at $15000.",19000.0,Alice,7,
