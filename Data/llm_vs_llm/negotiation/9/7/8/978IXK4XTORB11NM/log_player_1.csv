Round 2
Bob's offer:

I've lowered my price considerably from my initial offer, and I can come down to $19,000 as my final offer. This is still a great value for the quality you're receiving. If your budget truly cannot accommodate something closer to my minimum, I unfortunately will need to accept the standing offer I have from another buyer at $15,000."", ""product_price"": 19000}"
