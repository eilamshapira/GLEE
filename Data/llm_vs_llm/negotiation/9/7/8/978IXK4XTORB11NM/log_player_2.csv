Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5000 is significantly below the market value of this product. My cost basis is $15000, so I can't go that low.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but $7000 is still well below my cost on this product. I need to be clear that my absolute minimum is $15000, which is my break-even point. I'm willing to come down significantly from my earlier price to $22000, which would still give you excellent value. If your budget constraints are firm, I may need to consider other options as I have another interested buyer at $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $22,000 is still beyond my budget. I can increase my offer to $8,500, but that's the highest I can go. If this doesn't work for you, I understand that you may need to consider other options."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your increased offer to $8500. However, I need to be transparent that I cannot sell below $15000 as that's my actual cost for this product. I've lowered my price considerably from my initial offer, and I can come down to $19000 as my final offer. This is still a great value for the quality you're receiving. If your budget truly cannot accommodate something closer to my minimum, I unfortunately will need to accept the standing offer I have from another buyer at $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
