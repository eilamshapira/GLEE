Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12250 is still a bit more than I can manage. How about we settle at $11750? This way, we're both moving closer to a middle ground.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","I'm going to weigh my options carefully.

*   **Accepting Bob's Offer:** $11,750 profit.
*   **Selling to John:** $10,000 profit.
*   **Counter-offer:** This could lead to a higher price, but it also risks Bob walking away or the negotiations dragging on with no guarantee of success.

I still have a few rounds left, but the gap is closing. I'll risk one more round to see if I can nudge the price up slightly.
