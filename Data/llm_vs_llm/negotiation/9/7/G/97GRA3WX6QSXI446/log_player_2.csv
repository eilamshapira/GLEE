"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","The product is worth a maximum of $10,000 to me. Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is far too high. I would be losing money by accepting it. Buying from John at $10,000 guarantees I don't overpay, but there's a chance to get the product for less by negotiating with Alice. Since this is Round 1 and I have 10 rounds, I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price.
