"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Based on the information provided, I'll analyze the best course of action:

1. Alice's offer is $15,000
2. The product is worth at most $8,000 to me (Bob)
3. I can buy the same product from John for $8,000

Since Alice's offer ($15,000) exceeds both the value of the product to me ($8,000) and the alternative offer from John ($8,000), the logical choice is to buy from John.
