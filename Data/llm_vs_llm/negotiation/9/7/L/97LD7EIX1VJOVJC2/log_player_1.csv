"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit.

{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","I'll reject Bob's offer since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 (which I can get from John), and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Now, I'll make a new offer: {""product_price"": 16000}

This lower price shows I'm willing to negotiate while still maintaining a good profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $9,500 is still well below what I can get from John ($12,000). Since we're only in round 4 and Bob has increased his offer from $8,000 to $9,500, there's still room for negotiation, but I won't accept anything below $12,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price a bit more but still keep it well above my minimum of $12,000.

{""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offers are gradually increasing but still remain below what I can get from John ($12,000). Given that we're now in round 6 out of 10, and Bob's highest offer is still $1,500 below my guaranteed price from John, I think it's time to be more decisive. Rather than risk running out of rounds with a deal below $12,000, I'll sell to John.
