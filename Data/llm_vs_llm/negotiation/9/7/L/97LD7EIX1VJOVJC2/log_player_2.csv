"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to make a decision here. Alice's offer is $20,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum value of $12,000, and also higher than John's guaranteed price of $12,000.

Since Alice's initial offer is much higher than what I'm willing to pay, and equal to what John would sell it for, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

Since Alice made a significant reduction in her first counteroffer, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating with another counteroffer.
