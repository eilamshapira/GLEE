(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me and even lower than what I can get from John, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Considering Bob's offer was $500,000 and I initially offered $2,000,000, I'll try to find a middle ground while still aiming high. My counteroffer will be $1,750,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's new offer of $700,000 is still lower than what I can get from John, but it's an increase from his previous offer. Since I have more rounds to negotiate and Bob seems willing to increase his offer, I'll reject this offer and try to get closer to my target or at least match what John is offering.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Given that Bob has increased his offer to $700,000 and I'm aiming to get the best possible deal, I'll slightly reduce my previous counteroffer to encourage further negotiation. My new counteroffer will be $1,400,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to what I can get from John ($1,000,000), but it's still slightly lower. Since Bob has been increasing his offers, it suggests he's interested in the product and might be willing to go a bit higher. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal than what John is offering.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Considering Bob's latest offer of $900,000 and my goal to get the best possible price, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly above what John is willing to pay, to see if Bob is willing to meet or exceed that price. My counteroffer will be $1,050,000.
