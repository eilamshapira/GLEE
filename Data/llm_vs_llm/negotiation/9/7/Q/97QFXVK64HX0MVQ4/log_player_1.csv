Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. 

Since the product is worth $80 to Bob, and I know I can definitely sell it to John for $80, I can try to get a bit more from Bob. If Bob rejects, I don't lose anything since I have John as a guaranteed backup buyer at $80.

I'll offer the product at a slightly higher price to try to maximize my profit.
