"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in! It's a [briefly describe the product, highlighting key features]. I'm asking for $175 for it. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

The reason for rejecting Alice's offer is that the price of $175 exceeds my budget of $80. Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $80, which is within my budget, I will explore that option instead of accepting Alice's higher offer."
