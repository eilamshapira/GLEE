Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000}

Rationale: Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay this amount, there's no reason for me to offer Bob a lower price. If Bob accepts, I get $1,200,000, and if he rejects, I still get $1,200,000 from John. Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so he will likely reject this offer, but that's fine because I won't lose any value by selling to John instead."
