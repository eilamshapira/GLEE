"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15000 is quite high for me. Given the market conditions and my budget constraints, I can offer $10000 for the product. This would be a fair price that works well for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your response and understand your budget constraints. However, I can agree to a lower price than my initial offer. How about we settle at $13500? I think this could be a win-win for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. However, $13500 is still above my budget. I could stretch my previous offer to $11000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market value. This would give you a quick sale while meeting my budget constraints.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your latest offer. I understand you’re working within a budget, so let’s find a middle ground. How about a selling price of $12500? I believe this reflects its value while still being a significant step closer to your budget. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,5,
