"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to present you with an amazing opportunity to purchase my product. I believe it could be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I should not accept Alice's offer of $15,000 since it's higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000). Since I can buy from John at $12,000 anytime, I can try to negotiate with Alice for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's below both my maximum value and John's price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is quite high for me. Given the market conditions and my budget constraints, I can offer $10,000 for the product. This would be a fair price that works well for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your response and understand your budget constraints. However, I can agree to a lower price than my initial offer. How about we settle at $13500? I think this could be a win-win for both of us. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $13,500 is still higher than both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000). Since I can get the product from John for $12,000, there's no reason to accept a higher price. I'll continue negotiating with Alice for a better price, but if we can't reach a deal below $12,000, I can always fall back on John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer, slightly increasing my previous offer but still keeping it well below John's price to leave room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. However, $13,500 is still above my budget. I could stretch my previous offer to $11,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market value. This would give you a quick sale while meeting my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your latest offer. I understand you’re working within a budget, so let’s find a middle ground. How about a selling price of $12500? I believe this reflects its value while still being a significant step closer to your budget. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's offer of $12,500 is still higher than John's price of $12,000. Since I can get the exact same product from John for $12,000, there's no reason to pay more. At this point, since Alice seems reluctant to go below $12,000 and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, it would be most practical to take John's offer.
