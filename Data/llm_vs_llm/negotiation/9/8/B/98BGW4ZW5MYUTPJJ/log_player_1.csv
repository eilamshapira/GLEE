Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price to offer Bob...

Bob values the product at $12,000, so that's his maximum willingness to pay. I have a guaranteed backup offer of $8,000 from John. To maximize my profit while giving Bob some incentive to accept, I should offer a price below $12,000 but well above my minimum of $8,000.

I'll offer $10,500 - this gives Bob $1,500 in value ($12,000 - $10,500) while allowing me to earn $2,500 more than my backup option ($10,500 - $8,000).
