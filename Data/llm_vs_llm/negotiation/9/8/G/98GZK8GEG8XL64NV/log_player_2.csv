"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $10,000 and also higher than John's price. It would be better to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If negotiations with Alice don't work out, I can always fall back on John's offer of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 8000}

I'll offer $8,000 which is below John's price of $10,000. This gives some room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to John's offer. If Alice's value is lower than $8,000, she might accept, and if not, we can continue negotiating or ultimately go with John's offer if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has lowered her price from $15,000 to $12,500, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but this is still above John's price of $10,000. There's no reason to accept a price higher than John's guaranteed offer. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, as we still have several rounds remaining to potentially get a better deal than John's $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9000}

I'll increase my offer to $9,000, which is $1,000 higher than my previous offer but still $1,000 less than John's price. This shows I'm willing to move up in price while still maintaining the potential to save money compared to John's offer. Since Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing her price, this higher offer might be more appealing to her while still being beneficial for me."
