"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's initial offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($120), and I have the option to buy it from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately. However, I also don't want to give up the potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of getting a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable considering I'm willing to pay up to $120. Since Alice's worth for the product is $80, I'll start by offering a price that is slightly above that, to leave room for negotiation and to test Alice's flexibility.

{""product_price"": $90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's new offer of $115 is closer to my maximum budget of $120, but it's still $5 less than what I could get from John. Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get an even better deal.

Given that Alice was willing to come down from $120 to $115, it suggests she might be willing to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, trying to meet somewhere in the middle between my previous offer of $90 and Alice's current offer of $115.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Next, I would send a counteroffer of $100 to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","As mentioned, I'll send a counteroffer of $100 to Alice, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us.
