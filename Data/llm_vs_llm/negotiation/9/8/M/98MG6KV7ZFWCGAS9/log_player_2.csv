"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Okay, let's analyze the situation:

*   **Alice's Offer:** $1,200,000
*   **My Value:** $1,500,000 (maximum I'm willing to pay)
*   **Alice's Value:** $1,000,000 (minimum she's willing to accept)
*   **John's Offer:** $1,500,000

Since Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than the maximum I'm willing to pay ($1,500,000) and is a better deal than buying from John ($1,500,000), I should accept the offer.
