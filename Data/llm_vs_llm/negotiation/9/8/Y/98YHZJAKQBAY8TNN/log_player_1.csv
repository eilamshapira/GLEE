"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this awesome product! I'm willing to let it go for $250. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $250 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $50. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Given Bob's counteroffer of $50, and knowing the product is worth at least $150 to me, I have to reject his offer. I also have a better option than accepting $50.

Therefore, my decision is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $50 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $200?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $50 was a lowball offer, but $200 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and yours, so how about $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","This is a tough spot. $125 is better than nothing, but I know John will pay $150. I only have a few rounds left, so I need to make a decision. I can either try to negotiate with Bob a little bit longer, or cut my losses and go with a sure thing.

Considering the remaining rounds and the value of the product to John, I'll take the sure thing now.
