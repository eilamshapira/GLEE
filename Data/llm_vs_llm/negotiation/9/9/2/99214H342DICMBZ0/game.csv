"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18000. This is a competitive price for the value it provides.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $18000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs and the value I'll get from the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $8000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product's quality and market value justify a higher price. However, I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price. I can offer it to you for $15000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for reducing your asking price. However, $15000 is still a bit above what I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $10000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise between our two positions.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate that you've moved up to $10000, which shows we're making progress in our negotiation. However, given the product's value, I believe we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $12500, which is a substantial reduction from my previous offers. This price reflects both the product's true value and my desire to work with you on this deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
