"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $18,000. This is a competitive price for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $18000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs and the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject Bob's offer of $8,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round, as there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob than what John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $8,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product's quality and market value justify a higher price. However, I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price. I can offer it to you for $15,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for reducing your asking price. However, $15000 is still a bit above what I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $10000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise between our two positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob is now offering the same price as John ($10,000), I'll reject and make another counteroffer. There's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob, and we have several rounds remaining. If we can't reach a better deal, I can always fall back to either Bob's or John's $10,000 offer later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate that you've moved up to $10,000, which shows we're making progress in our negotiation. However, given the product's value, I believe we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is a substantial reduction from my previous offers. This price reflects both the product's true value and my desire to work with you on this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
