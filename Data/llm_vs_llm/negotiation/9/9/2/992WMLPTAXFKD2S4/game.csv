"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in your premium product, $18000 is beyond what I can pay for it. The product is worth no more than $15000 to me, and I've actually received an offer from another seller at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better agreement. Would you consider $12500 for the product? This would give me a reason to choose your offer over the alternative.",12500.0,Bob,2,
