"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in your premium product, $18000 is beyond what I can pay for it. The product is worth no more than $15000 to me, and I've actually received an offer from another seller at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better agreement. Would you consider $12500 for the product? This would give me a reason to choose your offer over the alternative. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will send Bob a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I appreciate your interest in my product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,000. This is a fair deal considering the value you'll be getting. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
