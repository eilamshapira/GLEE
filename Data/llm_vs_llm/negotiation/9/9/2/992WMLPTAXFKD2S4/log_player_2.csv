"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my premium product to you for $18000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value and quality it brings. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","After analyzing Alice's offer, I can see that she's asking for $18,000, which is $3,000 more than what the product is worth to me ($15,000). Also, I know I can buy the same product from John for $15,000, which is the maximum value I place on this product.

There's no reason for me to accept Alice's current offer at $18,000 when I have a guaranteed option to buy at $15,000. Since I can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations with Alice don't work out, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in your premium product, $18,000 is beyond what I can pay for it. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and I've actually received an offer from another seller at that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a better agreement. Would you consider $12,500 for the product? This would give me a reason to choose your offer over the alternative."", ""product_price"": 12500}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I appreciate your interest in my product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15000. This is a fair deal considering the value you'll be getting. What do you think?

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price, and the product is worth $15,000 to me, I don't have a financial reason to prefer one seller over the other. I might as well accept Alice's offer since we've already been negotiating.
