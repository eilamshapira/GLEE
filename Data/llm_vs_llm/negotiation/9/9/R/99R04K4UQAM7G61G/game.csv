"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, I think you'll find it very useful. I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it, but I'm not sure I'm willing to go higher.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's a fair price for a quality product like this.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to sell, I need to get a fair price.  How about $125? That's my final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $110, and I really don't think I can go higher than that.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here of you going up in small increments.  I need you to be serious about this purchase.  My last offer is $117.50.  Take it or leave it.",117.5,Alice,7,
