"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features, I'm initially proposing a price of $1300000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing what might work for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1300000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000, considering the market value and my own financial constraints. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to negotiate further.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I appreciate your perspective, $600000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This reflects my investment and the value this product brings.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and come down to $1100000. However, this is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I'd like to propose a price of $750000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can meet somewhere closer to this range.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations. I've already adjusted my price considerably.  To be frank, anything under $950000 is not feasible for me.  I'm firm on this price, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go while still respecting the value of what I'm offering.",950000.0,Alice,5,
