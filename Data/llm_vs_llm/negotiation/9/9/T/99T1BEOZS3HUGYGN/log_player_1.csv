Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1300000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000, considering the market value and my own financial constraints. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to negotiate further.
