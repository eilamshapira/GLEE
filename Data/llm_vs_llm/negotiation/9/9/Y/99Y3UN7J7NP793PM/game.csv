"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6000 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand budget constraints, I simply cannot go that low as the product's value to me is $10000. I can reduce my initial asking price to $10500, which is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Please let me know if this works for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
