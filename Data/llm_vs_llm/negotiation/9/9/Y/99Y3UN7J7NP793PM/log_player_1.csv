Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $12,000. This is a competitive price for a product of this caliber."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of this product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to offer $6000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

As the product is worth $10,000 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price, I won't accept an offer of $6,000. I'll make a new counteroffer to Bob, but if we can't reach an agreement above $10,000, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is significantly below the product's value. While I understand budget constraints, I simply cannot go that low as the product's value to me is $10,000. I can reduce my initial asking price to $10,500, which is a fair price considering the product's quality and market value. Please let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
