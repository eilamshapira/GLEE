Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $175. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 175}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering. That price is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob since $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I want to try negotiating before taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for this product given its value. I can offer it to you for $160, which is a more reasonable price considering its quality."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product Alice, but I'm on a tight budget.  How about $130? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's maximum offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and John is willing to pay $150, it's best to sell to John and ensure I get my minimum price."
