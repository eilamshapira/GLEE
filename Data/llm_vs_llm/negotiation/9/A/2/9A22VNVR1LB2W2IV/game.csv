"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9500 is a bit too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I am willing to negotiate further. How about we split the difference and settle on $10500? This price is still fair considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
