"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11500.  This price reflects the product's quality and potential benefits. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $11,500 is close to my maximum budget of $12,000, but still above the value Alice has for the product ($10,000), I believe there's room for negotiation to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable, considering the product's value to Alice is $10,000. My goal is to save as much money as possible while still being realistic about the negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe the product is valuable, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I think this price reflects a fair value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9500 is a bit too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I am willing to negotiate further. How about we split the difference and settle on $10500? This price is still fair considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, considering the product's value to her is $10,000. However, it's a significant drop from her initial offer of $11,500, showing she's willing to negotiate. Since I have a budget of $12,000 and Alice's offer is getting closer to what I consider a fair price, I'll think about accepting it. But first, I'll try to negotiate a bit more to see if I can get an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice's latest offer was $10,500, and considering she's already come down significantly from her initial offer, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one but still lower than her current offer. This approach shows I'm willing to meet her halfway while trying to save as much money as possible.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. This price aligns with the value you mentioned the product holds for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both parties."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
