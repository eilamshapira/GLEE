"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Based on the information provided, I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, reject it, or buy from John.

Alice's offer is $1,200,000, which is higher than the maximum amount the product is worth to me ($800,000). If I accept this offer, I would be paying more than the product's value to me.

John is offering the same product for $800,000, which equals exactly the maximum value of the product to me.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and John's offer doesn't exceed what the product is worth to me, the logical choice is to buy from John.
