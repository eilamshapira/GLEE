Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $100 to him and $80 to me, I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

{""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $75 is below both my minimum acceptable price ($80) and John's guaranteed offer ($80), it would not be rational to accept it. Additionally, since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, there's no reason to accept anything lower. I'll reject Bob's offer.

Since I have a guaranteed $80 from John and Bob's opening offer was quite low (even below my minimum), rather than continuing negotiations which might not be productive, I'll take the sure deal.
