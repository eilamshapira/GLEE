,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6000. I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and constraints.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, and I understand your budget constraints. However, I can't sell the product for $6000. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility, but I still can't go as low as $7500. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $10500? I believe this would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for continuing to negotiate, Alice. I'm getting closer to my budget limit, but I still think we can find a better price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I may need to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I understand your budget constraints. However, I can't accept $8000. How about $9500? I believe that would be a fair price for the value of the product. Let me know if that works for you!",9500.0,Alice,7,
