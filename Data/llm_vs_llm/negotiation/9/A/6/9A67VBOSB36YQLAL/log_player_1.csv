"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since the product is worth $12,000 to me and I have John's guaranteed offer at that price, I'll start with a higher price to test Bob's willingness to pay.

{""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","I'll reject Bob's offer of $8,000 as it's well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Since I know the product is only worth $10,000 to Bob, and I have a guaranteed offer from John at $12,000, there's no reason to accept anything lower than $12,000.
