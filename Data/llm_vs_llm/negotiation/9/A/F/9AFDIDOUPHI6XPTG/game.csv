"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I was thinking more along the lines of meeting in the middle. I'd be willing to sell it to you for $140, which is a great deal considering the product's value. Let me know if that works for you!",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit high for me.  How about $100?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Since you came up from $80 to $100, I'm willing to come down a bit more from $140. How about we meet at $120? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value, and it's a good compromise for both of us.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $120, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Would you be willing to go down to $110? That would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",110.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. Since you're willing to pay $110, I'm willing to come down a bit more from $120. How about we meet at $115? I think that's a very reasonable price, and it's the lowest I'm comfortable going. Let me know if that works for you!",115.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at this point.",110.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're firm on $110, but I'm trying to find a middle ground. Considering my last offer was $115, I'm willing to split the difference. How about $112.50? It's a small compromise on my part, and I think it's a fair price for the product. If we can't agree on this, I may need to explore other options.",112.5,Alice,9,
