Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target price. $80 is too low for me, and I think I can get a better deal from Bob or sell it to John for $150 if necessary."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I was thinking more along the lines of meeting in the middle.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit high for me.  How about $100?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Since you came up from $80 to $100, I'm willing to come down a bit more from $140. How about we meet at $120? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value, and it's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $120, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Would you be willing to go down to $110? That would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. While $110 is getting closer to my target price, I still think I can get a better deal from Bob. Since he's willing to negotiate and has come up significantly from his initial offer of $80, I'll try to meet him halfway again. I'll aim for a price that's slightly below my previous offer, but still above $110."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. Since you're willing to pay $110, I'm willing to come down a bit more from $120. How about we meet at $115? I think that's a very reasonable price, and it's the lowest I'm comfortable going. Let me know if that works for you!"", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer, but I'm running out of room to negotiate. Since Bob has gone back to offering $110, which I've already considered, I'll try to split the difference between my last offer and his. I'll offer $112.50, which is a small concession on my part, and see if Bob is willing to meet me at that price. If not, I may need to consider selling to John for $150."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're firm on $110, but I'm trying to find a middle ground. Considering my last offer was $115, I'm willing to split the difference. How about $112.50? It's a small compromise on my part, and I think it's a fair price for the product. If we can't agree on this, I may need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 112.50}"
