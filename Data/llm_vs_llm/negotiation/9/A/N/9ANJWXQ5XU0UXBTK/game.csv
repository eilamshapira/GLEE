"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in doing business with me. After evaluating the product and considering its market value, I can offer $1100000 for it. This represents a substantial profit margin for you while still allowing me room to benefit from the purchase. I believe this is a fair offer that works well for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must point out that $1100000 is significantly below the product's market value. While I understand your position, I'm willing to adjust my initial price to $1300000. This represents a $200000 reduction from my first offer, demonstrating my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. This price still allows you to realize substantial value from the product while ensuring a fair return for me.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for reducing your price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1300000 is an improvement, I believe we can find a middle ground that's beneficial for both of us. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $1200000, which represents a substantial $200000 profit for you above your cost. This is a fair compromise between our positions and allows both of us to walk away satisfied with the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
