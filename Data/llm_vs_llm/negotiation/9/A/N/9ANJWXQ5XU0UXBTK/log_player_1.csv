Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in doing business with me. After evaluating the product and considering its market value, I can offer $1100000 for it. This represents a substantial profit margin for you while still allowing me room to benefit from the purchase. I believe this is a fair offer that works well for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since $1,100,000 is too low considering the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000). There's still room for negotiation between his offer and my initial price, and it's still better to negotiate with Bob than to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must point out that $1,100,000 is significantly below the product's market value. While I understand your position, I'm willing to adjust my initial price to $1,300,000. This represents a $200,000 reduction from my first offer, demonstrating my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. This price still allows you to realize substantial value from the product while ensuring a fair return for me."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for reducing your price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1300000 is an improvement, I believe we can find a middle ground that's beneficial for both of us. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $1200000, which represents a substantial $200000 profit for you above your cost. This is a fair compromise between our positions and allows both of us to walk away satisfied with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,200,000. While there might be room to negotiate further, this is a reasonable compromise that gives me a good profit ($200,000 above my minimum price), and continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away or becoming frustrated. The $1,200,000 offer is significantly better than John's $1,000,000, and it's a fair price considering the overall circumstances."
