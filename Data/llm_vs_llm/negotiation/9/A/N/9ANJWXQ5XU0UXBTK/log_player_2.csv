"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be very beneficial for you. Given its high market value and potential returns, I'm offering it at $1400000. This price reflects the product's true worth while still leaving room for profitable utilization on your end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I should evaluate this offer from Alice. She's offering the product for $1,400,000, while I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to her. I also have the option to buy from John for $1,500,000, but that's my absolute maximum price and would be my worst-case scenario.

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than John's price, but I can likely negotiate a better deal with Alice since she has a much lower cost basis. I should reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer.

After evaluating the product and considering its market value, I can offer $1,100,000 for it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must point out that $1100000 is significantly below the product's market value. While I understand your position, I'm willing to adjust my initial price to $1300000. This represents a $200000 reduction from my first offer, demonstrating my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. This price still allows you to realize substantial value from the product while ensuring a fair return for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her price from $1,400,000 to $1,300,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, there's still a significant gap between her offer and my previous counteroffer of $1,100,000. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to her, there's still plenty of room for negotiation.

The $1,300,000 price is better than John's $1,500,000, but I should try to negotiate further to save more money.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for reducing your price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is an improvement, I believe we can find a middle ground that's beneficial for both of us. I'm prepared to increase my offer to $1,200,000, which represents a substantial $200,000 profit for you above your cost. This is a fair compromise between our positions and allows both of us to walk away satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
