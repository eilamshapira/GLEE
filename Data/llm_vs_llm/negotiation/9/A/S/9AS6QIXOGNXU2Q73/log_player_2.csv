Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm glad you like it. However, I have to say that $90 is a bit too low for me. I can offer you a discount, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Let me see what I can do.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $120, considering the product's value. I can offer you a slight discount from my original price, but I think $120 is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Alice is unwilling to budge from $120, which is the same price John is offering. There's no point in continuing negotiations if we can get the same price elsewhere."
