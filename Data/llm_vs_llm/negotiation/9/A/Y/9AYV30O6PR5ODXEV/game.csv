"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand that the product has exceptional value, but the price is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000, considering the product's quality and market position.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your counteroffer. However, I need to be transparent that my absolute minimum price is $1500000, which reflects the product's true baseline value to me. I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at this price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $2100000, which still represents excellent value given the product's quality and market potential. Would you consider this revised price?",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for being transparent about your minimum price. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $2100000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000, which is the highest price I'm comfortable paying for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair value for the product, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your increased offer. While $1200000 shows you're serious about acquiring this product, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1500000, which represents the product's essential value to me. I have John ready to purchase at this price, but I'd still prefer to work with you. My final offer is $1850000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents exceptional value given the product's quality and potential. I hope we can reach an agreement, but I must be clear that I cannot go below $1500000 under any circumstances.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
