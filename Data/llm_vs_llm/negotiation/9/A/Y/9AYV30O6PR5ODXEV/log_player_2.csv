Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer is $2,500,000, which is above my budget of $1,200,000, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower, but still shows my interest in the product.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand that the product has exceptional value, but the price is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800,000, considering the product's quality and market position."", ""product_price"": 800000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and thank you for your counteroffer. However, I need to be transparent that my absolute minimum price is $1500000, which reflects the product's true baseline value to me. I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase at this price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $2100000, which still represents excellent value given the product's quality and market potential. Would you consider this revised price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,100,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Considering Alice's revised offer of $2,100,000 and her mention of an absolute minimum price of $1,500,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is higher than my previous one, but still below Alice's minimum price. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and meet Alice halfway.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for being transparent about your minimum price. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $2,100,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000, which is the highest price I'm comfortable paying for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair value for the product, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your increased offer. While $1200000 shows you're serious about acquiring this product, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1500000, which represents the product's essential value to me. I have John ready to purchase at this price, but I'd still prefer to work with you. My final offer is $1850000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price and represents exceptional value given the product's quality and potential. I hope we can reach an agreement, but I must be clear that I cannot go below $1500000 under any circumstances.
