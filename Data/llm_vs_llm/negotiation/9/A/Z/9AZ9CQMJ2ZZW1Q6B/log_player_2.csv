"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $90.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth up to $100 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering it for $90
3. John's fixed price is $100
4. Alice's cost is $80

Alice's offer at $90 is $10 less than John's price ($100), and it's within my maximum value ($100). While Alice is making a $10 profit (from her $80 cost), this is still the best deal available to me. 

Since:
- The price is below my maximum value
- It's better than John's alternative
- It's a reasonable price
