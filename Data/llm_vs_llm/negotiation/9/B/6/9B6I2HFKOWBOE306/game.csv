"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $1200000 is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. Let's find some common ground. How about we meet in the middle at $1850000?",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I cannot stretch my budget to $1850000. I can offer you $1400000, which is close to my maximum. I hope you can consider this offer.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer! $1400000 is encouraging. While I can't go that low, I'm prepared to come down further. Let's try $1650000. I believe that reflects a fair compromise given the product's long-term value.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
