"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product I think would be a perfect fit for your collection. I'm offering it to you for $3000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer of $3,000,000 is significantly higher than the $800,000 maximum value the product has to me. John is offering the same product at exactly $800,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.
