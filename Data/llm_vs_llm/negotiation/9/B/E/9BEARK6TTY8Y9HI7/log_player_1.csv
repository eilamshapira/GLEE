Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its worth to me."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product; however, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's counteroffer of $1,000,000 is the minimum value the product is worth to me, and selling it to John would also be for $1,000,000, I don't see a benefit in selling to John at this point. I'd like to try to negotiate a better price with Bob.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1050000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to the product's value to him, which is $1,200,000. Since I've already rejected offers at $1,000,000 and $1,100,000, and Bob is willing to pay $1,050,000, I think it's worth trying to squeeze out a bit more value.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","It seems like Bob has reverted back to his previous offer of $1,050,000. Since I've already considered this price in Round 4 and decided to counteroffer, and now that we're in Round 6, I think it's time to reconsider accepting this offer. We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.
