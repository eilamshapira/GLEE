# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’d like to offer you the product for $1500000. I believe its exceptional value aligns perfectly with your needs. Please let me know if you’d like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Looking at Alice's offer, she is selling the product for $1,500,000, which is exactly what it's worth to her and exactly the maximum I'm willing to pay. This is also the same price that John is offering.

Since all prices are identical ($1,500,000), and I need to purchase the product, there's no financial advantage to choosing one seller over another.
