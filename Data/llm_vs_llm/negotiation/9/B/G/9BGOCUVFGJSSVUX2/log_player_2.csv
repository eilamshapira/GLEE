"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a high-quality product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $250, which represents excellent value given its features and quality. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Looking at this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $120 to me (Bob)
2. Alice is offering the product for $250
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $120

Since Alice's price ($250) is significantly higher than both the value of the product to me ($120) and John's alternative price ($120), the rational choice would be to decline Alice's offer and purchase from John instead.
