"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Given market conditions and my budget, I can offer $85 for the product.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $85 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's value and quality, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $170.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you've come down in price, but $170 is still much higher than what I can justify spending. Looking at market prices and considering my budget, I can go up to $90. This is a fair increase from my previous offer.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $90 is still below my expectations. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $160. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair value considering the product's quality and demand.",160.0,Alice,5,
