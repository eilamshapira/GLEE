Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth a premium price due to its high quality and demand. I'm willing to let it go for $180."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is much higher than what I'm looking to spend. Given market conditions and my budget, I can offer $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $85 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me, I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to reach a more favorable price. Selling to John for $150 is an option, but I'll try to negotiate with Bob a bit more to see if we can meet at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $85 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's value and quality, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $170."", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you've come down in price, but $170 is still much higher than what I can justify spending. Looking at market prices and considering my budget, I can go up to $90. This is a fair increase from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $90 is still significantly lower than the product's worth to me. While he has increased his offer, it's not enough to meet my minimum requirements. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round to try to reach a more favorable price. Selling to John for $150 is still an option, but I'll continue to negotiate with Bob to see if we can meet at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $90 is still below my expectations. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $160. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair value considering the product's quality and demand."", ""product_price"": 160}"
