"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $90, I need to be clear that my cost for this item is higher than that. I'm willing to come down from my initial price though. I can offer it to you for $105, which is still a good deal considering the $120 value you'll get from it. This allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.",105.0,Alice,3,
