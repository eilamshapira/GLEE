"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. After careful consideration, I've decided on a price that I believe reflects its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1150000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer of $1,150,000, reject it, or buy from John for $1,200,000.

Alice is offering the product for $1,150,000, which is $50,000 less than John's price of $1,200,000.

Since the product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, and Alice's offer is below that amount, it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer rather than paying the higher price to John.
