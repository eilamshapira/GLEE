"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I find the price of $2100000 to be a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $400000, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs and the product's value to me.",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must decline your offer of $400000 as it's significantly below the product's market value. While I can be flexible on the initial price I proposed, I cannot go below $1700000 given the product's quality and worth. This represents a $400000 reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a fair market price. Would you consider this revised offer?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for being willing to negotiate. I appreciate the $400000 reduction from your initial price. However, $1700000 is still above my budget for this product. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $700000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise between your asking price and my budget. I'm interested in finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,
