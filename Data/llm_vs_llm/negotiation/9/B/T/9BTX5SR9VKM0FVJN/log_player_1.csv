Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I find the price of $2100000 to be a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $400000, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs and the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I reject Bob's offer of $400,000 as it is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for being willing to negotiate. I appreciate the $400000 reduction from your initial price. However, $1700000 is still above my budget for this product. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $700000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise between your asking price and my budget. I'm interested in finding a mutually beneficial agreement.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I choose to sell to John for $1,200,000. Bob's offer of $700,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and given that we're quite far apart in our valuations, it seems unlikely we'll reach a mutually acceptable price. John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 is the better business decision."
