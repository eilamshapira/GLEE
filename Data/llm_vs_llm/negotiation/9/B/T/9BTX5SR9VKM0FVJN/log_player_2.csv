Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I must decline your offer of $400000 as it's significantly below the product's market value. While I can be flexible on the initial price I proposed, I cannot go below $1700000 given the product's quality and worth. This represents a $400000 reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a fair market price. Would you consider this revised offer?
