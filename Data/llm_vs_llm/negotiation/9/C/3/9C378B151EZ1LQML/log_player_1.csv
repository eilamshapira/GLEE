Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer to Bob. Since I know the product is worth $100 to him and $150 is my minimum acceptable price, I should start high to leave room for negotiation, but not so high that it immediately ends the conversation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $80 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, there's no reason to accept Bob's low offer. While I could try another counteroffer, it's clear that Bob's initial counteroffer is very low, suggesting we're quite far apart in our price expectations. Given that I can secure $150 from John, which meets my minimum threshold, the most rational decision is to take the guaranteed sale.
