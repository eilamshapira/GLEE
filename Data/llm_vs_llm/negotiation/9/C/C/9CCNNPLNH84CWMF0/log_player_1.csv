"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my offer to Bob for round 1:

```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, considering Bob's offer of $90 and my options:

*   **Accepting** nets me $90.
*   **Rejecting** means potentially getting a higher price from Bob in the future rounds but risks not selling at all.
*   **Selling to John** gets me $80.

Since my minimum acceptable price is $80 and Bob is currently offering $90, I should accept the offer.
