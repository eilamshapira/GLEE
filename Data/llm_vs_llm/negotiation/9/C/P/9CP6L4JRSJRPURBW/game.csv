"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I can only offer $4000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints.",4000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, after considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to lower my price to $18000. This is still a fair price given the product's value. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $18000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $5500, which is a significant stretch for me. I hope we can meet at this price.",5500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I've reconsidered and I'm willing to lower my price to $16000. This is very close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a fair price that respects both your budget and the product's value. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to lower the price. However, $16000 is still far beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $6500, which is the highest I'm comfortable going. If we can't meet at this price, I may need to consider other options.",6500.0,Bob,6,
