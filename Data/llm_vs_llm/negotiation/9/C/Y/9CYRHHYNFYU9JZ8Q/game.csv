,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $25000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs and the potential value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10000 is far too low. As I mentioned, the product has considerable value. However, I'm willing to come down from my initial price. How about $23000?",23000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $23000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $16500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential value while remaining within my budget.",16500.0,Bob,4,
