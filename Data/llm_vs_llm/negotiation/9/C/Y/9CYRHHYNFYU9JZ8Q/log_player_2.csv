Alice's offer is way too high.  Let's see if we can get her down closer to my limit."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $25,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs and the potential value to me."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10000 is far too low. As I mentioned, the product has considerable value. However, I'm willing to come down from my initial price. How about $23000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $23,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $23,000

Alice is still too high.  I'll counter again, but I'm getting closer to buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $23,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $16,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential value while remaining within my budget."", ""product_price"": 16500}
