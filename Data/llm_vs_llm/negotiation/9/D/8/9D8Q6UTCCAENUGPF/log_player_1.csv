Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for getting back to me, Bob. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $145. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still need to get a fair price for the product. Let me know if this works for you!"", ""product_price"": 145}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","This is an interesting turn of events. Since Bob's offer of $120 is exactly my minimum acceptable price, and it's also the same price that John is willing to pay, I don't see any advantage in continuing to negotiate with Bob. I might as well accept Bob's offer and close the deal.
