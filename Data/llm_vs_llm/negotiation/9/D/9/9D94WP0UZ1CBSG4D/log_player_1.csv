Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a reasonable offer for Bob that maximizes my earnings while considering that I have a guaranteed fallback option of $15,000 from John.

Since I know my minimum acceptable price is $15,000, I should set my offer to Bob higher than this amount. Setting it too high risks rejection, but setting it too close to $15,000 doesn't maximize my potential profit.

Without knowing Bob's valuation, I'll offer a price that represents a meaningful premium over my guaranteed alternative while still being potentially acceptable to a buyer who values the product.
