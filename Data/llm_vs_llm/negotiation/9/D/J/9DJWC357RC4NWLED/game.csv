"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I need to be candid about my budget constraints. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me based on my needs and financial situation. I actually have another seller, John, who's already offered me the same product for $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can come to a reasonable agreement. I'd like to offer $650000, which gives us both room to negotiate to a price that works for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,2,
