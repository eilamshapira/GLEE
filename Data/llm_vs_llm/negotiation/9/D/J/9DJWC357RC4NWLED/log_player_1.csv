Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential benefits, I'm proposing a price that reflects its worth. I'd like to start the negotiation at $1,500,000."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I need to be candid about my budget constraints. The product is worth no more than $800000 to me based on my needs and financial situation. I actually have another seller, John, who's already offered me the same product for $800000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can come to a reasonable agreement. I'd like to offer $650000, which gives us both room to negotiate to a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
