"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential benefits, I'm proposing a price that reflects its worth. I'd like to start the negotiation at $1500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","$1,500,000 is much higher than the $800,000 maximum value this product has to me, and even higher than the $1,000,000 it's worth to Alice. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I need to be candid about my budget constraints. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me based on my needs and financial situation. I actually have another seller, John, who's already offered me the same product for $800,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can come to a reasonable agreement. I'd like to offer $650,000, which gives us both room to negotiate to a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
