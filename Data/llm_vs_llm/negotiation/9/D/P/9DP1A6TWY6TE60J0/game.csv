"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to negotiate, but I hope we can meet somewhere closer to this price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1650000. This price takes into account the product's exceptional quality, its value to you, and my own costs. I'm willing to consider further negotiations, but I hope we can meet somewhere closer to this price.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that we're getting closer, but I still think $1650000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. How about we settle on $1425000? I believe this is a fair price that takes into account both our interests.",1425000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. Considering your interest in the product and the progress we've made so far, I'm willing to make a slight concession. How about we settle on $1550000? I believe this price is more in line with the product's value, and it's the lowest I'm comfortable going.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your concession, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1550000. Considering my budget and the fact that I can buy a similar product from John for $1000000, I'm willing to make a final offer of $1250000. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
