Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your concession, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1550000. Considering my budget and the fact that I can buy a similar product from John for $1000000, I'm willing to make a final offer of $1250000. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.

I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, as it's a better offer than Bob's final offer of $1,250,000. I've tried to negotiate with Bob, but we couldn't reach a mutually agreeable price. Selling to John ensures that I get a fair price for the product."
