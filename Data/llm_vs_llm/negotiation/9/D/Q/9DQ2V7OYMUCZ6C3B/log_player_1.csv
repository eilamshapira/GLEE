Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer and for meeting me halfway. I appreciate your concession and willingness to negotiate. However, $1500000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. Considering your previous concession, I'm willing to make a slight increase in my offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

After considering Bob's latest offer, I have decided that $825,000 is still too low compared to the alternative of selling the product to John for $1,200,000. Since my minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000, and Bob's offer is significantly lower, I think it's in my best interest to sell the product to John, ensuring I meet my minimum price requirement."
