Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($12,000) and also lower than what I initially offered, I will reject his offer. I will not sell to John yet because I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob. So, I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

My counteroffer is $14,000.

However, according to the format, my decision for this round is:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's new offer of $7,000 is still lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($12,000). Since his offer is increasing, it shows he's interested, but it's still not near my acceptable range. I will reject his offer again and try to find a middle ground that is more favorable to me.

My decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed with a new counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my new counteroffer is: {""product_price"": 13000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is increasing, but it's still far from my initial valuation and even further from my last counteroffer. However, considering that Bob's offer is now $8,000 and my alternative is selling it to John for $12,000, I should try to get closer to my goal or at least ensure I don't go below what John is offering if possible.

Given that Bob's value for the product is $12,000, and he's currently offering $8,000, there's still room for negotiation. My next step would be to try and meet him somewhere in the middle or closer to my desired price, but since his offers are gradually increasing, I might consider making a more significant concession to see if we can finalize the deal.

My decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed with a new counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

And my new counteroffer is: {""product_price"": 12000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.
