"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price Alice is offering ($150) is the same as John's price, and it's the maximum I'm willing to pay. Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, there's room for negotiation to get a better price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 110}

I'll offer $110, which is slightly above Alice's cost ($100). This gives Alice a $10 profit while still being significantly better than the $150 alternative. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it acknowledges that Alice needs to make some profit while also trying to get a good deal for myself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has lowered her price from $150 to $140, showing she's willing to negotiate. However, since the product is worth $100 to her, there's still room for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, aiming for a price point that's more favorable while still giving Alice a reasonable profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 120}

I'll increase my offer to $120, which is halfway between my previous offer ($110) and Alice's current offer ($140). This represents a $20 profit for Alice, which is quite reasonable, while still being significantly better than John's price of $150. This shows I'm willing to move up from my initial position and negotiate in good faith."
