Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $75 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80, I will reject his offer. I still think I can get a better price from him, so I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $95 might be a bit steep, but I'm afraid I couldn't go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $90 is still a bit high for me. How about we try $80? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","This is an interesting turn of events. Bob's offer of $80 is exactly the same price that John is willing to pay, and it's also my minimum acceptable price. Since I won't be able to get a better price from Bob, and I have another buyer willing to pay the same amount, I might as well accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him.
