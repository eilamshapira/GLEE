My counteroffer will be $130.

So, my decision is:

My decision is to reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

Since Bob's offer is increasing, it shows that he's interested in the product and willing to pay more. I'll try to split the difference again between my previous offer of $122.50 and his current offer of $118.

My decision is to reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer of $119 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $120. At this point, I think it's likely that we're nearing the end of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the sale.

Considering that Bob's offer is only $1 less than my previous counteroffer, I'm willing to accept his offer of $119. This price is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's a good compromise.

My decision is: {""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
