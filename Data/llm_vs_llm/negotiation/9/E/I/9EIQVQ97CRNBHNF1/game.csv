"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, and I'm asking for $20000 for it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your product, but $20000 is beyond my budget. I know I can get a similar product from another seller for $15000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $12000 for your product. This gives you a quick sale without having to find another buyer.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $12000 is too low for me. This product is very valuable, and I'm confident it's worth more to you than a similar product from another seller.  I'm willing to come down to $17000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make a deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find middle ground. However, I still can't go above $15000, as that's the maximum I'm willing to pay and exactly what John is offering me for a similar product. To make it worth choosing you over the other seller, I can offer $13500. This gives you a quick sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still below my minimum.  I'm confident this product is worth more to you than what John is offering.  How about we split the difference and settle on $16250?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the value you get.",16250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best value for your product, but I need to be clear about my position. The product is worth no more than $15000 to me, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. To give us both a win, I'm willing to offer $14500, which is my final offer. This is very close to my maximum budget while still giving you a guaranteed sale today. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to go with John's offer.",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer.  However, $14500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my last one.  How about $15375? This is a fair price that will give you a great product and still allow me to make a decent profit.  Let's close this deal.",15375.0,Alice,7,
