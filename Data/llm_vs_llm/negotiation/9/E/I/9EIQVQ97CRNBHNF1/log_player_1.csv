Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your product, but $20000 is beyond my budget. I know I can get a similar product from another seller for $15000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $12000 for your product. This gives you a quick sale without having to find another buyer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find middle ground. However, I still can't go above $15000, as that's the maximum I'm willing to pay and exactly what John is offering me for a similar product. To make it worth choosing you over the other seller, I can offer $13500. This gives you a quick sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm confident this product is worth more to you than what John is offering.  How about we split the difference and settle on $16,250?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the value you get."", ""product_price"": 16250}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best value for your product, but I need to be clear about my position. The product is worth no more than $15000 to me, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. To give us both a win, I'm willing to offer $14500, which is my final offer. This is very close to my maximum budget while still giving you a guaranteed sale today. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500.
