"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, and I'm asking for $20000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","The offer from Alice is $20,000, which is higher than both:
- The maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($15,000)
- The guaranteed alternative from John ($15,000)

Since Alice's offer exceeds my maximum value and there's a guaranteed alternative at my maximum value, there's no reason to accept this offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your product, but $20,000 is beyond my budget. I know I can get a similar product from another seller for $15,000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for your product. This gives you a quick sale without having to find another buyer."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget, but $12000 is too low for me. This product is very valuable, and I'm confident it's worth more to you than a similar product from another seller.  I'm willing to come down to $17000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","The offer from Alice is $17,000, which is still higher than both:
- The maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($15,000)
- The guaranteed alternative from John ($15,000)

Since I can buy the product from John for $15,000, there's no reason to accept an offer that's higher than that amount.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find middle ground. However, I still can't go above $15,000, as that's the maximum I'm willing to pay and exactly what John is offering me for a similar product. To make it worth choosing you over the other seller, I can offer $13,500. This gives you a quick sale while saving me some money compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still below my minimum.  I'm confident this product is worth more to you than what John is offering.  How about we split the difference and settle on $16250?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the value you get. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","The offer from Alice is $16,250, which is still higher than:
- The maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($15,000)
- The guaranteed alternative from John ($15,000)

There's no reason for me to pay more than my maximum value or more than John's offering price.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best value for your product, but I need to be clear about my position. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. To give us both a win, I'm willing to offer $14,500, which is my final offer. This is very close to my maximum budget while still giving you a guaranteed sale today. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your final offer.  However, $14500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my last one.  How about $15375? This is a fair price that will give you a great product and still allow me to make a decent profit.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice is offering $15,375, which exceeds both my maximum value ($15,000) and the alternative option from John ($15,000). Since I can get the same product from John for a lower price, and Alice's offer exceeds my maximum budget, the most rational choice is to go with John's offer.
