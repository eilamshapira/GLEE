"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $150, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but $100 is lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $140. This is a more reasonable price considering the product's value, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $140 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $115.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid to $115. However, I'm still hoping we can meet at a price that's a bit more favorable to me. Considering the product's value and John's offer of $120, I'm willing to sell it to you for $125. This is my best offer so far, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering John's offer of $120, I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let's finalize this deal.",120.0,Bob,6,
