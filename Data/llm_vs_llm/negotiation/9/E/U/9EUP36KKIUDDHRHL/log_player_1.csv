"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny of $150, considering its quality and value. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $100 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get a better deal from Bob or sell it to John for $120 if negotiations don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but $100 is lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $140. This is a more reasonable price considering the product's value, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $140 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $115.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Although $115 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still slightly below. Since John is willing to buy the product for $120, I have a safety net, and I'd like to try to get a better offer from Bob or at least match what John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid to $115. However, I'm still hoping we can meet at a price that's a bit more favorable to me. Considering the product's value and John's offer of $120, I'm willing to sell it to you for $125. This is my best offer so far, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering John's offer of $120, I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Since Bob has finally met the price that John is willing to pay, and it's also the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'll accept Bob's offer of $120. There's no advantage in continuing to negotiate or selling to John at this point, as the price is the same."
