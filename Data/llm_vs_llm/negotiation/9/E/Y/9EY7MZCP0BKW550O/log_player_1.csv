Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my options carefully. If Bob accepts my offer, I'll make more than the $100 that John is willing to pay. However, if I set the price too high, Bob might reject it.

The product is worth $150 to Bob, which means he would gain surplus value for any price below that. Since I have a guaranteed $100 from John if Bob rejects my offer, I should set a price that maximizes my chance of making more than $100 while still being attractive to Bob.

I'll offer a price that gives Bob some surplus value but still significantly increases my profit compared to selling to John.
