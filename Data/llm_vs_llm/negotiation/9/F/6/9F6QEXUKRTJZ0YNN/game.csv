"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity. This product is truly one-of-a-kind and I believe it will be immensely valuable to you. I'm initially offering it for $3000000.",3000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I believe this product could be valuable to me, $3000000 is far beyond my current budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1000000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $1000000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I value your interest, I can't go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle a bit. How about $2750000?",2750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $2750000 is still too high for me. Perhaps we can find a price point that works for both of us.  Would you consider $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but we're still quite a ways apart. My absolute bottom line, considering its unique value and potential return for you, is $2500000. I really can't go any lower than that. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents a substantial concession on my part. Let me know what you think.",2500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're trying to find a compromise, and I respect that.  However, that price is still a significant leap for me.  To be frank, anything over $1500000 would make me seriously consider John's offer.  Would you be willing to settle at $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
