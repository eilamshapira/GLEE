Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

My absolute bottom line, considering its unique value and potential return for you, is $2,500,000. I really can't go any lower than that.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're trying to find a compromise, and I respect that.  However, that price is still a significant leap for me.  To be frank, anything over $1500000 would make me seriously consider John's offer.  Would you be willing to settle at $1350000?
