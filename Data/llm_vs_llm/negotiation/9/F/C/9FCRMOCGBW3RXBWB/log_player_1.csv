"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $75 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and I have the option to sell to John for $100, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I will also not sell to John immediately, as I want to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

My counteroffer to Bob is: $125

I'm waiting for Bob's response.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $100 is equal to my minimum acceptable price and also equal to the price that John is willing to pay, I don't see any benefit in continuing to negotiate with Bob. In this case, accepting Bob's offer or selling to John would result in the same price, so I might as well accept Bob's offer and end the negotiation here.
