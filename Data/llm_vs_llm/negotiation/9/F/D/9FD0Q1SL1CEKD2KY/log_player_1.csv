"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $1,200,000 to me and only $1,000,000 to Bob, I'll start with a high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum value.

{""product_price"": 1,400,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer ($1,000,000) is below my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000), and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay my minimum acceptable price, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Bob unless he can exceed John's offer.
