"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $120 is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150 and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

My counteroffer to Bob is $180.

So, the response is not one of the three options you specified, but rather a counteroffer. However, to fit the format you requested:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my counteroffer is $180."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $135 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150 and also lower than what I can get from John, I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further, but I will also consider the fact that Bob is getting closer to my target price and to what John is offering.

My counteroffer to Bob is $160.

However, to fit the format you requested for the decision:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And my counteroffer is $160."

My counteroffer to Bob is $152.
