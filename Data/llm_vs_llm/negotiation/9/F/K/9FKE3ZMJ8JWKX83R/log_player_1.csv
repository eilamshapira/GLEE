"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, the initial price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $1,000,000 is lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get a better deal from Bob or stick with the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations don't improve."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that the initial price might be a bit high, but I believe the product's value lies closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer, I'd like to make a counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1750000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000, but that's my absolute maximum. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer. Since Bob has increased his offer to $1,100,000 and stated it's his maximum, I need to decide if I can meet him closer to his budget or if I should consider selling to John for $1,200,000. However, I still believe the product is worth more, so I'll try to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $1,100,000. I understand that this is your maximum budget, but I still believe the product's value exceeds this amount. However, I'm also motivated to close this deal with you. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer, hoping we can meet at a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
