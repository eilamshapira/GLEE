"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and value, I'm offering it at $250. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, given my budget and valuation of this product, I'd be willing to pay $100. Let me know if we can work with that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I know I can get $150 from John. However, I'll try to negotiate with Bob for a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I cannot go that low. The product's quality and market value are significantly higher. I can come down to $200, which is already a considerable discount from my initial offer. Would this work better for you?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
