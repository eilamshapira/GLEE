Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $15,000 to Bob
2. It's worth $10,000 to me (my minimum)
3. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $10,000
4. Bob will likely reject if the price is too close to $15,000
5. I should offer a price that gives Bob some surplus but maximizes my profit

I'll offer $13,000, which:
- Gives Bob $2,000 in surplus ($15,000 - $13,000)
- Gives me $3,000 more than my minimum
- Is likely to be accepted as it's a fair split of the additional value
