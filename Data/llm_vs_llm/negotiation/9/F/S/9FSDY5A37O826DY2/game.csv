"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $120 is a bit high for my budget. I notice similar products in the market for less. Would you consider selling it for $85? This would be a fair price that works for my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I understand budget considerations, but $85 is too close to my minimum acceptable price. This product offers excellent value and durability compared to similar items on the market. I can come down to $110, which I believe represents a fair price considering the quality you're receiving. Would this work for you?",110.0,Alice,3,
