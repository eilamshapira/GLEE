# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $120 is a bit high for my budget. I notice similar products in the market for less. Would you consider selling it for $85? This would be a fair price that works for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
