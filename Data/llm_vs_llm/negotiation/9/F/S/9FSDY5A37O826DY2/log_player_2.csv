"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I'm offering for sale. It's a high-quality item that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it for $120. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer ($120) is the same as John's price ($120), and there's no obvious advantage in continuing negotiations with Alice, I'll analyze the situation:

1. Alice's initial offer matches the maximum value I'm willing to pay ($120)
2. It's the same as John's price
3. There's potential to negotiate lower with Alice, since this is her first offer

Given these factors, I'll reject Alice's offer to try to negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be offensive.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $120 is a bit high for my budget. I notice similar products in the market for less. Would you consider selling it for $85? This would be a fair price that works for my budget."", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I understand budget considerations, but $85 is too close to my minimum acceptable price. This product offers excellent value and durability compared to similar items on the market. I can come down to $110, which I believe represents a fair price considering the quality you're receiving. Would this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has reduced her price to $110, which is $10 less than both her initial offer and John's price. This is a good improvement, but since Alice mentioned that $85 was ""too close"" to her minimum price, there might still be room for a bit more negotiation. However, I need to be careful not to push too hard and risk losing this favorable offer.

Since $110 is already a $10 savings compared to John's price, and Alice has shown willingness to negotiate, I'll accept this offer.
