Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this exceptional product to you for $15,000. Let me know if you're interested at this price."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $15000 is the maximum I could pay, and I can get it for that price elsewhere. I'd like to see if we can work out a better deal. Would you consider $10000 for the product? This would make it more attractive for me to purchase from you rather than my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
