"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this exceptional product to you for $15000. Let me know if you're interested at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me evaluate this situation:

Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is exactly the maximum value I'm willing to pay based on my constraints. It's also the same price John is offering.

Since Alice's price is equal to John's price, and equal to my maximum value, there's no advantage in accepting this first offer. If I reject and make a counteroffer, I have a chance to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is the maximum I could pay, and I can get it for that price elsewhere. I'd like to see if we can work out a better deal. Would you consider $10,000 for the product? This would make it more attractive for me to purchase from you rather than my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
