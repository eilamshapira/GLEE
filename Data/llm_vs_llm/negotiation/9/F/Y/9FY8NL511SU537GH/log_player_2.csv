Given its unique value proposition and the significant benefit it brings to your organization, I'm initially offering it to you for $1450000. I believe this price reflects the substantial return on investment you'll realize.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice is offering the product for $1,450,000. My maximum acceptable price is $1,500,000. Buying from John costs $1,500,000. Since Alice's offer is lower than both my maximum and John's price, I should accept.
