Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it would be a valuable addition to your inventory, and this is a very competitive price."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $15,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation ($12,000) but lower than my guaranteed sale price ($15,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Confident Tone:**  The message implies the product is worth the asking price, potentially influencing Bob's perception of its value."
