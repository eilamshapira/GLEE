"Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1800000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1800000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, which is still a fair price considering the potential value.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000,  demonstrating my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1500000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, the value of this product is firmly above $1250000. I've got another potential buyer who sees its full potential, but I believe in giving you every opportunity. My final offer is $1400000.  This is a decision point for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1300000.  This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
