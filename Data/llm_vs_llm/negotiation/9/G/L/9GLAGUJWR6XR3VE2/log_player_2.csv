(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the offered price of $1,200,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,000,000, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of negotiating a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a price that is close to my maximum budget, but leaves some room for further negotiation.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,100,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000, but it's getting closer. I'm not willing to pay more than $1,000,000, so I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $1,100,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her offer and my previous counteroffer of $900,000. However, I'll also keep in mind that I don't want to exceed my maximum budget of $1,000,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,050,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. At this point, I think I've negotiated as much as I can, and buying from John for $1,000,000 is starting to look like a more attractive option.
