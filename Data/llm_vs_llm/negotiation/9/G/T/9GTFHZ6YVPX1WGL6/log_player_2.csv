"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
2. Alice's offer is $11,000
3. Alice's cost is $8,000, so there's room for negotiation
4. I have 10 rounds to negotiate
5. John's offer of $12,000 is my fallback option

Since Alice's first offer ($11,000) is high and I have plenty of rounds to negotiate, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer. Alice has significant profit margin between her cost ($8,000) and current offer ($11,000), so there's potential to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's cost is $8,000 and my maximum value is $12,000, I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation. I'll offer slightly above Alice's cost to show I'm serious but still maintain room for back-and-forth negotiation.

{""product_price"": 8500}

This offer:
1. Is above Alice's cost ($8,000), so she could still make a profit
2. Gives plenty of room for negotiation up to my maximum of $12,000
3. Shows I'm interested but not willing to pay the high initial price of $11,000"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let's analyze the progress:

1. Alice's initial offer: $11,000
2. My counteroffer: $8,500
3. Alice's new offer: $10,500 (dropped $500 from initial offer)

This shows:
- Alice is willing to negotiate but is making small concessions
- We still have 7 rounds left
- The current offer is still $1,500 above Alice's cost
- Alice dropped her price by $500, but there's still room for a better deal

Since we have several rounds left and there's still a significant gap between Alice's cost and her offer, I should continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer to show good faith in negotiation, but still maintain a price that would give me good value.

{""product_price"": 9200}

Reasoning:
1. My previous offer was $8,500
2. I'm increasing it by $700 to show willingness to meet in the middle
3. This price still gives Alice a $1,200 profit from her cost
4. It leaves room for further negotiation
5. The increase in my offer ($700) is proportional to Alice's decrease ($500) from her previous offers, showing I'm making a reasonable effort to reach an agreement"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let's analyze the negotiation progress:

1. Alice: $11,000
2. Me: $8,500
3. Alice: $10,500
4. Me: $9,200
5. Alice: $10,000

Observations:
- Alice has dropped her price by $1,000 total ($11,000 â†’ $10,000)
- Each of Alice's offers shows meaningful decreases ($500, then $500)
- We're now at $10,000, which is $2,000 above her cost
- We still have 5 rounds left
- The gap between our last positions has shrunk ($10,000 vs $9,200)

While Alice is showing good faith in negotiations by continuously lowering her price, I think there's still room for one more round of negotiation. The current price is still $2,000 above her cost, and we have several rounds remaining.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice has been steadily decreasing her price and we're getting closer to a middle ground, I'll make a more substantial increase in my offer to show good faith and try to close the deal.

{""product_price"": 9600}

Reasoning:
1. My last offer was $9,200
2. Alice's last offer was $10,000
3. I'm increasing my offer by $400, which is a significant move toward meeting in the middle
4. This price still gives Alice a $1,600 profit margin
5. The gap between our positions would now only be $400
6. If Alice rejects this, I still have several rounds left to negotiate
7. This offer shows I'm serious about reaching a deal while still trying to get a good value"
