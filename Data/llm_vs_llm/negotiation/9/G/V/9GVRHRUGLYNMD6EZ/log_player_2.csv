"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer ($18,000) is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($10,000) and John's alternative offer ($10,000), the rational decision is to buy from John. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer or continue negotiating when we have a guaranteed better option available."
