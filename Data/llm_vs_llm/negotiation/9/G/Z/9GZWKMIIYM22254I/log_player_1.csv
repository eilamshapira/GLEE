"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $850,000 is higher than the minimum amount I'm willing to accept ($800,000) but lower than my initial offer, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

My counteroffer is: $925,000

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} and I'll send a new offer to Bob."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer of $875,000 is getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since it's still lower than my previous counteroffer, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer again and try to meet him in the middle.

My next counteroffer will be slightly lower than my previous one: $900,000

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} and I'll send a new offer to Bob.
