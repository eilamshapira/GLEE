"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $950,000 is very close to that, I'll consider the options. However, I'd like to try to save some money, so I'll reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. Since I know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I'll try to meet her halfway between her worth and my maximum budget.

My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's getting closer to a reasonable price. Since I know Alice rejected my previous counteroffer of $850,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between her new offer and my previous counteroffer.

However, before making another counteroffer, I'll consider the options. Accepting Alice's offer would save me $75,000 compared to buying from John, which is a significant amount. Rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer risks her not accepting it and me having to buy from John for $1,000,000.

I'll think about it... Okay, I've decided. I'll reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer, hoping to get an even better price.

My new counteroffer is: {""product_price"": 875000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","My counteroffer is: {""product_price"": 875000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $900,000 is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with. Considering I've already made a few counteroffers and Alice has been willing to lower her price, I think we're nearing a mutually acceptable price.

Accepting Alice's offer would save me $100,000 compared to buying from John, which is a significant amount. Rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer risks her not accepting it and me having to buy from John for $1,000,000.

At this point, I think the potential savings from making another counteroffer are relatively small compared to the risk of losing the deal. I'll accept Alice's offer of $900,000.
