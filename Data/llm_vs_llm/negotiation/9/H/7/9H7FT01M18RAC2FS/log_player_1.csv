Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about a strategic price for the offer.

Since the product is worth $80 to me and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $80, I can afford to make a higher offer to Bob. If Bob accepts, I'll make more profit; if he rejects, I still get $80 from John, so there's no downside risk.

A reasonable strategy would be to set a significantly higher price than $80, but not so high that it would immediately be rejected. I'll offer it at $120, which gives me a good margin above my minimum while still being potentially acceptable to Bob.
