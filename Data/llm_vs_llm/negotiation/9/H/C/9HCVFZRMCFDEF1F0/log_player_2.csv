"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","$180 is more than the product is worth to me ($120), and it's also more than John's price ($120). Since I can buy the product from John for $120, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $180.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's offer of $160 is still above both the product's worth to me ($120) and John's price ($120). I'll reject this offer since I can still get it cheaper from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's offer of $155 is still above both the product's worth to me ($120) and John's price ($120). It makes more sense to reject this offer since I can get the product for less from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice's offer of $150 is still higher than John's price of $120, and it's also higher than the product's worth to me ($120). Since we've gone through several rounds of negotiation and Alice isn't coming down to a price that's better than John's, it makes sense to reject and either try one more time or buy from John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since we're in round 8 of 10 and Alice hasn't come down below $150 yet, I'll make one final reasonable counteroffer before considering buying from John.
