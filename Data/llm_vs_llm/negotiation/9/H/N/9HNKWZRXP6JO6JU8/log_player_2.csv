"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer compared to my alternatives.

Alice is offering the product for $15,000, which is exactly the maximum value I'm willing to pay for it. John is also offering the product for $15,000.

Since both offers are for the same price ($15,000), and this equals my maximum valuation, I'm indifferent between accepting Alice's offer or buying from John. I would save the same amount of money (which is $0 in this case) with either option.
