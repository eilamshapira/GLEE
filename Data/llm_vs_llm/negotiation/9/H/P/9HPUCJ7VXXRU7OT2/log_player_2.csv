"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product available for sale. It's a high-quality item that I believe would be of significant value to you. After careful consideration of market conditions and the product's features, I'd like to offer it to you for $14200. This is a competitive price that reflects the product's true value. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to consider my options carefully here:

1. Alice is offering the product for $14,200
2. John is selling the same product for $15,000
3. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me

Alice's offer is $800 less than John's price, which means I would save money by accepting Alice's offer rather than buying from John. While Alice is making a profit on her offer (since the product is worth $12,000 to her), I'm still getting the product for less than my maximum valuation and less than the alternative option.
