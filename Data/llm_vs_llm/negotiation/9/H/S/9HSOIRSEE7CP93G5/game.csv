"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit higher than I was expecting. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $6000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $6000 is quite a bit below its true value. To find a middle ground, how about we agree on $9000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks Alice, I appreciate the negotiation. $9000 is still a bit steep for me. I am willing to go up to $7500, which is the highest I can go right now. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  It seems we're getting closer. How about we settle at $8500?  That's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",8500.0,Alice,5,
