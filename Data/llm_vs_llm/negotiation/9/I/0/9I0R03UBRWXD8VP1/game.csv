"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $15000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, which is the same price I can get it from another seller. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $6500 for the product.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $6500. I understand that you have a budget in mind, but I'm afraid I need to get a better price for the product. As I mentioned earlier, I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. Considering your interest in the product and your willingness to do business with me, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my initial offer. However, I still need to get a price that reflects the product's true worth.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is still beyond what I can justify spending on this product. As I mentioned, I can purchase the same product from another seller for $8000, which is my maximum budget for this item. To make it worth both our while, I'm willing to offer you $7500, which gives you a reasonable profit while still being within my budget constraints.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $7500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. However, I still need to get a better price for the product. Considering your budget and interest in the product, I'm willing to make another adjustment to my offer. I'll sell the product to you for $10000, which is a significant compromise on my part.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10000, which shows your willingness to find common ground. However, I need to be transparent that I have a firm alternative option to purchase this product from another seller for $8000. That price represents my absolute maximum budget for this item. To give you some incentive to close the deal with me rather than having me go to the other seller, I can offer you $7800. This would be my final offer, as anything higher would simply make it more logical for me to go with the alternative option.",7800.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $7800. I appreciate your transparency about your alternative option and your willingness to negotiate. Considering your firm budget of $8000, I'm willing to meet you at that price. I'll sell the product to you for $8000, which is a fair price considering the product's value.",8000.0,Alice,7,
