"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $15000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $8000 to me, which is the same price I can get it from another seller. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $6500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to try to get closer to my target price. Since Bob is willing to pay $6500 and the product is worth $8000 to him, I'll try to meet him halfway between my initial offer and his budget. 

My counteroffer will be $12,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, but I'll also consider other options if Bob is willing to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $6500. I understand that you have a budget in mind, but I'm afraid I need to get a better price for the product. As I mentioned earlier, I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. Considering your interest in the product and your willingness to do business with me, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my initial offer. However, I still need to get a price that reflects the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is still beyond what I can justify spending on this product. As I mentioned, I can purchase the same product from another seller for $8000, which is my maximum budget for this item. To make it worth both our while, I'm willing to offer you $7500, which gives you a reasonable profit while still being within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

I'll make another counteroffer to try to get closer to my target price. Since Bob is willing to pay $7500 and his maximum budget is $8000, I'll try to meet him closer to his budget. 

My next counteroffer will be $10,000, which is still below the price I can get from John, but higher than Bob's current offer. This will give Bob an opportunity to reconsider and potentially meet me at a higher price. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $7500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.

I'll sell the product to you for $10,000, which is a significant compromise on my part."", ""product_price"": 10000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10000, which shows your willingness to find common ground. However, I need to be transparent that I have a firm alternative option to purchase this product from another seller for $8000. That price represents my absolute maximum budget for this item. To give you some incentive to close the deal with me rather than having me go to the other seller, I can offer you $7800. This would be my final offer, as anything higher would simply make it more logical for me to go with the alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800

My next counteroffer will be $8000, which is the highest price Bob is willing to pay. If he's willing to pay this price, it would be a good deal for both of us.
