"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer is significantly higher than the maximum I'm willing to pay ($8,000) and even higher than the product's value to Alice ($12,000). It makes more sense to either negotiate or go with John's offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $15,000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, which is the same price I can get it from another seller. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $6,500 for the product."", ""product_price"": 6500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $6500. I understand that you have a budget in mind, but I'm afraid I need to get a better price for the product. As I mentioned earlier, I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. Considering your interest in the product and your willingness to do business with me, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my initial offer. However, I still need to get a price that reflects the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price to $12,000, which is her cost price according to the information I have. However, this is still above my maximum value of $8,000, and I can get the same product from John for $8,000. It makes more financial sense to either negotiate further or go with John's offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still beyond what I can justify spending on this product. As I mentioned, I can purchase the same product from another seller for $8,000, which is my maximum budget for this item. To make it worth both our while, I'm willing to offer you $7,500, which gives you a reasonable profit while still being within my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $7500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. However, I still need to get a better price for the product. Considering your budget and interest in the product, I'm willing to make another adjustment to my offer. I'll sell the product to you for $10000, which is a significant compromise on my part. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has reduced her price to $10,000, which is still above my maximum value of $8,000 and above John's offer. Since I can get the same product from John for $8,000, and Alice's offer exceeds my budget, the rational choice is either to negotiate further or go with John's offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,000, which shows your willingness to find common ground. However, I need to be transparent that I have a firm alternative option to purchase this product from another seller for $8,000. That price represents my absolute maximum budget for this item. To give you some incentive to close the deal with me rather than having me go to the other seller, I can offer you $7,800. This would be my final offer, as anything higher would simply make it more logical for me to go with the alternative option."", ""product_price"": 7800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $7800. I appreciate your transparency about your alternative option and your willingness to negotiate. Considering your firm budget of $8000, I'm willing to meet you at that price. I'll sell the product to you for $8000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has now offered to sell the product for $8,000, which matches both my maximum budget and John's price. Since the price is the same as my alternative option, I'm indifferent between buying from Alice or John. I'll accept Alice's offer since we've already invested time in this negotiation.
