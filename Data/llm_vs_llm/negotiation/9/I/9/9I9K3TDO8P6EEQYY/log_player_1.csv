Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this offer:

1. The product is worth at least $10,000 to me
2. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $10,000
3. Since Bob's valuation is unknown, but he might value it higher than $10,000
4. I should set a price higher than my guaranteed $10,000 to maximize potential profit
5. However, I don't want to set it too high and risk losing a good deal

Based on this reasoning, I'll set a moderately aggressive price:

{""product_price"": 15000}"
