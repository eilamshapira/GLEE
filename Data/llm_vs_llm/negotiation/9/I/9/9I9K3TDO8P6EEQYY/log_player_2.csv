"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's price ($15,000), and given that this amount is equal to my maximum valuation, there is no advantage in choosing one over the other. However, since Alice made the effort to negotiate with me, I'll accept her offer as a gesture of good faith.
