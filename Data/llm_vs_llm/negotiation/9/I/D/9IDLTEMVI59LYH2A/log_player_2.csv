"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for a special price. Would you like to buy it for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering the product for $120, while John is willing to sell it for $100. The product is worth no more than $100 to me, so I wouldn't want to pay more than that.

Since I can get the same product from John for $100, which is $20 less than Alice's offer, and also matches the maximum value this product has to me, the rational decision would be to buy from John.
