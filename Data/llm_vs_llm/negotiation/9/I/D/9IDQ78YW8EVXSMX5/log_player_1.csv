Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has tremendous value, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects its worth. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 5000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's far beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $600000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us. My next offer will be $2,000,000. This price is still lower than my initial offer but significantly higher than Bob's offer, leaving room for further negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that my initial price was beyond your budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must say that $600,000 is quite lower than what I had in mind. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I can offer you a better deal, but I need to ensure it's worth my while. Let's meet in the middle - I can offer the product to you for $2,000,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the product's value more accurately."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. However, $2000000 is still quite a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to stretch a bit more and offer $700000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope we can close the deal at this price. Let me know what you think.

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since he's willing to stretch his budget to $700,000, I'll try to meet him closer to the middle but still ensure I'm getting a good deal. My next offer will be $1,500,000. This price is lower than my previous offer but still reflects the product's value and is higher than Bob's current offer, giving us room to negotiate further. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $700,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your efforts to lower the price, but $1500000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $750000 as my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. Please let me know if we can agree on this price.

Since Bob's final offer of $750,000 is still lower than the $1,000,000 that John is willing to pay, and I've already reduced my price significantly in negotiations with Bob, it makes more sense to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. This ensures I get a better price for the product without further prolonging the negotiation process."
