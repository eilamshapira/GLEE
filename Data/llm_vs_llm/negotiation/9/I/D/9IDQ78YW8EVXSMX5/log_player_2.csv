Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that my initial price was beyond your budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must say that $600000 is quite lower than what I had in mind. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I can offer you a better deal, but I need to ensure it's worth my while. Let's meet in the middle - I can offer the product to you for $2000000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the product's value more accurately.
