Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a price to offer Bob that maximizes my earnings while ensuring I don't lose the sale unnecessarily. I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.

Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I need to make a reasonable guess. If I price too high, Bob might reject, and I'll end up with $12,000 from John. If I price too low, Bob might accept, but I'll leave money on the table.

A strategic approach would be to set a price noticeably higher than my $12,000 minimum but not so high that it would likely be rejected. Since I have the $12,000 fallback option, I can afford to be somewhat aggressive in my pricing.
