"Hello Bob, I'm glad you're interested in the product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that I believe reflects its true value. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this is a fair starting point.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but that price point is a little high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $700000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $700000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise and lower my initial price. I hope this new offer is more suitable for you.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  To be honest, I have a budget in mind, and $920000 is a bit beyond what I can comfortably spend. How about we split the difference from our previous offers, and settle at $810000?",810000.0,Bob,4,
