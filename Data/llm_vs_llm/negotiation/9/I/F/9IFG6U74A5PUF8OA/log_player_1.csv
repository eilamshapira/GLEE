Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm glad you're interested in the product.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but that price point is a little high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $700000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $700,000 is lower than what John is willing to pay ($800,000), and it's also lower than the product's value to me, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise and lower my initial price. I hope this new offer is more suitable for you."", ""product_price"": 920000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  To be honest, I have a budget in mind, and $920000 is a bit beyond what I can comfortably spend. How about we split the difference from our previous offers, and settle at $810000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $810,000 is higher than what John is willing to pay ($800,000), I will accept Bob's offer. This way, I can sell the product for a higher price than my alternative option with John."
