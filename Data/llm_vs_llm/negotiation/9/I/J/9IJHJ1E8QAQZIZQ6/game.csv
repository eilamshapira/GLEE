"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest. While I appreciate your offer of $100, I need to be closer to my original price given the true value of this product. I can come down to $120, which I believe is still a great deal considering what this product is worth. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer.",120.0,Alice,3,
