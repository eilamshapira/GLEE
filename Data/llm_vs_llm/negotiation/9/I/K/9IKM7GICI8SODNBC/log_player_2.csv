"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given that Alice's offer is $900,000 and the product is worth up to $1,000,000 to me, it makes sense to try to negotiate for a better price. Alice's cost is $800,000, so there's room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's above Alice's cost but better for me than her initial offer.

{""product_price"": 830000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice has lowered her price from $900,000 to $850,000, which is a good step in the negotiation. This is a $150,000 savings compared to John's price of $1,000,000. However, there might still be room to negotiate since Alice's cost is $800,000.

I'll accept this offer as it represents a good value for me, saving $150,000 compared to my alternative option.
