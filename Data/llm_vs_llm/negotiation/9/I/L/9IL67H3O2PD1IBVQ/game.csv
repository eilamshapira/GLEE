"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $6000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $6000 is far too low. The product holds significant value, and I cannot accept such a steep discount. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $14000.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $14000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer, but I'd like to propose a price of $7000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate you increasing your offer. However, $7000 is still significantly below what I can accept. I'm getting closer to my bottom line. Let's try $13000.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to lower the price. However, $13000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. Considering your previous offers, I'm willing to make one more adjustment to my proposal. I'd like to offer $7500. If we can't meet at this price, I may need to explore other options.",7500.0,Bob,6,
