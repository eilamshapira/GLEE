"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2300000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find $2300000 to be significantly above my budget. Based on my market research and valuation of similar products, I would like to make a counteroffer of $900000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while considering current market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I've done extensive market research, and similar products command a much higher price point. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1900000.  This is a fair offer reflecting the true value.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1900000 is still substantially above what I can justify for this product. To demonstrate my serious interest and commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1050000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects a fair market value for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate that.  However,  we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to consider a price of $1700000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility and significant reductions. While we're making progress, $1700000 is still well above what I can justify. I want to continue moving this negotiation forward, so I'm prepared to offer $1150000. This is very close to my maximum budget and represents a substantial increase from my previous offer. I hope this demonstrates my serious commitment to reaching a deal.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our positions remains significant. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1500000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a very fair price for a product of this caliber. I need a decision from you on this offer, as I have other interested parties.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
