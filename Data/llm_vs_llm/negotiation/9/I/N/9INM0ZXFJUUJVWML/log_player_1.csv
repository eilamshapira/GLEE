"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer significantly above our minimum ($1,500,000). This allows room for negotiation and helps gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence in the product's value can influence Bob's perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing implies a willingness to discuss the price further, encouraging Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find $2300000 to be significantly above my budget. Based on my market research and valuation of similar products, I would like to make a counteroffer of $900000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while considering current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While we want to find a mutually agreeable price, accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. We need to guide the negotiation toward a more reasonable range. We'll provide a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I've done extensive market research, and similar products command a much higher price point. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a fair offer reflecting the true value."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're acknowledging Bob's offer while standing firm on the product's value.  The message emphasizes our research and understanding of the market.
* **Significant Reduction:**  By decreasing our price by $400,000, we're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but not at the cost of a substantial loss.
* **Justification:**  We're giving a reason for our counteroffer, anchoring it to market value, to make it more persuasive. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Educate Bob:**  He may not fully grasp the product's value or market position.
2. **Encourage a Realistic Counter:** By making a significant move ourselves, we encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable counteroffer. 
3. **Maintain Control:** We're still aiming for a price that aligns with our minimum while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1900000 is still substantially above what I can justify for this product. To demonstrate my serious interest and commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1050000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects a fair market value for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased to $1,050,000, it's still significantly below our $1,500,000 reserve price. We need to continue steering the negotiation closer to our target range. Accepting now would mean a considerable loss. We believe we can still bridge the gap, so we'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate that.  However,  we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,700,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** We start by acknowledging Bob's increased offer, showing we recognize his movement.
* **Strategic Compromise:** We're reducing our price by $200,000, which is a significant concession but keeps us above our absolute minimum.
* **Emphasis on Mutuality:**  The phrasing focuses on finding a deal that works well for both parties, not just ""winning"" the negotiation.

This approach aims to:

1. **Maintain Momentum:**  We want to keep the negotiation moving forward and prevent a stalemate.
2. **Test Bob's Flexibility:**  By making another considerable move, we hope to see a similar level of movement from Bob in return.
3. **Avoid Appearing Stubborn:**  While firm on our value, we want to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility and significant reductions. While we're making progress, $1700000 is still well above what I can justify. I want to continue moving this negotiation forward, so I'm prepared to offer $1150000. This is very close to my maximum budget and represents a substantial increase from my previous offer. I hope this demonstrates my serious commitment to reaching a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a critical point. Bob's offer is now at $1,150,000, but it's still substantially below our $1,500,000 guarantee with John.  

While Bob claims this is near his maximum budget, there's a chance he might be willing to go slightly higher. We need to assess if it's worth risking the guaranteed sale to John for a potentially better deal with Bob. 

We'll counter in the next round, but we need to be prepared to walk away and accept John's offer if Bob doesn't show significant movement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our positions remains significant. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,500,000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a very fair price for a product of this caliber. I need a decision from you on this offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  We're making it clear that this is our last offer, adding a sense of urgency.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating our position that this price is fair and not arbitrary.
* **Alternative Option:**  Subtly mentioning ""other interested parties"" (John) reminds Bob we have alternatives if he doesn't agree. 

We are now at a point where we must balance potential gain against the risk of losing the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.  This offer keeps us in the game a little longer while protecting our bottom line."
