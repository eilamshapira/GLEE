"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Based on market research, I know this product is valued at $150. Instead of charging the full market value, I'm offering it to you for $140, which saves you $10 while still providing excellent value. This is a limited-time offer since I already have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase it. Would you like to proceed with this purchase?",140.0,Alice,1,
