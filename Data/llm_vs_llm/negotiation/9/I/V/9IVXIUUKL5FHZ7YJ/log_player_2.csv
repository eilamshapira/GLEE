"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Based on market research, I know this product is valued at $150. Instead of charging the full market value, I'm offering it to you for $140, which saves you $10 while still providing excellent value. This is a limited-time offer since I already have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase it. Would you like to proceed with this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
