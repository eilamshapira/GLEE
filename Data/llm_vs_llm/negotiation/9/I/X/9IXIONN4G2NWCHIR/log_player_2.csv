"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","The product is worth no more than $100 to me. Alice is asking for $150, which is too high. I would rather buy from John for $100 than pay Alice $150.
