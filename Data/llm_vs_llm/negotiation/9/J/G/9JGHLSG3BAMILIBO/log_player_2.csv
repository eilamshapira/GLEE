"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since Alice's offer of $900,000 is actually more than the product's worth to me (no more than $800,000), and definitely more than John's fixed price of $800,000, the rational decision is to reject Alice's offer and buy from John.
