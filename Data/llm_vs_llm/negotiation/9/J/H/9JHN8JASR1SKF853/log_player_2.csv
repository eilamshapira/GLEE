"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer is the same as John's price ($1,200,000), and this is my maximum acceptable price, I should reject and make a counteroffer. By negotiating with Alice, I might be able to get a better price, knowing that the product is worth $1,000,000 to her. If the negotiation doesn't work out, I can always fall back to buying from John at $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than Alice's cost ($1,000,000) but significantly lower than the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000). This gives room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to John's price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,170,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,170,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price from $1,200,000 to $1,170,000, which is a good improvement and saves me $30,000 compared to John's price. However, since there's still a significant gap between her cost ($1,000,000) and this offer, I'll reject and try one more counteroffer. If the negotiation doesn't work out, I can still accept a later offer from Alice or go with John's option.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer to show willingness to negotiate, but still try to get a better deal than $1,170,000. I'll aim for a price that's roughly halfway between my last offer ($1,050,000) and Alice's current offer ($1,170,000).

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price again to $1,150,000, which is $50,000 less than John's price. This is a reasonable offer as it represents a good savings compared to my maximum price ($1,200,000), and the negotiation pattern suggests that further negotiations might yield diminishing returns. I'll accept this offer to secure the savings and avoid the risk of Alice becoming less flexible in future rounds.
