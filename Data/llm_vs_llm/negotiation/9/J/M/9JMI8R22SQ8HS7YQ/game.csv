"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. Let me know if we can discuss this further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $1000000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I am willing to come down to $1400000, which still offers you great value for the product. Please let me know if this works for you.",1400000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand your position, but I need to maintain a certain value for the product. I'm willing to lower my price to $1350000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and should meet you closer to your budget while still reflecting the product's worth. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price. However, I'm still a bit above my desired budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle - how about $1200000? This is the highest I'm comfortable going, and it's also the price I can get it from another seller, so it's a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. I accept your offer of $1200000 for the product. Let's proceed with the transaction.",,Alice,4,AcceptOffer
