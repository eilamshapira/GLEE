"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Since Alice's initial offer of $120 is well above my budget of $80, I see no reason to accept it. Additionally, buying from John for $80 is an option, but I'd like to try negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $100 is still above my budget of $80, but it's lower than her initial offer of $120. This suggests that she's willing to negotiate. I'm not ready to accept $100, as it's still too high for me. Buying from John for $80 is still an option, but I'd like to continue negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer decreased from $120 to $100, I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer of $60 and her current offer of $100. I'll make a counteroffer of $70, which is still within my budget of $80 and shows that I'm willing to compromise.

{""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $90 is getting closer to my budget of $80, but it's still $10 above what I'm willing to pay. I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a mutually agreeable price, but I'm not ready to accept $90. Buying from John for $80 is still a viable option, but I'll try to negotiate a bit more with Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer decreased from $100 to $90, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's closer to my target price. I'll offer $75, which is still within my budget of $80 and shows that I'm willing to compromise. This offer is also closer to Alice's previous offer of $90, so I'm hoping she'll consider it a reasonable counteroffer.

{""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice's new offer of $85 is very close to my budget of $80, but it's still $5 above what I'm willing to pay. At this point, I have to consider that buying from John for $80 is a better option than accepting Alice's offer of $85. Since I can get the product for $80 from John, I don't see a reason to pay $85 to Alice.
