Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Anchoring High:** I'm starting high, but not so high that Bob immediately walks away. I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, so a price just below that allows him to still feel like he's getting a slight deal.
*   **Room to Negotiate:** This price leaves me room to come down if necessary, while still staying well above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** I need to remember that John is waiting with $800,000. I am taking a risk by negotiating with Bob and so I need to be sure to make it worth my while."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is not terrible, but it's still below where I think I can get him. The gap between his $850,000 and his perceived value of $1,000,000 is still large. I will make a counter offer.

I will proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Meeting in the Middle (Slightly Above):** I'm reducing the price from my initial $950,000, but not all the way to the middle of our current positions ($850,000 and $950,000). This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still value the product highly.
*   **Above My Minimum:** $925,000 is still significantly above my $800,000 floor.
*   **Appealing to Bob:** A $925,000 price point leaves Bob with a potential ""profit"" of $75,000 based on his $1,000,000 valuation. This might encourage him to accept.
*   **Leaving Some Room:** I still have a little bit of room to move down if needed, but I'm signaling that I'm getting closer to my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving up, which is a good sign. $875,000 is getting close to an acceptable range, but I still believe I can squeeze out more. Selling to John for $800,000 is a safe option, but I'm not ready to take it yet.

I will make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 910000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Small Incremental Decrease:** I'm only coming down $15,000 this time. This signals that I am approaching my final offer.
*   **Still a Good Profit:** $910,000 is a very healthy profit, well above my $800,000 minimum.
*   **Psychological Effect:** This small reduction might make Bob feel like he's ""winning"" and encourage him to accept. It's close enough to his $875,000 that he might be willing to bridge the gap.
*   **Risk Assessment:** The risk of Bob walking away is increasing, but the potential reward is still worth it.
*   **Alternative Option:** I still have John available as an alternative, but I will hold on to it for a little longer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer, and his latest offer of $887,500 is tempting. However, I believe there's still a little bit more to be gained. It appears Bob is willing to negotiate, so I will try one last time.

I will proceed to the next round with a final counteroffer."

```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Round Number Psychology:** $900,000 is a nice, round number. It's psychologically more appealing than a more specific number and can be seen as a fair price.
*   **Closing the Gap:** This is a minimal decrease from my previous offer of $910,000, signaling that I am very close to my absolute minimum.
*   **Excellent Profit:** $900,000 represents a $100,000 profit above my minimum acceptable price, which is a great outcome.
*   **Walking Away:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will strongly consider accepting his counteroffer. The risk of losing him entirely and being stuck with John's $800,000 becomes too great. This is my final offer before potentially settling. I'm implicitly communicating this as well. I've moved in very small increments recently, which suggests I'm almost at my limit.
*   **The ""Take It or Leave It"" Feel:** By going to a round number and only decreasing by a small amount, it signals that this is a ""take it or leave it"" offer.
*   **Assess:** If he rejects this, I'll re-assess, but the next likely action will be to accept."
