"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering my product for $15000. If you’re interested, let me know—otherwise it will be sold to another buyer. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let's analyze the situation:

1. Alice is offering the product for $15,000
2. John is offering the product for $15,000
3. The product is worth $15,000 to me
4. All prices are exactly the same ($15,000)

Since all prices are identical ($15,000), and this is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, it doesn't matter financially which seller I choose. In this case, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer since she's already engaged in negotiation with me, and it saves the effort of going to another seller.
