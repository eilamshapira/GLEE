Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze the situation first:

- The product is worth $800,000 to both Bob and me
- If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell to John for $800,000
- I want to maximize my earnings
- Since I have a guaranteed $800,000 from John, there's no reason to offer Bob anything less

Since Bob values the product at exactly $800,000, he would be indifferent between accepting and rejecting an $800,000 offer. However, I might be able to get slightly more from Bob if I make an offer just above his valuation.
