"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a truly special item. I'm offering it to you first. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Analyzing the situation:

1. Alice's offer: $9,000
2. John's offer: $10,000
3. Product's worth to me: Up to $10,000

Alice is offering the product for $9,000, which is $1,000 less than what John is charging. Since the product is worth up to $10,000 to me, and I want to save as much money as possible while still getting the product, I should accept Alice's offer.
