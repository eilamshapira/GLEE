"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer is $1,400,000
2. Jhon's fixed price is $1,500,000
3. The product is worth $800,000 to Alice
4. My maximum value is $1,500,000

Alice's initial offer is $1,400,000, which is slightly better than Jhon's price but still very high considering the product is worth $800,000 to her. Since this is only the first round and we have 9 more rounds to negotiate, I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Alice has significant room to lower the price since her value is $800,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's value is $800,000 and her initial offer was $1,400,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower but still provides her with a good profit margin. I'll start with an offer closer to her value to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 950000}

This offer would give Alice a $150,000 profit while saving me a significant amount compared to both her initial offer and Jhon's price. It's low enough to anchor the negotiation at a lower price point, but not so low as to be insulting or unreasonable given her known value of $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's original offer was $1,400,000
2. I countered with $950,000
3. Alice has now come down to $1,350,000
4. We still have 7 more rounds available
5. Alice's value is $800,000

Alice has only reduced her price by $50,000, which is a very small concession considering there's still a huge gap between her cost ($800,000) and her current offer ($1,350,000). She's still seeking a $550,000 profit margin. Given that we have several rounds left and significant room for negotiation, I should reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice only moved down $50,000 from her initial offer, I need to remain firm but show some movement from my previous offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate. Her last offer was $1,350,000 and my previous offer was $950,000. I'll increase my offer but still keep it at a level that gives me significant savings compared to Jhon's price.

{""product_price"": 1050000}

This offer:
1. Shows movement from my previous offer ($100,000 increase)
2. Still gives Alice a substantial profit ($250,000 above her value)
3. Maintains room for further negotiation
4. Is significantly better for me than Jhon's price or Alice's current offer
5. Signals that I won't be making large jumps in price"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let's analyze the progression:
1. Alice: $1,400,000 → $1,350,000 → $1,300,000
2. Me: $950,000 → $1,050,000
3. Pattern: Alice is decreasing by $50,000 each time
4. We have 5 rounds left
5. Current gap: My last offer ($1,050,000) vs. her offer ($1,300,000) = $250,000

Alice is showing consistent but small decreases. While $1,300,000 is better than Jhon's price by $200,000, there's still significant room for negotiation given her $800,000 value. With 5 rounds remaining and seeing that Alice is willing to make concessions, I should continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Looking at the negotiation pattern:
1. Alice has decreased by $50,000 each round
2. I've increased by $100,000 in my last move
3. There's currently a $250,000 gap between our last offers

To show continued willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong position, I'll make another meaningful increase but still keep the price well below Alice's current offer.

{""product_price"": 1150000}

This offer:
1. Represents a $100,000 increase from my last offer
2. Would still give Alice a significant profit ($350,000 above her value)
3. Splits the difference between our last positions more fairly
4. Maintains my position well below Jhon's price
5. Shows I'm willing to make substantial moves while expecting similar movement from Alice"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let's analyze the current situation:

1. Alice's progression: $1,400,000 → $1,350,000 → $1,300,000 → $1,250,000
2. My progression: $950,000 → $1,050,000 → $1,150,000
3. We have 3 rounds left
4. Current offer at $1,250,000 is $250,000 below Jhon's price
5. The gap between our last positions has shrunk to $100,000

Alice is maintaining her $50,000 decrease pattern and we're getting closer. However, with her current offer still giving her a $450,000 profit margin and three rounds remaining, I believe there's still room for a better deal. That said, I need to be more cautious as we're running out of rounds.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","At this critical stage:
1. Only 2 rounds remain after this
2. The gap between our last positions is $100,000 (my $1,150,000 vs her $1,250,000)
3. Alice has been consistently decreasing by $50,000
4. I've been increasing by $100,000

Given the limited remaining rounds and the narrowing gap, I'll make a strategic move closer to Alice's position to try to close the deal:

{""product_price"": 1200000}

This offer:
1. Moves $50,000 higher from my last offer
2. Is only $50,000 below Alice's last offer
3. Still saves $300,000 compared to Jhon's price
4. Gives Alice a very healthy $400,000 profit
5. Shows I'm serious about closing the deal while still maintaining some negotiating room

This is a critical moment - if Alice maintains her pattern of $50,000 decreases, we might be able to meet in the middle in the next round."
