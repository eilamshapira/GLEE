Send your offer to Bob.,"After analyzing this negotiation scenario, I'll make an initial offer to Bob. 

Since the product is worth $10,000 to Bob and only $8,000 to me, there's a $2,000 zone of possible agreement. I want to capture as much of that value as possible while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept.

I'll start with an offer that's reasonably high but not so extreme that it would offend Bob:

{""product_price"": 9,500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 9,200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
