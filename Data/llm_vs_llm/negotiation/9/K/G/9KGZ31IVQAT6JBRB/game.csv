,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $145 is very close to the market price of $150. Since I know you can profitably sell this product for much less, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $110, which still gives you a reasonable profit margin.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective. Considering both our interests, Iâ€™d be willing to offer the product at a price of $135.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for lowering the price, Alice. I appreciate the movement, but $135 is still quite high considering the product's value. I can offer $120, which gives you a solid $20 profit margin while being more reasonable for me.",120.0,Bob,4,
