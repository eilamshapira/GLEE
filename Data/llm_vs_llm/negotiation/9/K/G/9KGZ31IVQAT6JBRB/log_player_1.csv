Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $145 is very close to the market price of $150. Since I know you can profitably sell this product for much less, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $110, which still gives you a reasonable profit margin.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for lowering the price, Alice. I appreciate the movement, but $135 is still quite high considering the product's value. I can offer $120, which gives you a solid $20 profit margin while being more reasonable for me.
