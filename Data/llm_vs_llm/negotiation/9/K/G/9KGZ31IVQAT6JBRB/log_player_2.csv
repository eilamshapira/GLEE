"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and the benefits it brings, I'm offering it to you for $145. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me think about this strategically:

1. Alice is offering $145, which is only $5 less than John's price of $150
2. I know the product is worth $100 to Alice, so there's significant room for negotiation
3. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's no rush to accept this high initial offer
4. Since this is the first round, I should reject and make a counteroffer closer to Alice's cost

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower but still reasonable enough to negotiate from:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $145 is very close to the market price of $150. Since I know you can profitably sell this product for much less, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $110, which still gives you a reasonable profit margin."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your perspective. Considering both our interests, Iâ€™d be willing to offer the product at a price of $135. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this:

1. Alice has reduced the price by $10 (from $145 to $135)
2. This is still $35 above her cost ($100)
3. While it's better than John's price ($150), there's still room for negotiation
4. We've only used 3 rounds out of 10, so there's time to negotiate further
5. Her $10 reduction after my counteroffer suggests she's willing to negotiate

Since there's still significant room for a better deal and plenty of rounds left, I should continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still maintain room for negotiation:

{""message"": ""Thanks for lowering the price, Alice. I appreciate the movement, but $135 is still quite high considering the product's value. I can offer $120, which gives you a solid $20 profit margin while being more reasonable for me."", ""product_price"": 120}"
