"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $17,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and benefits."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer, but my budget is quite limited. Iâ€™m very interested in the product, though. I can offer $11000 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and I can't accept a loss on this transaction. I still want to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot go that low. The product's value and my costs make it impossible for me to sell below $15,500. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's quality."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
