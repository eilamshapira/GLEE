"Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $180. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is out of my budget. How about I offer you $50 for the product instead?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $50 is significantly below the product's value. Given its quality and features, I couldn't go below $150. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I can't go that high. How about we settle at $70 for the product?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is still too low for the value this product offers. I can come down to $135, which is a fair price considering its quality and market value. This is a significant discount from my previous offers. Would you consider this price?",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, $135 is still higher than I can afford. Would you accept $75 for the product?",75.0,Bob,6,
