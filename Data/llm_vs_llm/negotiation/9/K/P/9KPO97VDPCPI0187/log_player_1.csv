"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $180. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is out of my budget. How about I offer you $50 for the product instead? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will send a counteroffer to Bob. $50 is far too low considering the product's value to me is $120, and I know I can get at least that much from John. Let me try to negotiate for a better price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $50 is significantly below the product's value. Given its quality and features, I couldn't go below $150. This is already a considerable reduction from my initial offer. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I can't go that high. How about we settle at $70 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will continue negotiating with Bob. While $70 is higher than his initial offer, it's still well below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Since we still have several rounds left, I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is still too low for the value this product offers. I can come down to $135, which is a fair price considering its quality and market value. This is a significant discount from my previous offers. Would you consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 135}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, $135 is still higher than I can afford. Would you accept $75 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've decided to sell the product to John for $120. Bob's offers have consistently remained well below my minimum acceptable price of $120, only increasing by small amounts ($50 to $70 to $75). Given this pattern and the fact that we're already in round 6, it seems unlikely that Bob will reach a price that would be better than John's guaranteed offer of $120. It's more profitable to take John's offer now rather than continue negotiations that may not lead to a better outcome."
