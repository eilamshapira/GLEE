(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,500 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($10,000) but lower than what I initially offered ($12,000), I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

My counteroffer will be $11,750.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

My counteroffer will be $11,400.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll send my new counteroffer to Bob:
