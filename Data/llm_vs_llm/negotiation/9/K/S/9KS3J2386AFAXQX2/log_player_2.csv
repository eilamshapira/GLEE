"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer is the same as John's price ($12,000), and the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, there's no reason to accept this offer immediately. I should try to negotiate a better price with Alice, knowing I can always fall back to John's offer if needed.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, I'll start with a low but reasonable offer to leave room for negotiation. I'll offer slightly above Alice's value but well below my maximum price.

{""product_price"": 10500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price by $250 from her initial offer, which shows some willingness to negotiate. However, there's still room for negotiation since she's still significantly above her $10,000 value. Since I have several rounds left and John's offer ($12,000) as a backup, I can afford to continue negotiating for a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still maintain a good margin for negotiation. I'll aim for a middle ground between my last offer ($10,500) and Alice's last offer ($11,750).

{""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has come down further to $11,400, which is a significant improvement from her initial $12,000 offer. This is now $600 less than John's price. While we might be able to negotiate further, the price is getting quite reasonable, and there's always a risk that too much pushing could make Alice less willing to negotiate. Given that we've already saved $600 compared to John's offer, I'll accept this offer.
