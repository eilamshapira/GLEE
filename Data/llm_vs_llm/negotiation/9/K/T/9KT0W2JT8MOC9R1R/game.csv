"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your perspective, I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer.

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the market conditions. However, considering the unique value this product brings, I believe it's worth a bit more than your last offer. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. How about $1250000? This price is fair and reflects a significant concession from my side.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
