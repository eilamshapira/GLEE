"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you our premium product at a special price of $1450000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something that will add significant value to your portfolio. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. Alice's offer is $1,450,000
2. John's fixed price is $1,500,000
3. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice
4. My maximum value is $1,500,000

Alice's initial offer of $1,450,000 is only slightly below John's price ($50,000 difference). Since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, there should be significant room for negotiation. In the first round, it makes sense to reject this offer and make a lower counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower but still reasonable given Alice's cost basis.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe your asking price is quite high considering market conditions. Given that I have other options available, I would like to offer $1,150,000 for the product. This represents a healthy profit margin and is a fair value for both parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the market conditions. However, considering the unique value this product brings, I believe it's worth a bit more than your last offer. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. How about $1250000? This price is fair and reflects a significant concession from my side. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. Alice has significantly reduced the price from $1,450,000 to $1,250,000 (a $200,000 reduction)
2. This is $250,000 less than John's fixed price
3. The price is $250,000 above Alice's cost ($1,000,000)
4. There's still room for negotiation, but Alice has shown significant willingness to compromise

While this is a much better offer, we're only in round 3 of 10 possible rounds, and Alice has already shown willingness to make substantial concessions. Given that there's still room for negotiation and we're early in the process, I'll reject this offer and try for a slightly better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice moved significantly from her initial position and showed willingness to negotiate, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that splits the difference between our last positions.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your significant movement on the price, Alice. You've shown good faith in negotiating, and I'd like to do the same. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This represents a fair deal for both of us, giving you a solid profit margin while still being significantly below alternative options available to me."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
