"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $2500000. I believe it's a fair price, considering the product's potential. I'm open to negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your product, I must be transparent that your asking price of $2500000 is significantly above my budget and the market value I've researched. I have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product, which allows me some budget flexibility while still being competitive. I look forward to your thoughts on this counteroffer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your transparency and for sharing your research on the market value. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must consider the value of the product to me, which is significantly higher than $1200000. Given that you mentioned you have some budget flexibility, I'm willing to make a concession and offer the product to you for $2000000. This price is still competitive, considering the product's unique features and potential. I'm open to further negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this counteroffer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2000000 is still considerably above what makes financial sense for me. As I mentioned, I have John's offer at $1500000, which is actually my absolute maximum budget for this purchase. To make it worth my while to choose you over John, I'd need a better price. I can offer $1350000, which gives you a premium over what I'd be willing to pay elsewhere while still keeping within my constraints. This represents the upper range of what I can reasonably justify for this product. How does that sound?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for sharing your constraints and for being transparent about your maximum budget. I appreciate your willingness to offer a premium to do business with me. Considering your budget and the value of the product to me, I'm willing to make a significant concession and offer the product to you for $1475000. This price is very close to my minimum acceptable value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm open to further negotiations, but I want to emphasize that I'm getting close to my limit. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this counteroffer.",1475000.0,Alice,5,
