Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $2,500,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your product, I must be transparent that your asking price of $2500000 is significantly above my budget and the market value I've researched. I have another seller, John, who's offering the same product for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a reasonable agreement. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product, which allows me some budget flexibility while still being competitive. I look forward to your thoughts on this counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

My reasoning is that Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is below the minimum value of the product to me, which is $1,500,000. I also have the option to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is a better deal than Bob's offer. However, I want to try to negotiate with Bob further to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I will send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your transparency and for sharing your research on the market value. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. However, I must consider the value of the product to me, which is significantly higher than $1,200,000. Given that you mentioned you have some budget flexibility, I'm willing to make a concession and offer the product to you for $2,000,000. This price is still competitive, considering the product's unique features and potential. I'm open to further negotiations, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2000000 is still considerably above what makes financial sense for me. As I mentioned, I have John's offer at $1500000, which is actually my absolute maximum budget for this purchase. To make it worth my while to choose you over John, I'd need a better price. I can offer $1350000, which gives you a premium over what I'd be willing to pay elsewhere while still keeping within my constraints. This represents the upper range of what I can reasonably justify for this product. How does that sound?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

I also have the option to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is a better deal than Bob's offer. However, I want to try to negotiate with Bob further to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Since Bob mentioned that $1,500,000 is his absolute maximum budget, I will try to get closer to that price in my next counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for sharing your constraints and for being transparent about your maximum budget. I appreciate your willingness to offer a premium to do business with me.
