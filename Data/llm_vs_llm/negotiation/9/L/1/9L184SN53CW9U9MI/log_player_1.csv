Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, my budget is limited. I would like to offer $1200000 for it, considering my constraints and the alternatives available. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the minimum value the product is worth to me, and I have the option to sell it to John for the same price, I don't see a benefit in accepting Bob's offer over selling to John. However, I also don't want to give up the potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value you're placing, I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1300000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the alternatives available to me.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's new offer of $1,300,000 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it's still lower than what I was hoping to get. Since Bob has increased his offer, it shows that he's interested in the product and willing to negotiate. I'll reject his current offer and try to get a better price.
