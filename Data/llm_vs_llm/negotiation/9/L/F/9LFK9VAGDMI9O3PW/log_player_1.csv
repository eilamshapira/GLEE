Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product to offer you. Based on its quality and market value, I'm offering it for $180. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While the product looks interesting, $180 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to buy it for $80.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob since $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I can still negotiate for a better price than John's $120 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $80 is too low considering the product's value. I can come down from my initial price, but I couldn't go below $150. Would this work better for you?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I understand it has value, but $150 is still a stretch for me.  I could go up to $100.  Let me know if that's something you can consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob's offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and his incremental increase from $80 to $100 suggests he's unlikely to reach $120 or above, I'll take the guaranteed $120 from John."
