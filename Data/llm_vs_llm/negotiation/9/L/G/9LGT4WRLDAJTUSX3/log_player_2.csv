"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you will find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Looking at this situation, Alice is offering the product for $200, but it's only worth up to $80 to me. John is willing to sell the same product for $80, which is the maximum I value it at.

Since Alice's price ($200) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's alternative price ($80), the best decision is clear.
