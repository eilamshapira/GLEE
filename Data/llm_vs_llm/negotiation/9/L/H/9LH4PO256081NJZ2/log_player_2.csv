(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I should definitely not accept Alice's offer, since the price is $150, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I should consider my options and see if I can get a better deal. Buying from John is also not a good option, since it's the same price. So I will reject the offer and try to get a better deal.
