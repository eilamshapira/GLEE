"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Given that the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $12,000, Alice's offer of $18,000 is clearly too high. I should either make a counteroffer to Alice or buy from John.

Since I have the option to buy from John at any time for $12,000, there's no reason to accept any offer from Alice that's higher than $12,000. I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still provides room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": $10,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has reduced her price from $18,000 to $16,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but her offer is still higher than John's price of $12,000. Since I can get the product from John for $12,000 at any time, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $16,000.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice has dropped her price by $2,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. I'll increase my previous offer a bit but still keep it well below the $12,000 maximum I'm willing to pay.

{""product_price"": $11,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I see that Alice is gradually coming down in her offers ($18,000 → $16,000 → $14,000), but her current offer of $14,000 is still higher than John's fixed price of $12,000. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible while getting the product, and I know I can buy from John for $12,000 at any time, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has been reducing her price by $2,000 each round, she seems willing to continue negotiating. I'll slightly increase my counteroffer to show good faith in the negotiation while still aiming to get a better price than John's $12,000.

{""product_price"": $11,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's offer is now $13,000, which is still $1,000 more than John's price of $12,000. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, and I can buy from John for $12,000 at any time, I'll reject Alice's current offer and continue negotiating.

Alice has been consistently lowering her price, so there's a good chance she might come down below $12,000 in the next rounds.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice continues to lower her price, so I'll maintain my strategy. I'll slightly increase my offer to show I'm negotiating in good faith, but keep it below John's price.
