Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. Since the product is worth $10,000 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price (John), I have nothing to lose by making a higher offer to Bob. I should set a price significantly higher than $10,000 to maximize my potential profit, while still keeping it somewhat reasonable to have a chance that Bob might accept.
