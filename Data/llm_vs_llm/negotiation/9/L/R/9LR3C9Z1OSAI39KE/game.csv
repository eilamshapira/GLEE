"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $25000. This is a competitive price for the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in making this purchase?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $5000. Is this something we can work with?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5000 is significantly below the product's value. While I can be flexible on the price, I need to ensure it reflects the true worth of the product. I can reduce my initial offer to $20000, which is a considerable discount. This price better represents the product's quality and market value. Would you consider this revised offer?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $20000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7000, which is a significant jump from my last offer. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $7000, which shows you're serious about this negotiation. However, I need to be transparent - I have another buyer offering $15000 for this product. Given this, I can come down to $17500, which is a substantial reduction from my previous offer. This price still gives you great value while being fair to both parties. Would you be able to meet me at this price?",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you have another offer, but $17500 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to stretch a bit more and offer $8000. This is my best offer at the moment, considering my financial constraints. Can we find a way to make this work?",8000.0,Bob,6,
