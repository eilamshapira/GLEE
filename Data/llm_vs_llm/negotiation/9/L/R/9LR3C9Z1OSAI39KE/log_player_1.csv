"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $25,000. This is a competitive price for the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $5000. Is this something we can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$5,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 (as evidenced by John's standing offer). I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but I'll lower my initial price to show some flexibility in negotiation while still maintaining a profitable margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is significantly below the product's value. While I can be flexible on the price, I need to ensure it reflects the true worth of the product. I can reduce my initial offer to $20,000, which is a considerable discount. This price better represents the product's quality and market value. Would you consider this revised offer?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $20000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7000, which is a significant jump from my last offer. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $7,000 is still less than half of John's guaranteed offer of $15,000. While Bob is showing some movement upward, the gap is still too large. I'll make another counteroffer, but if we can't get closer to a reasonable price soon, I'll need to consider taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $7,000, which shows you're serious about this negotiation. However, I need to be transparent - I have another buyer offering $15,000 for this product. Given this, I can come down to $17,500, which is a substantial reduction from my previous offer. This price still gives you great value while being fair to both parties. Would you be able to meet me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you have another offer, but $17500 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to stretch a bit more and offer $8000. This is my best offer at the moment, considering my financial constraints. Can we find a way to make this work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Given that Bob's latest offer of $8,000 is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer of $15,000, and Bob's incremental increases suggest he's unlikely to reach a price near $15,000, it makes the most business sense to accept John's offer. We've had several rounds of negotiation, but the gap between our positions remains too large to bridge, and continuing the negotiation would likely not lead to a better outcome than John's offer."
