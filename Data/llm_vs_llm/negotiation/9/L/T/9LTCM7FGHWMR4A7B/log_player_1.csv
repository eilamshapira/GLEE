"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, hoping to get a good price.  Since I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, I'm leaving room for negotiation, but still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price, but still aiming for a significant profit. Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not acceptable. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm willing to drop the price to $1,000,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, as it covers the product's value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm running out of time and Bob is not budging on his price. While I would prefer to sell to Bob, it's getting risky to keep negotiating. I'm going to sell to John, securing a guaranteed profit."
