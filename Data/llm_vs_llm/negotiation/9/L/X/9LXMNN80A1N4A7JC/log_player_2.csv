"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","The price Alice is offering is $140, which is more than the product is worth to me ($100) and also more than John's fixed price of $100. It doesn't make sense to accept this offer.

I should either reject and make a counteroffer, or simply buy from John. Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum value ($100), I can guarantee getting the product without further negotiation by buying from him. However, I might be able to get a better deal from Alice through negotiation.

Let me reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has lowered her price to $130, which is still above my maximum value ($100) and higher than John's price ($100). There's no reason to accept this offer.

I'll reject and try another counteroffer. Since we still have several rounds left, I can continue negotiating with Alice to try to get a better price than John's $100.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved from $140 to $130, she's showing some flexibility. I'll increase my offer slightly but still try to get a price better than John's $100.

I'll reject and continue negotiating since Alice is moving in the right direction.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6

Since Alice has reached her cost price, she may not go much lower. However, we still have a few rounds left, so I'll reject once more to see if she's willing to go below her cost.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has already come down to her cost price of $120, I'll make one final reasonable offer before potentially going with John's option.
