"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest, but $1200000 is too low for this unique product. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $1700000. Let me know your thoughts!",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1700000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1400000. Let's get closer to a deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget considerations, but I can't go as low as $1400000. How about we find common ground at $1600000? I believe thatâ€™s a fair price for this exclusive product. Looking forward to your response!",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $1600000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1500000.  This is my final offer, as that's my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
