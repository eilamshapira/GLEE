"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product and I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start by making a high offer. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially settle on a higher price than if I started with a lower offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and also lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($1,200,000), and I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate, I will reject Bob's offer.

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer, in an attempt to meet Bob somewhere in the middle and maximize my earnings.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $500,000 and my initial offer was $2,500,000, I'll try to find a middle ground while still being mindful of my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial offer but still reflects the value I believe the product holds.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's new offer of $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it shows that he is willing to increase his offer. Since I have 6 rounds left to negotiate, I will reject Bob's offer again and try to bring him closer to my minimum acceptable price.

I will proceed to the next round and make another counteroffer that is lower than my previous one but still above Bob's current offer, in an attempt to meet him at a price that is more favorable to me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's latest offer was $750,000 and my previous counteroffer was $2,000,000, I'll try to make a more significant concession to show that I'm willing to negotiate, while still aiming to get a price that's closer to my initial valuation. I'll reduce my counteroffer by a larger amount this time, but still keep it above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's new offer of $1,250,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and it's actually higher. Considering that I have 4 rounds left to negotiate, but the difference between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price is only $50,000, I think it's a good opportunity to close the deal.

Accepting Bob's offer would give me a slightly better price than selling to John, and it would also avoid the risk of further negotiations not yielding a better result.
