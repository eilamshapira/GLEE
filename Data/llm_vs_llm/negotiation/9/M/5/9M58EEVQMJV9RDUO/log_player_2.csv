"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer of $2,500,000 is more than twice the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,000,000), it's not a good deal for me. Additionally, I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is a better deal.

However, I'd like to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start by making a relatively low counteroffer. I'll offer $500,000, which is half of my maximum budget of $1,000,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $2,000,000 is still significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's a slight improvement from her initial offer of $2,500,000, it's still not a good deal for me.

I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate a better price. Since Alice rejected my previous counteroffer of $500,000, my next counteroffer will be slightly higher to show that I'm willing to compromise.

However, for now, I'll just reject the offer and wait for the next round to make another counteroffer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice rejected my previous counteroffer of $500,000, I'll increase my offer by $250,000 to show that I'm willing to negotiate. My new counteroffer will be $750,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,500,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000, but it's getting closer. However, I'm not willing to pay $500,000 more than my budget, especially when I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.

I'll reject Alice's offer again, but I'll also consider the fact that we're halfway through the negotiation rounds. My next counteroffer will need to be more strategic.

For now, I'll just reject the offer and prepare for the next round.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's offer is $1,500,000 and my maximum budget is $1,000,000, I'll try to meet her halfway. My new counteroffer will be $1,250,000, which is still below my maximum budget but shows that I'm willing to compromise.
