Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $10,000, I need to decide whether to accept, reject and counter, or sell to John.

Since my minimum value is also $10,000, accepting Bob's offer would be the same as selling to John. However, there's a chance Bob values the product higher than that. Therefore, I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000}"

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Okay, Bob has offered $11,000. This is better than selling to John for $10,000. However, there's still a chance he'd pay more. I'll take the risk and try for a slightly higher price, aiming for the best possible outcome.
