"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1500000 is significantly above what I can justify for this purchase. I have another seller offering the same product for $1200000, which is my maximum budget for this item. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a middle ground. Would you consider $1000000 for the product? This would allow me some budget flexibility while hopefully still being acceptable for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
