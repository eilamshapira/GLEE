"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it can greatly benefit you. To start, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to evaluate this offer carefully. Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000, which is $300,000 more than the maximum value of $1,200,000 that the product is worth to me. I also have the option to buy from John for exactly $1,200,000.

Since Alice's offer exceeds the product's value to me, and I have a guaranteed alternative at my maximum valuation, I should reject Alice's offer and either make a counteroffer or buy from John directly.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,500,000 is significantly above what I can justify for this purchase. I have another seller offering the same product for $1,200,000, which is my maximum budget for this item. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,000,000 for the product? This would allow me some budget flexibility while hopefully still being acceptable for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
