Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a strong initial offer to see what Bob's perception of the product's value might be. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $900,000 is above my fallback, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's offer indicates interest, but I'm willing to push a bit further before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1100000}

Bob, your offer tells me you see value in this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This price reflects the unique nature of what I'm offering."
