"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $1,500,000
2. Alice's offer is $1,200,000, which is $300,000 less than my maximum value
3. Jhon's fixed price is $1,500,000
4. I could try to negotiate with Alice for an even lower price by making a counteroffer

Since Alice's current offer ($1,200,000) is significantly below my maximum value and Jhon's price, it would be reasonable to reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try to get an even better deal. Even if the negotiation doesn't go well, I can always fall back to Alice's current offer or Jhon's offer later.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's $1,200,000 but still reasonable to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 900000}

This counteroffer of $900,000:
1. Is significantly lower than Alice's offer ($300,000 less)
2. Leaves room for negotiation to potentially meet in the middle
3. Would save me even more money if accepted
4. If rejected, I can still fall back to Alice's previous offer of $1,200,000 or Jhon's $1,500,000 as alternatives"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Let me analyze Alice's new offer:

1. Alice has reduced her price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This is $400,000 less than Jhon's price ($1,500,000)
3. My previous counteroffer of $900,000 was rejected
4. The gap between her current offer ($1,100,000) and my last offer ($900,000) is $200,000

This is a good offer as:
1. Alice has moved significantly from her initial position
2. The price is well below my maximum value
3. The risk of continuing negotiation might not be worth the potential additional savings
4. We might end up going back and forth without much more significant movement

Given this analysis, I think it's wise to accept this offer. We've achieved a good price that saves $400,000 compared to Jhon's price.
