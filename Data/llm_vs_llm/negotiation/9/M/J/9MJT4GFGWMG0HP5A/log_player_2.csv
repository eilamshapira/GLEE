"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2300000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $2,300,000. That's significantly higher than my maximum valuation.
