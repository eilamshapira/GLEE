"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I think $15000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000, considering the market value and quality of the product. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to negotiate further.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $8000 is below my minimum acceptable price for this product. Given its value and quality, I can offer it to you for $13500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it represents a fair price for both parties.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for reducing the price to $13500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. Considering my budget and the market value, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. I believe this is a reasonable price, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I may need to explore other options.",9500.0,Bob,4,
