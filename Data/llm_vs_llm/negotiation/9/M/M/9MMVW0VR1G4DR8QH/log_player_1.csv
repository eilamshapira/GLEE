Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal if we can meet at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 (which is what John is offering). Bob's offer would result in a loss for me. In the next round, I'll propose a more moderate price reduction from my initial offer to show flexibility while maintaining a profitable position."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 is significantly below the product's value. While I'm willing to be flexible from my initial price, I need to ensure the price reflects the product's true worth. I can offer it for $1,700,000, which is a $300,000 reduction from my initial offer. This price better represents the product's value and quality, while still providing you with a good investment opportunity."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the reduction in price from your initial offer. However, $1700000 is still above my budget for this product. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to meet you halfway. I'd like to propose a price of $1000000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll continue negotiating. Bob has shown willingness to increase his offer by $200,000, which is a positive sign. However, his current offer of $1,000,000 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000. Since Bob has demonstrated flexibility and we still have several rounds remaining, I'll make another counteroffer to try to reach a price above $1,200,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and increase your offer. Your movement shows good faith, but I must be transparent - I have another buyer offering $1,200,000 for the product. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Given this context, I can reduce my price to $1,450,000, which is a significant drop from my previous offer. This price point would make it worthwhile for me to sell to you rather than the other buyer, while still providing you with excellent value for the product."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your transparency about the other buyer and the reduction in price. However, $1450000 is still above what I'm willing to pay. Considering the other buyer's offer is $1200000, I'd like to propose a price of $1100000. This is a serious offer, and I'm willing to finalize the deal at this price. I believe it's a fair compromise, given the product's value to me and the other buyer's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've decided to sell to John. While Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, his latest offer of $1,100,000 is still $100,000 below John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000. Given that we've gone through several rounds of negotiation and Bob's offers are still below John's price, it seems unlikely that Bob will exceed $1,200,000. It's more prudent to take John's certain offer of $1,200,000 rather than risk further negotiations that might not yield a better result."
