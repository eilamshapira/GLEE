"Hi Alice, while I appreciate the value of the product, your starting price is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and offer. While I recognize you're looking for a good deal, $1000000 is significantly below its true value. Could you consider $1800000? I'm confident this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $1800000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000. This is my best offer considering my budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable figure.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value your initial interest and believe we can still make a deal.  Would you be willing to consider $1600000? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your transparency and willingness to negotiate. However, $1600000 is still beyond my budget. Given the circumstances, I'm prepared to offer $1150000 as my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to consider other options. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
