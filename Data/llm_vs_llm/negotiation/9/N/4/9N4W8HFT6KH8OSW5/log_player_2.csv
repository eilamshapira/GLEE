"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I notice that Alice's offer is $1,500,000, which is actually higher than the product's worth to me (which is no more than $1,000,000). This offer doesn't make economic sense for me to accept since I'd be paying more than the product's value to me.

John is offering the same product for $1,000,000, which matches the maximum I'm willing to pay. Since there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower counteroffer, and continuing negotiations takes time and effort, the rational choice is to go with John's guaranteed offer.
