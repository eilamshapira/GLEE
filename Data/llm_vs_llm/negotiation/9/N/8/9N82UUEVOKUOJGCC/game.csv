"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, but $1000000 is below the product's value to me. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to make a concession. I'll offer the product to you for $2200000, which is still a premium price but closer to what you're looking for. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",2200000.0,Alice,3,
