"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. Based on my market research, comparable products are selling for around $7500. I'd like to offer you $7500 for the product. This would allow me to purchase it immediately rather than continuing to shop around for other options.",7500.0,Bob,2,
