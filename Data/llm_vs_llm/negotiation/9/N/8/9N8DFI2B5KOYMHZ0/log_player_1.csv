Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. Based on my market research, comparable products are selling for around $7500. I'd like to offer you $7500 for the product. This would allow me to purchase it immediately rather than continuing to shop around for other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
