"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $109. It's a great product, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a fair price for it. Let me know if this works for you!",109.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer of $109. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I was thinking that since the product is worth $100 to you, perhaps we could meet at that price? I'm very interested in the product and believe $100 is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",100.0,Bob,4,
