I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price. Since Bob is interested in the product, I'll try to meet him halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. 

My counteroffer: $109"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer of $109. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I was thinking that since the product is worth $100 to you, perhaps we could meet at that price? I'm very interested in the product and believe $100 is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.

Since Bob's offer is the same price that John is willing to pay, and I don't have to go through any further negotiation, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $100. This way, I can ensure a sale at a price that meets my minimum requirement without any further risk or uncertainty."
