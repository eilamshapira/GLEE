"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and Alice's offer is $119, which is very close to my maximum budget, I will consider my options carefully.

Given that Alice's initial offer is already at $119, which is just $1 less than what I can get from John, I don't see a significant advantage in accepting this offer immediately, especially considering that Alice might be willing to negotiate further.

Therefore, my decision is to reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer, hoping to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $119, and I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than her initial price, but still reasonable considering the product's value to me.

My counteroffer will be $90, which is lower than Alice's offer but still within a range that could be considered acceptable for both parties, given that the product is worth $100 to Alice.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $109. It's a great product, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a fair price for it. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has made a counteroffer of $109, which is $10 lower than her previous offer of $119. This shows that she is willing to negotiate and compromise on the price.

Considering my budget and the fact that I want to save as much money as possible, $109 is still a bit higher than I would like to pay. However, it's getting closer to a price that I would be comfortable with.

Before making a decision, I'll consider the options:

1. Accepting the offer of $109 would get me the product, but it's still $19 more than what Alice is willing to sell it for ($100), and only $11 less than what John is offering ($120).
2. Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer could potentially lead to a better price, but it also risks Alice not being willing to negotiate further.
3. Buying from John for $120 is still an option, but it's the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I'd rather try to get a better deal from Alice if possible.

Given these considerations, I think it's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if we can meet at a price that's more comfortable for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I will make another counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground that works for both Alice and me. 

My next counteroffer will be $100, which is exactly what the product is worth to Alice, indicating that I'm willing to meet her at her minimum acceptable price if she's willing to sell it to me."
