"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $115 is a bit high for me. Given that similar products are available in the market, would you consider selling it for $105? This would still give you a good profit margin, and I'd be happy to complete the purchase right away.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product is worth more than $105. Let's meet in the middle at $110. This way, we both get a fair deal. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
