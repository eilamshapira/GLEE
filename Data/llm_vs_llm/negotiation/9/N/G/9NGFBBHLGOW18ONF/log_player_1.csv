# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $115 is a bit high for me. Given that similar products are available in the market, would you consider selling it for $105? This would still give you a good profit margin, and I'd be happy to complete the purchase right away. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
