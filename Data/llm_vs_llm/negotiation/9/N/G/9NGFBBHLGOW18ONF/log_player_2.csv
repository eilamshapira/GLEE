"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $115. It's a great value and I think you'll be very happy with it. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:
1. The product is worth up to $120 to me
2. Alice's offer is $115
3. John's fixed price is $120
4. Alice's cost is $100, so there's room for negotiation

Since Alice's offer ($115) is already better than John's price ($120), it's a decent offer. However, knowing that Alice's cost is $100, there might be room to negotiate for a better price. It's worth trying to make a counteroffer since I won't lose the option to accept the $115 offer or buy from John later.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that leaves room for negotiation while still being profitable for Alice:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $115 is a bit high for me. Given that similar products are available in the market, would you consider selling it for $105? This would still give you a good profit margin, and I'd be happy to complete the purchase right away."", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product is worth more than $105. Let's meet in the middle at $110. This way, we both get a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the new situation:
1. Alice has moved down from $115 to $110, showing willingness to negotiate
2. The new price ($110) is significantly better than John's price ($120)
3. While there might still be room to negotiate further (given Alice's cost of $100), we risk Alice becoming frustrated and sticking to a higher price
4. A $10 reduction from her initial offer is quite reasonable

Given that:
- The current offer is already $10 less than my maximum value ($120)
- It's $10 better than John's alternative
- We've achieved a good middle ground between Alice's initial offer and my counteroffer
- Further negotiation might risk losing this good deal
