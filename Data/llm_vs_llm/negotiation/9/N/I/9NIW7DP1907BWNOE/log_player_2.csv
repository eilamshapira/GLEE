Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your interest. That said, considering the product's premium quality, I'm willing to adjust slightly from my previous offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $12,500 is very close to my maximum budget of $12,000, and it's only $500 more than what I can get the product for from John. Considering this, I think it's not worth risking further negotiation, as I might not get a better deal from Alice.
