Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider how to maximize my profit from selling this product. The product is worth at least $10,000 to me, and I know I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 (John) if Bob rejects my offer.

Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I need to make a strategic decision. If I price too high, Bob might reject it and I'll end up with $10,000 from John. If I price too low, I might leave money on the table.

A reasonable approach would be to offer Bob a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value, but not so high that it's immediately rejected.
