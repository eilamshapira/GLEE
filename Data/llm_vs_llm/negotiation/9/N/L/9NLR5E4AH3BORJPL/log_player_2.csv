"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that you might be interested in. Given its value and demand, I'm offering it to you for just $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer of $120 is at the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and I can get the same product from John for the same price, I don't see any benefit in accepting Alice's offer over buying from John. However, rejecting Alice's offer and then buying from John is essentially the same as directly buying from John, as I've already established that Alice's offer is not more favorable than John's. Therefore, the most straightforward decision, given the circumstances, is to reject Alice's offer and then buy from John, but since the outcome is the same, I will directly choose to buy from John as it simplifies the process.
