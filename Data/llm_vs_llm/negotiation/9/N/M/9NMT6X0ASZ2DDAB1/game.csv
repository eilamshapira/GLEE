"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and lower the price to $130.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the revised offer, Alice. However, $130 is still above what I can afford. I'm really interested in this product and would like to propose $75. Would that work for you?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to increase your offer. However, $75 is still below my expectations. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer, but a bit higher then that. Let's discuss a price of $107.",107.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, and I appreciate that. However, $107 is still above my budget. I can stretch to $80, which is my max. Can we make a deal at that price?",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to get a bit closer to my target price. Let's discuss a price of $110. If we can't meet at this price, I may need to consider other options.",110.0,Alice,7,
