Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 8000}

I'll offer the product at $8,000 because:
1. This is exactly what Bob values the product at
2. If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell to John for the same amount
3. Since $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, there's no benefit in offering a lower price
4. Offering a higher price would likely lead to rejection, and I wouldn't gain any additional profit since I would then sell to John for $8,000"
