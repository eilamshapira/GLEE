Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering to sell you this product. It's a truly unique item. I'm willing to let it go for $1,000,000."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a very high price. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $600000 for it.  It's a significant discount, but it's the highest I can go right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Okay, Bob's offer of $600,000 is too low. I have to get at least $800,000. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""message"": ""I'm not able to sell for that amount. I'll make a counteroffer.""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I can't go that low. Considering the value of the item, I'm willing to come down to $950,000."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $950000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750000?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Hmm, $750,000 is better than $600,000, but still below my minimum of $800,000. I could try to negotiate further, but I'm not sure how much lower Bob will go. Selling to John for $800,000 is starting to look appealing. I will reject Bob's offer and sell the product to John.
