Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. I know my minimum acceptable price is $120 (what John will pay)
2. Bob's true valuation is unknown to me
3. If I price too high, Bob might reject and I'll have to sell to John for $120
4. If I price too low, I might leave money on the table
5. A reasonable strategy would be to price somewhat higher than my minimum
