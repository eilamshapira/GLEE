"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and Alice's offer is $180, which is above my budget, I will reject Alice's offer. Additionally, since I have the option to buy the product from John for $120, which is within my budget, I don't need to consider accepting Alice's offer or buying from her at a later time. My decision is to buy from John directly as it fits my budget perfectly.
