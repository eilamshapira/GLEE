"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations if you have a different valuation in mind.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I think the product is great, but I believe $12000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd like to counter with $10000. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11500, considering its value and uniqueness. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $11500 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we settle at $10500? I think this is a fair compromise given the value of the product to me. Let me know if this works for you!",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your willingness to compromise. I appreciate your offer of $10500. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,5,
