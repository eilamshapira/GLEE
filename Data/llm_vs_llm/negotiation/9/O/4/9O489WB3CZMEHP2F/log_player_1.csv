Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations if you have a different valuation in mind."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I think the product is great, but I believe $12000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd like to counter with $10000. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I will reject Bob's offer of $10,000 because it is still below what I believe the product is worth, and I have the safety net of selling to John for $8,000 if negotiations with Bob do not meet my minimum requirements. I will proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer to Bob. 

My counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500, considering its value and uniqueness. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 11500}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $11500 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we settle at $10500? I think this is a fair compromise given the value of the product to me. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will reject Bob's offer of $10,500 because, although it is closer to my desired price, I still believe the product is worth more. Given that Bob is willing to negotiate and increase his offer, I think there's still room for a better compromise. I will proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer to Bob.

My counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your willingness to compromise. I appreciate your offer of $10,500. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
