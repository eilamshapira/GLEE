"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $250 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. I've found similar products in the market for much less. I would be willing to pay $75 for it. Let me know if this works for you.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. However, $75 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept for this product. I understand that you've found similar products in the market for less, but this product has unique features that set it apart. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $220. Let me know if this works for you.",220.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price and understand this product has unique features. However, $220 is still well above my budget. I can increase my previous offer to $85. This is a fair price considering market alternatives, and I would like to do business with you if we can find a middle ground.",85.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $85. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $200. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's unique features and my costs. Let me know if this works for you.",200.0,Alice,5,
