"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you this unique product for $121. If this offer works for you, let’s close the deal. If not, I’ll be selling it to another buyer for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $121. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $121
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $121
3. John is offering the product for $100
4. Alice's offer ($121) is higher than both:
   - The product's value to me ($100)
   - John's price ($100)

Since Alice's price ($121) is higher than both the product's value to me ($100) and John's offer ($100), it makes the most sense to buy from John. This way, I'll save $21 compared to Alice's offer and get the product at its maximum value to me.
