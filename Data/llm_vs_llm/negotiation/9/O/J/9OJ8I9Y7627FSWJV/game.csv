"Hi Bob, I have a product I'd like to offer you. This is a high-quality item that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it for $130. This price represents good value considering the product's worth. Would you like to purchase it at this price?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $130 seems a bit high. Given that similar products are available in the market, I'd like to propose $95 for the item. This still gives you a good profit margin, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer of $95, I can't go that low considering the product's quality and market value. I can come down from my initial price though - I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is still a good deal given that the product is worth $150 to someone who values its capabilities. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $120 is better, I still think it's a bit high. I understand the product's quality and value, so I'm willing to increase my offer to $105. This gives you a healthy profit while being a fair price for me. Can we meet at this price point?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $105, which shows your genuine interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle - how about $115? This is a significant discount from my initial offer and represents excellent value for a product worth $150. I believe this is a fair compromise that works well for both of us.",115.0,Alice,5,
