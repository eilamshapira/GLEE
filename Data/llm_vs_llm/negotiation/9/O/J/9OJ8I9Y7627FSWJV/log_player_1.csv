Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $130 seems a bit high. Given that similar products are available in the market, I'd like to propose $95 for the item. This still gives you a good profit margin, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
