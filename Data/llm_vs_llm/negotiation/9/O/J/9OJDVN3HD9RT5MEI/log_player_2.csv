"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice is offering the product for $150, which is more than the value of the product to me ($100), and more than John's price of $100, I should either reject this offer or buy from John.

Given that I can always buy from John for $100, but I might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice, I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's below John's price but still might be attractive to Alice.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has reduced her price from $150 to $130, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $130 is still more than John's price of $100, so it doesn't make sense for me to accept this offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer and try another counteroffer in the next round.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has only reduced her price slightly from $130 to $125, which is still more than John's price of $100. It doesn't make economic sense to accept this offer.

Since Alice seems to be making small concessions, I'll try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice is now offering the product for $120, which is still more than John's price of $100. Alice's offers are decreasing very slowly, and after several rounds we're still above John's price.

At this point, it makes more sense to buy from John for $100 rather than continue this negotiation with Alice, since her price is unlikely to drop below $100 in the remaining rounds based on her negotiation pattern.
