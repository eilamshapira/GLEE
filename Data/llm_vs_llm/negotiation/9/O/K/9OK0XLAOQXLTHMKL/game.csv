"Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I understand that the product has exceptional value, but $17000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay a reasonable price, considering the product's worth to me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8000, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.
