Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $17,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth and I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I understand that the product has exceptional value, but $17000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay a reasonable price, considering the product's worth to me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8000, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me ($15,000) and even lower than its worth to Bob ($10,000), I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate and try to reach a better price. Selling to John for $15,000 is an option, but I want to try to get a good deal with Bob first. 

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.

I believe this price is more reasonable, and I'm open to further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down from the initial price. However, $14000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9500, which I believe is a more reasonable price considering my budget and the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $9,500 is still lower than the product's worth to me ($15,000) and even lower than its worth to Bob ($10,000) is getting closer, I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have 6 rounds left to negotiate and try to reach a better price. Selling to John for $15,000 is an option, but I want to try to get a good deal with Bob first.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come up from your initial price. I can see that we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10500, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm getting close to my budget limit, so I hope we can reach an agreement soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Since Bob's offer of $10,500 is still lower than the product's worth to me ($15,000), but it's getting very close to the product's worth to Bob ($10,000), I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. However, I need to be careful not to push Bob too far, as he mentioned he's getting close to his budget limit. I still have 4 rounds left to negotiate and try to reach a better price. Selling to John for $15,000 is an option, but I want to try to get a good deal with Bob first.

Next, I will send a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I can see that we're very close to a mutually agreeable price. Considering the product's exceptional value, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $11,500. I believe this price is more reasonable, and I'm open to further negotiations.
