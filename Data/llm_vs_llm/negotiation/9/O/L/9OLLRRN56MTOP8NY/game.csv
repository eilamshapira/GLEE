"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value and rarity of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle, but your initial offer is a bit out of my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must say that $12000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to meet my minimum requirements. I can offer you a price that's still competitive, yet closer to what I'm looking for.",22000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $22000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer, but I need to stay within a comfortable price range. I'd like to propose a price that's closer to the middle ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I can see that we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. Considering the product's value and the fact that I have another offer on the table, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I can offer you a price that's very close to what you're looking for, but still meets my minimum requirements.",15000.0,Alice,5,
