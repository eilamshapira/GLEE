Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value and rarity of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle, but your initial offer is a bit out of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is lower than what John is willing to pay ($15,000), and it's also lower than the product's value to me, I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price."

However, I must say that $12,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to meet my minimum requirements. I can offer you a price that's still competitive, yet closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 22000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $22000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer, but I need to stay within a comfortable price range. I'd like to propose a price that's closer to the middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

Since Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to what John is willing to pay ($15,000), but still lower, I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get an even better price or at least match John's offer."
