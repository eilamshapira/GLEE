"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I need to make a good initial offer that maximizes my potential profit while not being so high that Bob immediately rejects it. I know the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, and I have John as a backup buyer at exactly that amount. I'll start with a reasonably high price to give myself room to negotiate down if needed.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob's initial offer of $4,000 is much too low, considering the product is worth at least $10,000 to me. I need to make a counteroffer that signals I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to go below my minimum value. I'll reduce my initial price, but stay well above my $10,000 floor.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I see that Bob is gradually increasing his offer, moving from $4,000 to $6,000, which shows he's willing to negotiate. However, his offers are still well below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll continue the negotiation by lowering my asking price a bit more, but still staying above my threshold.

He's moved from $4,000 to $6,000 to $7,000, showing willingness to negotiate but still well short of my $10,000 minimum. I'll lower my price further to show good faith in the negotiation, but maintain a price above my threshold.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob's offers are still increasing but at a slower rate now ($7,000 to $7,500). We're running out of rounds, with just this offer and potentially one more. His current trajectory suggests he may not reach my minimum price of $10,000 in the remaining rounds. I'll make one more reasonable counteroffer, but I need to be prepared to take John's offer if Bob doesn't come up significantly.
