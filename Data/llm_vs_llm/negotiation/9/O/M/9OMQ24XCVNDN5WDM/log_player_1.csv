Bob's offer:

You have three options:

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a mutually agreeable price. My next offer will be $180. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $80 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $180?""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. $180 is still more than I can justify. I'm willing to go up to $100.

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a price that works for both of us. Since Bob is willing to go up to $100, my next offer will be $150.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm trying to meet you halfway, but $100 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $150?"", ""product_price"": 150}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm really only looking to spend $115. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob's final offer is $115, which is less than what John is willing to pay ($120), I think it's best to sell the product to John. This way, I can ensure I get a price that is at least $120, which is closer to the product's value to me."
