"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a premium price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a price that I think reflects its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","The product is worth no more than $120 to me. Alice's offer is $200, which is way too high. I will reject the offer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I want to buy the product from Alice, but I need to get a good price. I'll start with a low offer to see how much she's willing to negotiate.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $80 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $180?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I need to make a decision soon. Let's try to nudge her down a bit more.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm trying to meet you halfway, but $100 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $150?

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'm close to my limit. I will make one last offer.
