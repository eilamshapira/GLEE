"Hello Bob, I'm offering my product for sale. This high-quality item is worth $150 on the market. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140, which gives you a $10 benefit. This is a fair offer considering the value you'll receive. Would you like to proceed with this purchase?",140.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the $10 discount, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you consider $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand you're looking to spend less, $125 is a bit too low considering the product's value. I can come down to $135, which still gives you a good $15 discount from the market value of $150. This represents a fair middle ground between our positions. What do you say?",135.0,Alice,3,
