Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand you're looking to spend less, $125 is a bit too low considering the product's value. I can come down to $135, which still gives you a good $15 discount from the market value of $150. This represents a fair middle ground between our positions. What do you say?
