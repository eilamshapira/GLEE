"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $2000000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential value. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. I'm willing to lower the price, but I still believe it's worth more than your initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1800000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1400000. This is a fair price considering our previous discussions and my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
