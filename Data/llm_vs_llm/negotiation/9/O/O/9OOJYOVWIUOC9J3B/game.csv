"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be a great addition to your collection. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm pricing it at $12000. I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 given my budget and the market value.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and my initial price, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $11000, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going at this point.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $11000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $8500 to meet you in the middle.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $8500. I'm willing to make another compromise and lower my price to $10500. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
