"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Given Bob's counteroffer of $6,000, I have to make a decision. Since the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, and I can sell it to John for $8,000, I have to consider what's best.

Here's my analysis:

*   **Accept Bob's offer ($6,000):** This is a loss.
*   **Sell to John ($8,000):** This is the break-even point.
*   **Reject and counteroffer:** There's potential to get a higher price from Bob, but also the risk of him walking away.

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","This is a tough decision. Let's analyze:

*   **Accept Bob's offer ($7,000):** This is a loss, but less of a loss than previous offers.
*   **Sell to John ($8,000):** This is a guaranteed $8,000.
*   **Reject and counteroffer:** We're getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but risk losing the deal altogether.

I've tried to get a higher price and Bob is still low. I'm going to minimize my risk and take the deal that guarantees my minimum value.
