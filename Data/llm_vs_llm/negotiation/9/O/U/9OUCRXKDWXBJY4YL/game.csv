"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're offering, I must inform you that your asking price of $2000000 exceeds my budget. I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a more competitive price. My counteroffer is $1300000. This gives you a chance to make the sale while allowing me to stay within my budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, the product's value to me is significant. I'm willing to lower my price to $1800000 to meet you halfway. Let me know if this revised offer works for you.",,Alice,2,RejectOffer
