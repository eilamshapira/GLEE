Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're offering, I must inform you that your asking price of $2000000 exceeds my budget. I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $1500000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a more competitive price. My counteroffer is $1300000. This gives you a chance to make the sale while allowing me to stay within my budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
