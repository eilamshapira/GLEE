"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $2000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. Since John is offering the same product for $1,500,000, which is exactly my maximum budget, I should reject Alice's offer. I could make a counteroffer, but there's no guarantee Alice would accept a price that works for me.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're offering, I must inform you that your asking price of $2,000,000 exceeds my budget. I have another seller, John, who is offering the same product for $1,500,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a more competitive price. My counteroffer is $1,300,000. This gives you a chance to make the sale while allowing me to stay within my budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, the product's value to me is significant. I'm willing to lower my price to $1800000 to meet you halfway. Let me know if this revised offer works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice's revised offer of $1,800,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000, and it's also higher than John's offer of $1,500,000. While I could make another counteroffer, at this point it makes more financial sense to go with John's guaranteed offer.
