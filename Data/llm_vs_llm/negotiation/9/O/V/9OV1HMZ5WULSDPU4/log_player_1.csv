Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my desired price and is higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($80), but still lower than what I initially offered ($100), I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price.

My decision is to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. However, the format requires me to respond with one of the given options, and since making a counteroffer isn't explicitly listed as an option but is implied as part of the negotiation process, I will choose the option that allows for further negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob offered $90, and I initially asked for $100, I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my initial price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob has come back with the same offer of $90 after my counteroffer of $95. Since his offer is still below my initial asking price but significantly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($80), and considering that further negotiation may not yield a substantially better offer, I'll consider accepting his offer this time.

Accepting $90 is better than selling to John for $80, and it seems that Bob is not willing to go higher than $90.
