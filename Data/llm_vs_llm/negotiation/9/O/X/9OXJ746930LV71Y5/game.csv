"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $350. It's a fantastic item and I think you'll really find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",350.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $350 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal if we can meet at this point.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate you being upfront. $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down. How about $300?",300.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $300. I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit short of that price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $140. I think this is a reasonable price, and I'm willing to make a deal if we can meet at this point.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! $140 is still lower than I'd like. I'm going to meet you in the middle a bit more aggressively this time. How about $250?",250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down further. $250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering we're getting closer, I'd like to make another counteroffer of $145. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to finalize the deal if we can meet at this point.",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Alright Bob, let's try this. $220, and that's the lowest I can realistically go. It's a great product and I think you'll be very happy with it.",220.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your honesty about $220 being the lowest you can go. However, I've been considering other options and I still think we can meet at a lower price point. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $148. If we can't meet at this price, I may need to explore other options.",148.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Okay Bob, this is my absolute final offer. $200. Take it or leave it. I believe it's a fair price, and if you don't agree, I'll have to move on.",200.0,Alice,9,
