"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $900000 is significantly below the product's true value. Given that this product would provide substantial value to your business, I'm willing to adjust my initial price to $1150000. This represents a considerable reduction from my first offer while still reflecting the product's genuine worth.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
"Alice, thank you for your revised offer. While I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, I still believe there's room for further compromise given current market conditions. I propose we settle at $1000000 for the product. I look forward to your response.",1000000.0,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your consideration and the dialogue we've had so far. After reflecting on your position and the available alternatives, I'm prepared to adjust my offer slightly. My next and final counteroffer is $1050000. I believe this amount fairly represents the value of the product while also aligning with the broader market context. I look forward to your response.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
