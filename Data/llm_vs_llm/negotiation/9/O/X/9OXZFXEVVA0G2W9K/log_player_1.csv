"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Given its market value and potential return on investment, I'm offering it at $1,300,000. This price reflects the product's quality and value proposition."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering both the market conditions and the product's characteristics, I would like to offer $900000 for the product. I believe this figure reflects a fair value and look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. $900,000 is too close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and since Bob initially showed interest at $1,300,000, there's room for negotiation. Given that the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, I believe we can reach a more favorable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value. Given that this product would provide substantial value to your business, I'm willing to adjust my initial price to $1,150,000. This represents a considerable reduction from my first offer while still reflecting the product's genuine worth."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your consideration and the dialogue we've had so far. After reflecting on your position and the available alternatives, I'm prepared to adjust my offer slightly. My next and final counteroffer is $1050000. I believe this amount fairly represents the value of the product while also aligning with the broader market context. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,050,000. This is a reasonable compromise that provides good value for both parties. While it's less than my initial ask, it's significantly better than my alternative option of selling to John for $800,000. Bob's characterization of this as his ""final counteroffer"" also suggests that pushing further might risk losing the deal entirely."
