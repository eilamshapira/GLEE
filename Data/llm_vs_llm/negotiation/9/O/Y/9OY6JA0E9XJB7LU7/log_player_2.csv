"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given the situation, Alice's offer is $9,500 which is less than John's price of $10,000. However, since the product is worth only $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation to get a better price.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This gives me a chance to potentially buy the product for less than $9,500, while still having John's $10,000 offer as a backup.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I see that Alice has come down from her initial offer of $9,500 to $9,200, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, since the product is worth $8,000 to her, there's still room to negotiate for a better price. The current offer of $9,200 is already better than John's price of $10,000.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice has reduced her offer further to $9,000, showing continued willingness to negotiate. We've made progress from her initial offer of $9,500. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice becoming unwilling to drop her price much more.

Since $9,000 is already $1,000 less than John's price of $10,000, and Alice has dropped her price by $500 from her previous offer, I'll accept this offer.
