"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Okay, here's my opening offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you the opportunity to acquire this unique product. Considering its exceptional qualities and rarity, I'm willing to offer it to you for a price of $1,500,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However,  $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm currently comfortable with. Given the potential for negotiation, I'd like to propose a starting price of $1200000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Okay, I need to decide whether to accept Bob's $1,200,000 offer, counter, or sell to John.

Since my minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000, and Bob's offer is above that, I will reject the offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, let's try this:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, I believe the product's value is closer to $1,400,000. I'm confident in its potential and believe this price reflects its true worth. How about we meet at $1,400,000?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1400000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1300000. This would be a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Okay, here's the situation: Bob's now offering $1,300,000.  My options are to accept, counter, or sell to John for $1,000,000.

Since $1,300,000 is still significantly more than my minimum, I'll reject and counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright, let's see if we can get closer to a deal:
