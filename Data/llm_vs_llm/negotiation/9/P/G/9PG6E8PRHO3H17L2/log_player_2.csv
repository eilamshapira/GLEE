You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","The product is worth $150 to me. Alice is offering it for $150. I could buy it from John for $150 as well. There's no advantage to rejecting and trying to negotiate further in this situation.
