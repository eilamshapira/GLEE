"Alice, your product looks promising, but $1800000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1300000. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in this product.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, I must inform you that I have another buyer willing to pay $1500000 for the product. However, I value the potential of doing business with you. I can offer you the product for $1600000, which is still a competitive price considering its market value.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but $1600000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000, which is closer to my budget and still a good price for the product. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
