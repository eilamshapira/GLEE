"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's features and potential."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product looks promising, but $1800000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1300000. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I can get from John ($1,500,000). I'll try one more time to negotiate with Bob for a better price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, I must inform you that I have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. However, I value the potential of doing business with you. I can offer you the product for $1,600,000, which is still a competitive price considering its market value."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but $1600000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000, which is closer to my budget and still a good price for the product. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $1,500,000. While Bob has shown willingness to negotiate and has increased his offer, it's still $100,000 below what John is willing to pay. Given that the product is worth $1,500,000 to me and John is offering exactly that amount, it makes the most financial sense to sell to John rather than continue negotiations with Bob, who may not be able to match or exceed John's offer."
