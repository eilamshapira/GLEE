"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations if you have a different valuation in mind. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $12,000, which is $4,000 more than my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $8,000, which matches my maximum value
4. While I could try negotiating with Alice, her initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum value ($4,000 difference)
5. Even if Alice is willing to negotiate, starting from $12,000 would likely require multiple rounds to reach anywhere near $8,000, if at all possible

Given that:
- Alice's initial offer is far above my maximum value
- I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at my maximum acceptable price
- The time and effort of negotiation might not result in a better deal than John's offer

The most rational decision is to buy from John.
