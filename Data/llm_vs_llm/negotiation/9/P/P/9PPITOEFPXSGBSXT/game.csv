"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $300 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $80 for the product. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $300 is a bit much. However, $80 is far too low, as the product is worth at least $100 to me. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $220.",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $220 is still out of my budget. Considering your minimum value of $100, how about we settle at $90? This is a fair compromise given my constraints.",90.0,Bob,4,
