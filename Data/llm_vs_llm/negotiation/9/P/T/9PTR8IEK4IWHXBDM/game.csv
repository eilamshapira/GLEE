"Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm pricing it at $2000000. This is a competitive price for this particular item, and I believe it represents a good investment opportunity for you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, the price you're asking is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $600000 for the product, considering my financial constraints and market comparisons. Let me know if this works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $600000 is significantly below its value. My minimum acceptable price is $1500000, as I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay this amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $1800000, which I believe is still a fair price given the product's quality and market value.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1800000 is still out of my budget. Given the market and my financial situation, I can increase my offer to $700000. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
