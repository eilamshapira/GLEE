# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a valuable product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm pricing it at $2000000. This is a competitive price for this particular item, and I believe it represents a good investment opportunity for you.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, the price you're asking is beyond my budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $600000 is significantly below its value. My minimum acceptable price is $1500000, as I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay this amount. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $1800000, which I believe is still a fair price given the product's quality and market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still out of my budget.
