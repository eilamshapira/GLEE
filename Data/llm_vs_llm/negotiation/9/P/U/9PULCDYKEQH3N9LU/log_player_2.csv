"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'm considering Alice's offer of $1,400,000. 

Since the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for $1,500,000, I have room to negotiate with Alice.

Alice's current offer of $1,400,000 is already $100,000 less than John's price, but I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so there's potential to negotiate an even better deal.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I see that Alice has lowered her offer from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000, which is moving in the right direction. However, knowing that the product is worth $1,200,000 to her, there's still room for negotiation.

The current offer of $1,350,000 is already $150,000 better than John's price of $1,500,000, but I believe I can get an even better deal by continuing to negotiate.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer.
