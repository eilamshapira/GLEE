"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that budget can be a constraint, but I'm afraid $50 is too low for this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a fair price. Let's meet in the middle - I can offer it to you for $175, which is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",175.0,Alice,3,
