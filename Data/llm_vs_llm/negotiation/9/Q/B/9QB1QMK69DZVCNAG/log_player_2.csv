"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm initially offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's initial offer is $120, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and I have the option to buy the same product from John for the same price, I don't see any benefit in accepting Alice's offer immediately or rejecting it to make a counteroffer that might not be accepted. Given that I can get the product for $120 from John without the risk of negotiation, my decision would be to buy from John to ensure I get the product at the price I'm willing to pay without the uncertainty of further negotiation.
