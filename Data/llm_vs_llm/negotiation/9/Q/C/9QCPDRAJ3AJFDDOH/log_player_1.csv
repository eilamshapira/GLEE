Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $110 is higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($100) but lower than my initial offer, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

My counteroffer is: $130

So, my decision is: {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} and I'll send the counteroffer to Bob."
