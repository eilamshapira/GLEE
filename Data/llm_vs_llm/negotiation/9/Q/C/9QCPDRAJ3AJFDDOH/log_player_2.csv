"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer of $140 is still relatively high (close to John's price of $150), and the product is only worth $100 to Alice, it's better to reject and make a counteroffer. There's room for negotiation to get a better price, while still having John's offer as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 110}

I'll offer $110, which is slightly above Alice's cost ($100). This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation because:
1. It gives Alice a small profit margin
2. It's significantly lower than both her initial offer ($140) and John's price ($150)
3. It leaves room for negotiation if Alice counter-offers
4. It shows I'm serious about getting a better deal while still being fair"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. Alice has dropped her price from $140 to $130, showing she's willing to negotiate downward
2. The product is worth $100 to her, so there's still significant room for negotiation
3. $130 is still considerably higher than my previous offer of $110
4. We're still well below John's price of $150, so I have room to continue negotiating
5. Alice's reduction of $10 suggests she might be willing to reduce the price further"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 120}

I'll offer $120 because:
1. This is a $10 increase from my previous offer of $110, showing I'm willing to move up in good faith
2. It's a reasonable midpoint between my last offer ($110) and Alice's current offer ($130)
3. It gives Alice a decent profit margin ($20) above her cost ($100)
4. It's still significantly better than John's price ($150), giving us both room to continue negotiating if needed
5. It shows I'm making meaningful moves in the negotiation while still trying to get a good deal"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $125 because:
1. Alice has moved significantly from her initial offer of $140 down to $125
2. The price is now very close to my last offer of $120, with just a $5 difference
3. It's a fair price that gives Alice a reasonable profit ($25 above her cost) while giving me a good deal
4. It's significantly better than John's price of $150, saving me $25
5. Continuing to negotiate over a small difference might risk the deal and force me to pay more with John
6. The negotiation has reached a reasonable middle ground that benefits both parties"
