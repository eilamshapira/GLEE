Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a price of $170. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($120). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This first offer will help me understand how interested Bob is and what his perception of the product's value might be. If he accepts immediately, great! If he rejects or tries to negotiate, I can adjust accordingly.
* **Backup Plan (John):** I'm not overly aggressive with the initial price because I have John as a reliable backup buyer. This reduces the pressure to make a deal with Bob at any cost."
