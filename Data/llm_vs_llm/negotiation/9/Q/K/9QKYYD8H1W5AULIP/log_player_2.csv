"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a price of $170. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

The rational choice is to buy from John for $150 because:
1. The product is worth no more than $150 to me
2. Alice's offer of $170 is above my maximum value
3. John's guaranteed price of $150 matches my maximum value
4. Buying from John saves me $20 compared to Alice's offer"
