,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Let me know if we can work something out!",60.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. However, $60 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $130. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $125? This is a fair price and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $125 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, so how about $70? I think this is a reasonable price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",70.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $70 is still below my minimum price. I can go down to $122, which is very close to my bottom line. Let me know if this works for you.",122.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. How about $121? This is the lowest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me. Let me know if this is something you can agree to.",121.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $121 is still quite far from what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and your new price. How about $95? This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I hope it's something you can consider.",95.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. However, $95 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to lower my price to $120, which is my absolute bottom line. Let me know if this works for you.",120.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've gone as low as I can go. My final offer is $120. This is the best price I can offer, and it's a fair deal considering the value of the product. Let me know if you can accept this offer.",120.0,Alice,7,
