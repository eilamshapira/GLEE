Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth at least $80 to me (my reservation price)
2. If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $80 from John
3. Bob's value for the product is unknown
4. I should price above $80 to maximize my profit
5. If I price too high, Bob might reject
6. A reasonable markup would be around 50% above my minimum

Based on this reasoning, I'll offer the product at $120, which:
- Gives me a good profit if accepted
- Isn't so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected
- Still guarantees me $80 if rejected
