"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this exclusive product. Considering its exceptional nature, I'm offering it to you for $2500000. This is a fantastic opportunity, and I believe you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me. Alice is offering it for $2,500,000. If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy it from John for $1,000,000. Since $1,000,000 is less than $2,500,000, I should reject Alice's offer and buy from John.
