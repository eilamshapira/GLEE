"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on the market value and the product's features, I'm offering it for $18500. This is a premium product that provides excellent value for its price. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?",18500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18500 is well above my budget. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $8000 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but I'm afraid $8000 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value and I need to ensure I receive a fair price. I could come down to $16000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This product has features and quality that justify this price point. Would you be able to meet me at this price?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16000, but that's still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $12000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of your product while remaining within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,4,
