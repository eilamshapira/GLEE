Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Based on the market value and the product's features, I'm offering it for $18,500.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but I'm afraid $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value and I need to ensure I receive a fair price. I could come down to $16,000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This product has features and quality that justify this price point. Would you be able to meet me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16000, but that's still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $12000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of your product while remaining within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
