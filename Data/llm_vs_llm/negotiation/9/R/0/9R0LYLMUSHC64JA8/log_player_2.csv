Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I understand budget constraints, but I'm afraid $8000 is below my minimum acceptable price. The product has significant value and I need to ensure I receive a fair price. I could come down to $16000, which represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This product has features and quality that justify this price point. Would you be able to meet me at this price?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
