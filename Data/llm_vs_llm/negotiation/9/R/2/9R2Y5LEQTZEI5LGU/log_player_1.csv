Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's condition and potential return on investment. I look forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is below what I can accept. This product has significant value, and I already have another buyer willing to pay $800,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can lower my price to $1,050,000, which I believe is fair considering the quality and potential ROI of this product. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Considering you mentioned another buyer is willing to pay $800000, I'd like to meet you in the middle between my previous offer and that price. I'm willing to offer $700000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.
