Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but $600000 is below what I can accept. This product has significant value, and I already have another buyer willing to pay $800000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can lower my price to $1050000, which I believe is fair considering the quality and potential ROI of this product. How does that sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Considering you mentioned another buyer is willing to pay $800,000, I'd like to meet you in the middle between my previous offer and that price. I'm willing to offer $700,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
