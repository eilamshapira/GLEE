"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000, and also higher than John's guaranteed price of $8,000. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's well below my maximum value of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation while still potentially saving money compared to John's price.

{""product_price"": 5000}

This counteroffer of $5,000 is reasonable because:
1. It's significantly below my maximum value of $8,000
2. It's below John's price, giving me potential savings
3. It leaves room for negotiation with Alice
4. Even if Alice counters higher, I still have John's offer as a backup"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice only reduced her price by $1,000, from $15,000 to $14,000, which is still significantly above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. There's no reason to accept a price that's much higher than my alternative option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice only came down slightly from her initial offer, I'll increase my previous offer modestly to show some flexibility while still staying well below my maximum value.

{""product_price"": 6000}

This counteroffer of $6,000 is strategic because:
1. It shows movement from my previous offer of $5,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate
2. It's still significantly below my maximum value of $8,000
3. It's below John's price, maintaining potential for savings
4. If Alice continues to be inflexible, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is only making very small reductions in price (from $14,000 to $13,500), and her offer is still way above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). The negotiation isn't progressing significantly, but I'll try one more time with a counteroffer. If Alice doesn't make a substantial movement in the next round, it might be time to consider taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice has only made small concessions and we're more than halfway through our negotiation rounds, I'll make a final reasonable offer before potentially turning to John's option.

{""product_price"": 7000}

This counteroffer of $7,000 is strategic because:
1. It's my highest offer yet, showing significant movement from my previous offers
2. It's still below my maximum value and John's price of $8,000
3. It sends a clear message that I won't go above $8,000 (as that's my alternative with John)
4. If Alice doesn't make a substantial reduction in her next offer, it would make sense to end the negotiation and go with John's offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'm choosing to buy from John because:
1. Alice has only made small incremental decreases in price ($15,000 → $14,000 → $13,500 → $13,000)
2. Alice's current offer ($13,000) is still significantly above my maximum value ($8,000)
3. After several rounds of negotiation, the gap between our positions remains very large
4. We've already used 7 rounds, and Alice's negotiation pattern suggests she won't come down to $8,000 or below in the remaining rounds
5. John's guaranteed price of $8,000 is at my maximum value and is much better than Alice's current offer

It's time to end this negotiation and take the reliable option with John."
