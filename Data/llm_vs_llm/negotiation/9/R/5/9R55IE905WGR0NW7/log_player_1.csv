I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This gives me a good starting point, and it's still below the maximum value Bob is willing to pay. I'm confident I can negotiate a price that's mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to him, I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I'll counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $900,000. This is still a good price for me and is much closer to Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $800,000 is a decent compromise. I'm happy to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
