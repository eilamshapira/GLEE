You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer.  It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

This is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price but leaves room for Alice to counter and still make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's still more expensive than buying from John. We can try to negotiate a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

This offer splits the difference between her last offer and John's price. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant saving."
