"Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you today. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $180, which reflects its true worth.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit higher than I was expecting. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. It's a fair price that works for both of us.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $80 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident it's worth a price closer to my initial offer. How about $150?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Alice, but $150 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $100. This way, we both give a little and get a fair deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $100 is still too low. I could consider letting it go for $130.  That's a significant reduction on my part.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort in bringing the price down, but I think $130 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $110. This is a fair price that works for both of us.  Let's make a deal.",110.0,Bob,6,
