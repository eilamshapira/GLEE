"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you today. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $180, which reflects its true worth.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit higher than I was expecting. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. It's a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}

(Starting low to see how much I can save. Let's see what Alice says.)"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $80 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident it's worth a price closer to my initial offer. How about $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I understand where you're coming from, Alice, but $150 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $100. This way, we both give a little and get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 100}

(Increasing my offer but still trying to get a good bargain. Let's see what Alice says.)"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $100 is still too low. I could consider letting it go for $130.  That's a significant reduction on my part. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort in bringing the price down, but I think $130 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $110. This is a fair price that works for both of us.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 110}

(I think $110 is a reasonable price.  I get a good deal, and Alice still makes a profit. Let's see if Alice accepts it.)"
