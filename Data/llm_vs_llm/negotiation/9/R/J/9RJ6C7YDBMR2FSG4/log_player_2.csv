"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an exclusive product that I believe has significant value. I'm initially offering it for $2000000. This is a unique opportunity, so please let me know if youâ€™d like to proceed with this offer or if you have another proposal in mind. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the offered price of $2,000,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,000,000, and I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and consider other options.
