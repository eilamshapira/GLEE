"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your budget constraint. Unfortunately, I can't go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $110? This way, we both make a compromise.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the compromise, Alice. I appreciate it, but $110 is still a bit high for me. Could you go down to $107? It's closer to your original counter and still within my budget.",107.0,Bob,4,
