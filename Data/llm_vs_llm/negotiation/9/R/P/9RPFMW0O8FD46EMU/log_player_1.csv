Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my pricing strategy. Since the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed buyer at exactly that price, I need to set a price for Bob that balances the chance of acceptance with maximizing my profit.

Given that I don't know Bob's valuation, I'll set a price that's significantly higher than my $8,000 floor, but not so high that it would immediately cause Bob to reject it. I want to capture more value if Bob values the product highly.
