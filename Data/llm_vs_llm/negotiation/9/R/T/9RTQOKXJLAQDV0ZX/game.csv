"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you at a competitive price. I've taken into consideration its worth to you and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree that this product has value, but I think $14000 is a bit high. Would you be willing to come down to $11000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $11000. I understand that you think $14000 is a bit high, but I still believe the product has great value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'd like to propose a price of $13500. This is a compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $13500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12250?",12250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your willingness to meet in the middle at $12250. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I was thinking more along the lines of meeting in the middle between my previous offer of $13500 and your offer of $11000. That would put us at around $12750. I'm willing to sell the product to you for this price, which I believe is a fair compromise for both of us.",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand where you're coming from, but I'm afraid $12750 is still a bit too high for my budget. To be completely honest, I have a firm limit at $12000.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to close the deal today.",12000.0,Bob,6,
