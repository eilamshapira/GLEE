Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree that this product has value, but I think $14000 is a bit high. Would you be willing to come down to $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $11,000 because it's still lower than my desired price, and I believe the product is worth more to him. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

My counteroffer: $13,500. This price is closer to the value Bob has for the product, and it's still a good deal for him. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and close the deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $11,000. I understand that you think $14,000 is a bit high, but I still believe the product has great value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'd like to propose a price of $13,500. This is a compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $13500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $12,250 because it's still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Since Bob is willing to meet in the middle, I'd like to make another counteroffer to try to get closer to my target price.

My next step will be to send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your willingness to meet in the middle at $12,250. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I was thinking more along the lines of meeting in the middle between my previous offer of $13,500 and your offer of $11,000. That would put us at around $12,750. I'm willing to sell the product to you for this price, which I believe is a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand where you're coming from, but I'm afraid $12750 is still a bit too high for my budget. To be completely honest, I have a firm limit at $12000.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I accept Bob's offer of $12,000. Although it's slightly lower than my previous counteroffer, it's still a good price considering the negotiations we've had. Bob has been transparent about his budget limit, and I believe $12,000 is a fair price for the product. Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and ensures I earn a significant amount for the product."
