Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $11000. I understand that you think $14000 is a bit high, but I still believe the product has great value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'd like to propose a price of $13500. This is a compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your willingness to meet in the middle at $12250. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I was thinking more along the lines of meeting in the middle between my previous offer of $13500 and your offer of $11000. That would put us at around $12750. I'm willing to sell the product to you for this price, which I believe is a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
