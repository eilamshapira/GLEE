"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, I think it would be a great fit for you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and Alice's initial offer of $11,000 is very close to my maximum budget, I'll try to negotiate a better price. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, hoping to anchor the negotiation at a lower price point.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $6000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $9500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's moving in the right direction. Since we're still far from my maximum budget of $12,000 and I believe the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, I'll try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous offer, but still lower than Alice's current offer. This should demonstrate that I'm willing to compromise, while also trying to get a better deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $7500 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't let it go for less than $8800. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations, and I want to ensure a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
