"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to consider Alice's offer carefully. She's asking for $175, which is significantly above the maximum value of $100 that the product is worth to me. I also know I can buy the same product from John for exactly $100, which is the maximum I value it at.

There's no reason for me to accept Alice's offer of $175 when I can get the same product from John at a lower price. Even if I were to make a counteroffer to Alice, I couldn't reasonably expect her to go below $150 (the value of the product to her).

The most economical decision is to buy from John.
