"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's clear that $200 is far above both my maximum value ($80) and John's alternative price ($80). There's no reason to accept this offer, and it makes more sense to make a counteroffer rather than immediately going to John, as we might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 50}

I'll start with a lower offer of $50. This gives room for negotiation while still being a reasonable price. If Alice doesn't accept, we can gradually work towards a middle ground, while always having John's $80 offer as a backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$150 is still well above both my maximum value ($80) and John's alternative price ($80). While Alice has reduced her price from $200 to $150, showing some willingness to negotiate, this price is still too high. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, as there's still potential to negotiate a better price than John's $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 65}

I'll increase my offer to $65. This is a significant increase from my previous offer of $50, showing I'm willing to negotiate in good faith. It's still below John's price of $80, giving me room to potentially save money, while also hopefully showing Alice that I'm serious about making a deal. If Alice doesn't accept, I still have the option to either continue negotiating or go with John's offer."
