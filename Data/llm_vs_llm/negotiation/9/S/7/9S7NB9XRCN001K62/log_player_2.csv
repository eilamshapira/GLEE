"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our product, which is valued at a premium due to its exceptional quality and features. I believe you'll appreciate the value it brings and I'm offering it to you for $1800000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject this offer because:
1. The offered price ($1,800,000) is well above my maximum value ($800,000)
2. The price is even higher than Alice's own valuation ($1,500,000)
3. John's offer ($800,000) is much better and matches my maximum value
4. However, I'll make a counteroffer first to see if we can negotiate a better deal with Alice before going to John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,800,000 is significantly above market value for this product. Given current market conditions and comparable products, I can offer $700,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's features and market positioning."", ""product_price"": 700000}

This counteroffer is strategic because:
1. It's below my maximum value ($800,000)
2. It leaves room for negotiation if Alice counters
3. It's significantly lower than her valuation ($1,500,000), but not insultingly low
4. If Alice rejects, I still have John's offer ($800,000) as a backup
5. I've provided a reasonable justification for the lower price by referencing market conditions"
