"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, make a counteroffer, or buy from John instead.

Alice is offering the product for $20,000, which is double the $10,000 maximum value it has to me. It's also double John's price of $10,000.

Given that I can purchase the product from John for $10,000, and the product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, Alice's offer of $20,000 is clearly not attractive. There's no reason to accept an offer that would cause me to lose money.

I should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice that's significantly lower than her initial price but still provides some room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": $7,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $18,000 is still well above both the maximum value of $10,000 to me and John's price of $10,000. This offer still doesn't make financial sense for me.

Alice has reduced her price by only $2,000 from her initial offer, suggesting she might be willing to negotiate further, but we're still far from a reasonable price.

Given that I can purchase the product from John for $10,000 at any time, and Alice's offer is still $8,000 higher than that, I should reject this offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": $8,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $17,500 is still $7,500 above John's price of $10,000, and it's still above the maximum value of $10,000 that the product is worth to me.

While Alice continues to lower her price, she's only reduced it by $500 from her previous offer, which suggests she might be expecting to negotiate for a long time with small decrements. We've already gone through several rounds, and we're still far from reaching a price that would be better than John's offer.

Since John's offer of $10,000 is already at my maximum valuation of the product, and Alice's price is still substantially higher, it makes more sense to purchase from John rather than continue this negotiation which isn't progressing quickly enough.
