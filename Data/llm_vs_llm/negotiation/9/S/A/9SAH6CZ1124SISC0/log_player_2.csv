"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an exclusive product that I'm offering you. I believe it would be a great fit for you! I'm willing to sell it for $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
2. Alice is asking for $18,000, which is above my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $15,000

I should reject Alice's offer of $18,000 since it's above both my maximum value and John's price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better deal from Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's below John's price of $15,000, starting with a relatively low price to leave room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18,000 is significantly above my budget. Based on my market research and the product's value, I can offer $12,000. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but unfortunately, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell the product for $16500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's new offer of $16,500 is:
1. Still above my maximum value of $15,000
2. Higher than John's price of $15,000
3. Not a good deal for me

I'll reject this offer. There's no reason to accept a price that's higher than my alternative option with John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice came down from $18,000 to $16,500, showing some flexibility, I'll increase my previous offer but still stay below John's price to maintain room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $16,500 is still above my budget. I can increase my offer to $13,500. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair value for the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your increased offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't accept $13500. How about $15500? I believe it's a fair price for such a valuable product. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's offer of $15,500 is still:
1. Above my maximum value of $15,000
2. Higher than John's price of $15,000

At this point, since Alice is still offering a price higher than John's alternative, and we've gone through several rounds of negotiation without reaching a price below $15,000, it makes more sense to take John's offer rather than continue negotiating.
