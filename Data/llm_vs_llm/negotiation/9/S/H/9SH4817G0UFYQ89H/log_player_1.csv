Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 25000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Considering my options, I must choose between $8,000, a potential counteroffer, or selling to John for $10,000. I need at least $10,000 for the product.

Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a crucial moment. Bob's offer is now exactly what John is offering. I could try to get more from Bob, but there's also a risk of him rejecting my offer and me ending up with nothing if I can't reach an agreement. Since I already have a guaranteed $10,000 with John, and I'm uncertain of getting more from Bob, I will choose the safer option.
