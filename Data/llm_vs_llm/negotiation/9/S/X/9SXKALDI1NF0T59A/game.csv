"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're working within a budget, but $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down from my initial price, so let's meet in the middle at $13500? This way, we both make a compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13500 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $12500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
