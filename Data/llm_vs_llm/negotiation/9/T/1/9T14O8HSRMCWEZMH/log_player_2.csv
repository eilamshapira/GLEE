"Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $80
2. The product is worth $80 to me (maximum I'm willing to pay)
3. John's price is also $80
4. My goal is to save money

Since all prices are equal ($80), and I need the product, I can accept any offer. There's no financial advantage in choosing one over the other. In this case, I might as well accept Alice's offer since she made the effort to make the offer first.
