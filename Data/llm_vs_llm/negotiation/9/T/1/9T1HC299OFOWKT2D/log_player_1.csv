Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to make an offer that Bob might accept, but I also want to maximize my profit. If the offer is rejected, I'm guaranteed $12,000 from John.

I should price above my minimum ($12,000), but not so high that Bob will certainly reject it. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'll set a reasonable markup that gives me a good profit while still having a chance of being accepted.
