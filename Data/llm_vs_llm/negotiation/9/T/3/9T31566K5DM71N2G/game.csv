,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $8000 is significantly below the product's value. To move this forward, I can offer it for $16000. This is a more reasonable compromise, reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. $16000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $12000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
