"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth every penny. I'm offering it to you for $12000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'll analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer is $12,000
2. The product is worth $10,000 to me
3. John is willing to sell it for $10,000
4. Alice's initial offer is higher than both my maximum value and John's price

Since Alice's offer ($12,000) is higher than John's price ($10,000) and higher than my maximum value ($10,000), it wouldn't make sense to accept it. I could try negotiating with Alice, but since John's price is already at my maximum value, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower than $10,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives room for negotiation but also reflects my value assessment:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12,000 is quite a bit higher than what I was looking to spend. Based on my market research and budget, I would be willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price that would work well for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your response! While I understand your budget, I am willing to lower my price. How about I offer the product for $10500? I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let's analyze the situation:

1. Alice's new offer is $10,500
2. The product is worth $10,000 to me
3. John is offering it for $10,000
4. Alice's offer is still above both my maximum value and John's price

Since Alice's offer ($10,500) is still higher than both John's price ($10,000) and my maximum value ($10,000), it's not in my best interest to accept it. While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing the price significantly, there's no reason to pay more than what John is offering.
