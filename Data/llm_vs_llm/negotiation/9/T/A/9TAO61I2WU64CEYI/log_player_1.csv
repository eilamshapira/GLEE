"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is below my minimum threshold of $10,000 and I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, I will not accept Bob's offer. However, I still want to try to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

My counteroffer is: $11,000

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $7,000 is still below my desired price, but it's getting closer. Since I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, I won't accept Bob's offer. However, I want to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a better price.

My decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer. I'll try to meet Bob halfway between my previous offer and his current offer.

My counteroffer will be slightly lower than my previous one, to show that I'm willing to negotiate. 

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $7,500 is still below my desired price, but it's getting closer. Since I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, I won't accept Bob's offer. However, I want to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a better price.

At this point, I'm willing to consider a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above $8,000, since that's the value he initially had in mind for the product, according to the problem statement, but I also know that I have a better option.

My decision is to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer, but I will make a small concession.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly the value he has for the product, but it's still below my desired price. Since I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, which is a better deal for me, I don't see any reason to accept Bob's offer.

At this point, I think it's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer significantly, and I have a better option available. Therefore, I will stop negotiating with Bob and sell the product to John for $10,000.

So, my decision is: 
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
