"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I think that's a fair compromise.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's meet in the middle.",95.0,Bob,4,
