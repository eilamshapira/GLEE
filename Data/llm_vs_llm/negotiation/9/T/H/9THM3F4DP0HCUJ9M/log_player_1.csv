Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. I'm offering it at $17,500. This is a fair price considering the quality and value of the product."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $17500 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs and budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Reasoning: Bob's offer of $8,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Given that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $15,000, and Bob's initial counteroffer is so low, it's unlikely that we'll reach a mutually beneficial agreement through further negotiation. Bob's maximum valuation is only $10,000, so he won't be able to match John's offer. The most rational decision is to sell to John immediately and secure the $15,000."
