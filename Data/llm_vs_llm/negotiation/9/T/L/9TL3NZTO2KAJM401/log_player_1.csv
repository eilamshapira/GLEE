Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think strategically about this offer. 

Since the product is worth $10,000 to me and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $10,000, I can be relatively aggressive in my pricing to Bob. There's no downside risk for me.

Bob might value the product significantly higher than $10,000, so I should aim for a higher price to maximize my potential profit, while understanding that if Bob rejects, I'm still secure with John's offer.

I'll set a price significantly above my minimum value, but not so high that it would immediately appear unreasonable.
