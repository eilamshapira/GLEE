Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. This price allows for a fair profit margin for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality and value of your product. However, to make this deal more feasible for me, I would like to propose a price of $1050000. I believe this is a fair compromise and hope we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer. While $1,050,000 is above my minimum threshold, there's still room for negotiation since I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. I'll try to find a middle ground between our positions.
