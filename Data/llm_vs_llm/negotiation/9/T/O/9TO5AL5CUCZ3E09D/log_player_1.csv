I reject Bob's offer because it's below the minimum value I have for the product, and I believe I can get a better deal.

I reject Bob's offer of $1,450,000. Although it's getting closer to a price that I might consider, it's still below the threshold of $1,500,000, which I can get from John. Since I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 and Bob's offer, although increasing, is still not meeting this minimum, I'll make another counteroffer to see if Bob is willing to meet or exceed the $1,500,000 mark."
