Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

```json
{""product_price"": 3000000}
```

My reasoning is as follows:

*   **High Initial Anchor:** I want to set a high anchor point in the negotiation. $3,000,000 is a substantial amount, which signals the perceived value of the product is very high.

*   **Potential for Discovery:** I need to gauge Bob's willingness to pay. Starting high allows me to assess his reaction and potentially learn more about how much he values the product. If he immediately rejects it with a low counteroffer, it gives me information to work with.

*   **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing that I can always get $1,000,000 from John gives me the confidence to start with a higher price. I'm not desperate to sell.

I'm ready to see Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
