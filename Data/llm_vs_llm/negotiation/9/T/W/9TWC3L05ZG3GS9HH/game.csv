"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the quality, $180 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to offer $50.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm afraid $50 is too low for me to accept. However, I'm willing to lower my price to $160. This is a great value for the product you're getting.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price.  I can go up to $60, but that's really my limit.",60.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. However, $60 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $110. This way, we both give up some of our initial goals and reach an agreement.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still quite a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  My absolute maximum is $70. If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with another option.",70.0,Bob,6,
