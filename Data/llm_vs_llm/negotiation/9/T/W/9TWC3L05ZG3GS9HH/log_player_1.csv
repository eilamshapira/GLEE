Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the quality, $180 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to offer $50. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price.  I can go up to $60, but that's really my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. However, $60 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $110. This way, we both give up some of our initial goals and reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $110 is still quite a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  My absolute maximum is $70. If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with another option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I don't see a viable negotiation with Bob reaching a satisfactory outcome for me. It would be better for me to accept the guaranteed $120 from Jhon."
