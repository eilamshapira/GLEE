Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to be careful with my offer to Bob. The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I know I can always sell it to John for that amount. However, Bob values it at only $1,200,000, which means he wouldn't rationally pay more than that.

Given this situation, I could try to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible from Bob, since anything above that would likely be rejected. But I should be prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't offer enough.

I'll start with an offer that's high but possibly within range for negotiation:

{""product_price"": 1,190,000}"
