"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,190,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,190,000 is less than my maximum budget of $1,200,000, and it's also close to my target, I'll consider accepting it to save time and effort. However, I also have the option to try and negotiate further to see if I can get an even better deal.

Given that Alice's initial offer is already quite low, it suggests she might be willing to negotiate further. But, considering the offer is only $10,000 below my maximum budget, and negotiating further might not yield significant savings, I might as well accept the current offer to ensure I get the product without risking Alice pulling out of the negotiation or John changing his price.

Therefore, my decision is: {""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
