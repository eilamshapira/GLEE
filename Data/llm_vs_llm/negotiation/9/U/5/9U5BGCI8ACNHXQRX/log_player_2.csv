{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:** We need to show willingness to move towards a middle ground, so we're increasing our offer more significantly this time. However, we're still leaving room for negotiation before reaching John's price. Time is becoming a factor."
