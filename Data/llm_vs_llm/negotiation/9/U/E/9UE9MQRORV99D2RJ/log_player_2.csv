"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product. While I've received an offer from another buyer for $12000, I wanted to give you the opportunity to purchase it first. However, since I cannot go below $12000 based on my current alternative, I'm offering it to you at this price. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice is not budging from her $12,000 price, which is above your maximum budget. You can get the product for a better price from John."
