"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I believe $20000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $12000. I think this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $17000. Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price to $17000. However, I still think it's a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle between my previous offer and your current offer. I'll make a counteroffer of $14500. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $14500 is closer to what I have in mind, I can't accept that price.  How about we settle at $16000? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,5,
