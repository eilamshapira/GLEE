"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and sets the stage for a potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than my initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to get a better price by counteroffering in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from my initial offer, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm also not willing to accept a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is a slight improvement, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm going to try one more time to get closer to my desired price. I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly, but it's still at my minimum acceptable price. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not going to settle for less than what I think the product is worth."
