"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll reject Alice's offer since her price is the same as John's, and we have room to negotiate for a better deal. Given that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, there's potential to reach a lower price that benefits both parties.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start with a relatively low offer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low that it would be considered unreasonable given Alice's known cost of $1,000,000.

{""product_price"": 1050000}

This offer gives Alice a $50,000 profit while still saving me a significant amount compared to John's price. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice has reduced her price by $50,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, there's still room for a better deal since her cost is $1,000,000. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer but still aim for a price that gives me significant savings compared to John's price while offering Alice a reasonable profit.

{""product_price"": 1100000}

This offer gives Alice a $100,000 profit while saving me $100,000 compared to John's price. It's a fair middle ground between our last positions."
