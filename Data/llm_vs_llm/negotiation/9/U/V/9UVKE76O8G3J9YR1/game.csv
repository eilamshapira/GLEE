"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $150 is at the very top of my budget. I can find the same product from John for $150 as well. Could you do $120 for it? That would help me out and I'd be happy to buy from you rather than John.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  That's still a good price for me, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",130.0,Alice,3,
