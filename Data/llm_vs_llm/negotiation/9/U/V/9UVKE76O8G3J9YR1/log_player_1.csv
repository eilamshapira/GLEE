"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $150 is at the very top of my budget. I can find the same product from John for $150 as well. Could you do $120 for it? That would help me out and I'd be happy to buy from you rather than John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
