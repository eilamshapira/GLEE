"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice is asking for $1,450,000, which is not too far from John's price of $1,500,000. However, it's worth trying to negotiate a better deal with Alice since I have room to make a counteroffer. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, so there's significant room for negotiation between her cost and my maximum price of $1,500,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still provides her with a reasonable profit above her $1,000,000 cost.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice has reduced her price from $1,450,000 to $1,300,000, which is a significant improvement. This is now $200,000 less than John's price of $1,500,000. While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has already shown flexibility by reducing her price by $150,000. The current offer of $1,300,000 gives Alice a $300,000 profit while saving me $200,000 compared to buying from John.
