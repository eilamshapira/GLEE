"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","$100 is a good offer - it's well above my minimum acceptable price of $80 and represents a reasonable compromise from my initial offer. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price, and I risk Bob walking away or reducing his offer.
