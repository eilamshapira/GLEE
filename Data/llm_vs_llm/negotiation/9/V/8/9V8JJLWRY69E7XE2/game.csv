"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $9000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10250? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value of this product. ",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about we settle at $9500? That's a significant jump from my initial offer and shows I'm serious about purchasing.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, $9500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10000. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal happen.  Let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Alice,5,
