"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product, knowing its immense value to you. Given its worth of $1500000 to you, I'm initially offering it at a price of $1475000. I believe this price reflects the significant benefit you'll receive.",1475000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1350000, considering I have another option available to me at $1500000. I believe this price is more reasonable and would be willing to make a deal at this amount.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're considering other options. However, given the unique benefits this product offers you, and the significant value you'll derive, I believe $1450000 is a fair price. It's a slight reduction from my initial offer, reflecting my willingness to negotiate and secure this deal with you.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the slight reduction in your offer. However, I still believe there's room for further negotiation. Given the product's value to you is likely lower than $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'd like to propose a price of $1400000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to finalize the deal at this amount.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
