Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1350000, considering I have another option available to me at $1500000. I believe this price is more reasonable and would be willing to make a deal at this amount.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the slight reduction in your offer. However, I still believe there's room for further negotiation. Given the product's value to you is likely lower than $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'd like to propose a price of $1400000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to finalize the deal at this amount.
