"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'd like to offer you my product for $12000. It's a high-quality item that I believe will be valuable to you. However, I should mention that I have another interested buyer, John, who is willing to pay $10000 for it. I'd prefer to sell it to you if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $8,000 to me (my maximum value)
2. Alice is offering it for $12,000
3. John is willing to sell it for $8,000
4. Alice's product costs more than both:
   - My maximum value ($8,000)
   - John's alternative price ($8,000)

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly above my maximum value, and I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $8,000. Even if I try to negotiate with Alice, since the product is worth $10,000 to her, it's unlikely she'll go below that price.

Therefore, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
