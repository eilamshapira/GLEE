"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $250 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $150 and also higher than John's price. It would be better to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal from Alice, knowing I always have the option to buy from John at $150 if negotiations don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since the product is worth $150 to me and that's also John's price, I'll start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 100}

This offer is reasonable because:
1. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $250, showing room for negotiation
2. It's below my maximum value of $150
3. If Alice rejects this, we can still negotiate towards a middle ground
4. I maintain the option to go to John at $150 if negotiations don't progress favorably"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $220. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $220
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $220 is still well above both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150). While she has moved down from her initial $250 offer, it's still not a good deal for me. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, as there's still room for negotiation. If we can't reach a price below $150, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 120}

I'll increase my offer slightly from my previous $100 to show willingness to negotiate, but still stay well below my maximum value. This counteroffer of $120:
1. Shows movement from my previous offer, demonstrating good faith negotiation
2. Remains comfortably below my maximum value of $150
3. Leaves room for further negotiation
4. Maintains a good bargaining position since I can still go to John at $150
5. Signals to Alice that her price needs to come down significantly to make a deal"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $190. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $190
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $190 is still above both my maximum value ($150) and John's price ($150). While she continues to lower her price, it's still not competitive with John's offer. I'll reject and make another counteroffer. If Alice won't go below $150, I'll ultimately go with John's offer, but it's worth trying one more time to negotiate with Alice for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 135}

I'll increase my offer to $135 because:
1. It shows significant movement from my previous offer of $120, demonstrating serious negotiation
2. It's still below my maximum value of $150 and John's price
3. It's a substantial increase from my previous offers, showing I'm willing to be reasonable
4. It signals to Alice that while I'm willing to pay more, I won't go above $150 (since I have John's option)
5. If Alice doesn't accept a price near this range, it would make more sense to go with John's offer"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John because:
1. Alice's latest offer ($170) is still well above John's price ($150)
2. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Alice's offers remain above my maximum value
3. The gap between Alice's offers and my maximum value ($150) isn't closing quickly enough
4. John's price ($150) matches my maximum value, making it a fair deal
5. There's no indication that Alice will drop her price below $150

It's time to end the negotiation and take the guaranteed option with John rather than continue negotiating without clear progress toward a better deal."
