"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for sale. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. Would you be willing to pay $160 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $160 seems a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

I'm starting with a low counter-offer to gauge Alice's reaction and get a sense of how flexible she might be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob. However, $80 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Alice is coming down, but she's still above my ideal price and John's offer. I'll try to negotiate a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between her last offer and my previous one. It keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price significantly below John's offer."
