Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $100 to Bob
2. It's worth $80 to me (my minimum)
3. If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for $80
4. There's room for negotiation between $80 and $100

I should price it high enough to make a good profit, but not so high that Bob will definitely reject it. Since Bob knows the product is worth $100 to him, offering slightly below that would give him some incentive to accept.

{""product_price"": 95}

This price gives Bob a $5 benefit while maximizing my profit. If he rejects, I still have John's $80 offer as a backup."
