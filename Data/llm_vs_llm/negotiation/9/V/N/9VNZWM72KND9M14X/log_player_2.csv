"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is close to my maximum budget of $1,000,000, but I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, I'll choose to reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. This gives me a chance to potentially negotiate a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","To start the negotiation, I'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable, considering the product's value to Alice is $800,000. My goal is to save as much money as possible while still being realistic about the negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $900,000 is still somewhat high, considering the product's value to her is $800,000. Since I have 8 rounds left to negotiate and my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer again and make another counteroffer. This approach allows me to continue negotiating towards a potentially better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Given that Alice rejected my previous offer of $750,000 and then lowered her price to $900,000, it indicates she's willing to negotiate but hasn't met me halfway yet. To continue the negotiation, I'll increase my offer slightly, aiming to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me while still being attractive to Alice.
