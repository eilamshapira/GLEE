Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its worth to me."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I believe a fair price for the product would be $1000000. I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the minimum amount I'm willing to accept, and selling to John would yield the same result, I'll consider the benefits of continuing negotiations versus closing the deal immediately.

Given that I have 9 more rounds to negotiate and Bob has already shown willingness to pay $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to see if I can get a better price.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a price that's closer to its true value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for it. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I would like to propose a price of $1050000 for the product. I hope we can find a middle ground.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with, but I still believe the product is worth more. Since I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, I'll choose to reject Bob's offer again and try to get a better price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress. However, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I would like to propose a price of $1050000 for the product, as it better fits my budget. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","It seems like Bob has gone back to his previous offer of $1,050,000. At this point, I've rejected several offers and counteroffers, and we're halfway through the negotiation process. While $1,050,000 is still not my ideal price, it's getting closer to a reasonable compromise.

Considering I have 4 more rounds to negotiate, but also taking into account that Bob might not be willing to budge much further, I'll choose to accept his offer of $1,050,000. This way, I can ensure a sale and avoid the risk of not reaching a better agreement in the remaining rounds.
