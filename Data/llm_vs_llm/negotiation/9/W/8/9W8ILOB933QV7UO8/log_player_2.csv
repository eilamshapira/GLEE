"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than my maximum budget of $1,200,000, and it's also more than what the product is worth to Alice ($800,000), I can try to negotiate or reject the offer to see if I can get a better deal. However, buying from John for $1,200,000 is my upper limit, and Alice's offer is already below that. 

Given the options and considering I want to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer might prompt her to lower the price, since she wants to sell the product and it's worth $800,000 to her. There's a potential for a better deal if I reject the current offer.
