"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $150. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","**{ ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**

Let's see if Alice is willing to sell it at a lower price. There's no harm in trying to negotiate since I have the option to buy from John at $150 anytime. I'll start by offering $100 and see how Alice responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","**{ ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit high. How about I offer $100 instead?"",
