"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start with a relatively high offer to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","I'll reject Bob's offer since it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 (and even below John's guaranteed offer).

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a new counteroffer at $900,000, showing some flexibility from my initial offer while maintaining a strong negotiating position.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer of $750,000 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $800,000. Since we're already in round 4 and Bob's increments are small ($50,000 increase from his last offer), it would be safer to sell to John rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might not reach $800,000.
