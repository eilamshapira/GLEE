"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to decide carefully here. Alice is offering the product for $950,000, which is $150,000 more than my maximum valuation of $800,000. It's also $150,000 more than John's price of $800,000.

Since Alice's initial offer exceeds my maximum valuation, and I have the option to buy from John at exactly my maximum valuation, I'll reject Alice's offer to see if I can negotiate a better price than John's.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that gives us room to negotiate while being fair to both sides.

{""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has lowered her price from $950,000 to $900,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still $100,000 more than John's price of $800,000, and $100,000 more than my maximum valuation.

Since Alice's offer still exceeds both my maximum valuation and John's price, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my previous offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price better than John's alternative.
