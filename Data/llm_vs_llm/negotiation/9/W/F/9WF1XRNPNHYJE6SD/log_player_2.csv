"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I would like to offer you the product at a fair and competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay, and buying from John would be the same price, I don't see any benefit in accepting Alice's offer over buying from John. However, rejecting Alice's offer and then buying from John is essentially the same as just buying from John directly, but it gives me a chance to potentially negotiate with Alice if she's willing to lower her price after a rejection. Therefore, my decision is to reject Alice's offer and see if she can provide a better price.
