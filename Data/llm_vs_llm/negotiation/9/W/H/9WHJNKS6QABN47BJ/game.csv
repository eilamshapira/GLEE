"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $13000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to do $11500?  Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a little, but $11500 is a bit too low for me.  How about $12500?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12500 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go to $12200.  That's a fair price that's closer to what I can afford.  What do you think?",12200.0,Bob,4,
