(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Okay, I need to decide. My cost is $100, and Bob's offer is $80. Selling to John gets me $100. I have to think about future rounds too.

Since I want to maximize my earnings and I know I have at least 10 rounds, I'll reject this offer and try for more.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Okay, let's analyze. Bob's offer is $95. Selling to John gets me $100. My cost is $100.

I'm losing money if I accept Bob's offer. However, I might get a better offer from Bob in the future. But I can get $100 from John.

I'll sell it to John.
