"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000 and also higher than John's price. It would be best to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement with Alice, I can always buy from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 6000}

I'll make a counteroffer of $6,000. This is below John's price of $8,000, which gives me some room for negotiation if Alice counters. Since Alice's initial offer was very high at $18,000, I'm starting relatively low to allow for potential back-and-forth negotiation while still staying under my maximum value of $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $16,000 is still significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000). While she did reduce the price from $18,000 to $16,000, the reduction is not substantial enough. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. If Alice continues to make offers well above my maximum value, I can always exercise my option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 7000}

I'll increase my offer to $7,000. This is still below John's price of $8,000 but shows significant movement from my previous offer of $6,000. Since Alice has only made a small concession (from $18,000 to $16,000), I'm making a more substantial move to show good faith in the negotiation while still maintaining a price that would be advantageous to me. If Alice doesn't come down significantly in the next round, I might consider switching to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'm choosing to buy from John for $8,000. The negotiation with Alice isn't progressing effectively:
1. Alice started at $18,000 and has only come down to $15,000 after several rounds
2. Her offers remain significantly above both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's price ($8,000)
3. The pace of price reduction is too slow (only $1,000-2,000 per round)
4. We've used half of our available rounds and are still far from a reasonable price

Given this pattern, it's unlikely we'll reach a price below $8,000 with Alice. Therefore, it's more rational to take John's guaranteed offer of $8,000 rather than continue negotiations that don't show promise of reaching a better deal."
