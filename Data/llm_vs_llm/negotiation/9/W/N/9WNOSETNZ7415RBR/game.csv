"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the perceived value, $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer a much lower price. Would you consider $5000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $20000 may be out of your budget, but $5000 is significantly lower than the value I have in mind for this product. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to counteroffer at $15000, which is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $15000 is still too high for me.  I can go up to $7500.  This is a significant increase from my initial offer, reflecting my genuine interest in the product. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer to $7500. I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to get a price that better reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. I'd like to counteroffer at $12000.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for continuing to negotiate. I'm getting closer to my maximum budget. I can offer $9000.  This is a substantial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.  If this doesn't work, I'll likely have to explore other options.",9000.0,Bob,6,
