"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Given the information:
- The product is worth no more than $120 to me
- Alice's offer is $180
- John is willing to sell the product for $120

Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than both the maximum value of the product to me ($120) and John's guaranteed price ($120). There's no reason for me to accept Alice's offer.

Since John is offering the product at exactly my maximum valuation, and this is guaranteed, I should buy from John rather than entering a negotiation with Alice where I might not get a better deal.
