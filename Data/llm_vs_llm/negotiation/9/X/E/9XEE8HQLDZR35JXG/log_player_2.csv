"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an exclusive offer just for you. I’m offering this unique product for $1500000. If this price works for you, let me know—otherwise, I’ll be selling it to another buyer for $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, and Alice's offer is $1,500,000, which is higher than my maximum budget, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,200,000.
