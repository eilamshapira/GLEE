"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a wonderful product that I believe would be perfect for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $10,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $10000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $6000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $6,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. Let me make a counteroffer.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $6,000 is too low for this product. I can reduce my initial price to $9,000. This is a more competitive offer considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $6,000 is too low for this product. I can reduce my initial price to $9,000. This is a more competitive offer considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down to $9000, Alice. However, it's still a bit out of my budget. I can go up to $6500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $8,000. Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and there's no indication that he'll reach this price point. It's more profitable to take John's guaranteed offer of $8,000 rather than continue negotiations that might not lead to a better outcome."
