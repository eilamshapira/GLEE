Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider what price to offer Bob. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, which is the maximum he would rationally pay. Since I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, I don't want to go below that price.

Since Bob and I both value the product at $1,200,000, I'll offer it to him at exactly that price. There's no reason for me to offer a discount when I have a guaranteed alternative buyer at the same price.
