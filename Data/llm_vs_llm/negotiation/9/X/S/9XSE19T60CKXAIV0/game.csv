"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $8000 is the maximum I could pay, and at that price I could also purchase from another seller. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6500. This would give me some savings while still providing you with a good sale. What do you think?",6500.0,Bob,2,
