Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. Iâ€™m offering the product to you for $8,000. Please let me know if you'd like to proceed."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $8000 is the maximum I could pay, and at that price I could also purchase from another seller. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6500. This would give me some savings while still providing you with a good sale. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
