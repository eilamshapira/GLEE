"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. Iâ€™m offering the product to you for $8000. Please let me know if you'd like to proceed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I notice that Alice is offering the product for $8,000, which is exactly the same price that John is offering, and also the maximum amount this product is worth to me. Since Alice's offer doesn't provide any savings compared to John's price, I should try to negotiate for a better deal.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $8,000 is the maximum I could pay, and at that price I could also purchase from another seller. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6,500. This would give me some savings while still providing you with a good sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 6500}"
