"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $180. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While the product looks great, $180 is a bit over my budget. I'd be willing to buy it for $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll continue negotiating as $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round that's more reasonable but still profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too low for this product's value. I understand you have budget constraints, but I can't go below $165. This is already a significant reduction from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 165}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $165 is still too high for me.  I could go up to $95.  This is a fair price considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $150. After two rounds of negotiation, Bob's offers remain well below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and his last increase was minimal (from $80 to $95). Given that I have a guaranteed buyer at $150, and Bob seems unlikely to reach an acceptable price point, it's best to take the sure deal with John."
