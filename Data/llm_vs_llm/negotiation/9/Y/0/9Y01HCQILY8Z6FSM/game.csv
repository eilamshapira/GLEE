"Hi Bob, I have a quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it for $150. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $150 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth around $80 to me, and I can actually get it from another seller at that price. However, I'd be happy to buy from you instead if we can agree on a more reasonable price. I'm willing to offer $70 for the product. What do you think?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $70 as it's below my cost. While I understand your position, this product's quality and value justify a higher price. I can offer it to you for $125, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is quite reasonable considering the product's features and market value.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate the reduction, but $125 is still quite a bit more than what I'm comfortable paying. As I mentioned, I can purchase this same product from John for $80, which aligns with its value to me. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $80, which is the same price John is offering. This seems fair since it matches the market rate I've found elsewhere.",80.0,Bob,4,
