Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it for $150. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $150 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth around $80 to me, and I can actually get it from another seller at that price. However, I'd be happy to buy from you instead if we can agree on a more reasonable price. I'm willing to offer $70 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $70 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and even below what the product is worth to him ($80), I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer. However, I always have the option to sell to John for $120 if we can't reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $70 as it's below my cost. While I understand your position, this product's quality and value justify a higher price. I can offer it to you for $125, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is quite reasonable considering the product's features and market value."", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate the reduction, but $125 is still quite a bit more than what I'm comfortable paying. As I mentioned, I can purchase this same product from John for $80, which aligns with its value to me. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $80, which is the same price John is offering. This seems fair since it matches the market rate I've found elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Since Bob is only willing to pay $80, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I have a guaranteed offer from John for $120, it makes the most economic sense to sell to John. The negotiation with Bob is unlikely to reach a price that would be acceptable to me, as he's clearly anchored to the $80 value point."
