"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a quality product that I'd like to offer you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it for $150. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $150 for the product.

Since the product is only worth $80 to me, and John is willing to sell it to me for $80, Alice's offer of $150 is not a good deal. I should either make a counteroffer to Alice or buy from John directly.

Given that I can always buy from John at $80 as a backup option, there's no reason to accept Alice's significantly higher price of $150.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, $150 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. The product is worth around $80 to me, and I can actually get it from another seller at that price. However, I'd be happy to buy from you instead if we can agree on a more reasonable price. I'm willing to offer $70 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $70 as it's below my cost. While I understand your position, this product's quality and value justify a higher price. I can offer it to you for $125, which is already a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is quite reasonable considering the product's features and market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to evaluate Alice's new offer of $125 for the product.

Alice has reduced her initial price from $150 to $125, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still significantly higher than the $80 the product is worth to me, and I can buy it from John for $80.

Since I can get the exact same product from John for $80, there's no reason to pay Alice $125. I should either continue negotiating with Alice or simply buy from John.

Given that I have a guaranteed option to buy at $80 from John, and Alice's current offer is still $45 more than that, the economically rational choice is:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate the reduction, but $125 is still quite a bit more than what I'm comfortable paying. As I mentioned, I can purchase this same product from John for $80, which aligns with its value to me. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. I can offer $80, which is the same price John is offering. This seems fair since it matches the market rate I've found elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 80}"
