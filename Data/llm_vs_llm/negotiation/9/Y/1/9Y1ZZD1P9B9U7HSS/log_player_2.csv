"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to consider the options carefully here:

Option 1: Accept Alice's offer at $140
Option 2: Reject and make a counteroffer
Option 3: Buy from John at $150

Since Alice's product is worth no more than $150 to me, and John is selling it for exactly $150, Alice's offer of $140 is $10 less than my maximum price and John's price. However, I might be able to negotiate an even better price by making a counteroffer.

Given that the product costs Alice $100, there's room for negotiation between $100 and $150. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I see that Alice has come down from $140 to $130, which shows she's willing to negotiate. She rejected my initial counteroffer of $110, but she's moving in my direction.

The current offer of $130 is already $20 less than John's fixed price of $150, which is good. However, since Alice's cost is $100, there might still be room to negotiate a better price.

I'll reject this offer and try another counteroffer, aiming for a middle ground that might be acceptable to both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice has now come down to $125, which is $25 less than John's price of $150. I started at $110, moved to $120, and Alice has now met me in the middle at $125.

This is a reasonable compromise:
- The product costs Alice $100
- I'm paying $125, giving Alice a $25 profit
- I'm saving $25 compared to buying from John at $150
- We're close to the middle point between her cost ($100) and my maximum value ($150)

Further negotiation might risk Alice becoming frustrated, and we've already reached a fair price point. This is a good deal for both of us.
