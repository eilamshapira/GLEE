(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","That's quite a low offer, Bob. The product is worth significantly more than that. I'm going to reject it and try a different approach.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Alright Bob, let's try to find some common ground. I understand $25,000 might be a bit high to start. How about we meet in the middle-ish?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
