"Hello Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1200000 is beyond my budget for this product. My maximum valuation is considerably lower. I'm willing to offer $600000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, I'm afraid $600000 is significantly below the product's actual value. I have another buyer willing to pay $800000, which represents my absolute minimum. However, given your interest, I can offer it to you at $950000, which is still considerably below my initial offer and represents exceptional value given the product's quality and potential.",950000.0,Alice,3,
