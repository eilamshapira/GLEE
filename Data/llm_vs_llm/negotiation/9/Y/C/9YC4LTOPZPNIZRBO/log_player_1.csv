Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1200000 is beyond my budget for this product. My maximum valuation is considerably lower. I'm willing to offer $600000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, I'm afraid $600,000 is significantly below the product's actual value. I have another buyer willing to pay $800,000, which represents my absolute minimum. However, given your interest, I can offer it to you at $950,000, which is still considerably below my initial offer and represents exceptional value given the product's quality and potential."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
