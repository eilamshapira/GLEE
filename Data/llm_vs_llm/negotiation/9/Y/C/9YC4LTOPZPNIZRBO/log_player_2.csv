Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, I'm afraid $600000 is significantly below the product's actual value. I have another buyer willing to pay $800000, which represents my absolute minimum. However, given your interest, I can offer it to you at $950000, which is still considerably below my initial offer and represents exceptional value given the product's quality and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
