Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the product's premium quality, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the market conditions. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer, I can't accept $1,000,000 as that's actually below my minimum acceptable price.

I can reduce my asking price to $1,350,000, which is still a fair price given the product's quality and value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your improved offer. Unfortunately, $1,100,000 is still below what I can accept for this product. As I mentioned, I have John who is ready to pay $1,200,000. Since I'd prefer to do business with you, I'm willing to match John's offer to you - $1,200,000. This is the absolute minimum I can accept, as it represents the product's actual market value. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. I hope we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
