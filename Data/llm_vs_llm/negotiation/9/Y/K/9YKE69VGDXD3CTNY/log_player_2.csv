Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. While I appreciate your offer, I can't accept $1000000 as that's actually below my minimum acceptable price. I have another buyer (John) who is ready to pay $1200000, which represents the true market value of this product. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can reduce my asking price to $1350000, which is still a fair price given the product's quality and value. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your improved offer. Unfortunately, $1100000 is still below what I can accept for this product. As I mentioned, I have John who is ready to pay $1200000. Since I'd prefer to do business with you, I'm willing to match John's offer to you - $1200000. This is the absolute minimum I can accept, as it represents the product's actual market value. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. I hope we can close the deal at this price.
