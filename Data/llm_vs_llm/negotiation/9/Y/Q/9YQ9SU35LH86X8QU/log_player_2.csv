"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given the information, I need to make a decision that maximizes my value.

The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me.
Alice is offering to sell it for $1,200,000.
John is willing to sell it for $1,000,000.

Since Alice's offer ($1,200,000) exceeds both:
- The value of the product to me ($1,000,000)
- John's price ($1,000,000)

The rational choice is to buy from John.
