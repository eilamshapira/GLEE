"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a valuable item, and I believe this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Based on the information provided, I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, reject it, or buy from John.

Alice is offering the product for $120, which is $40 more than what the product is worth to me ($80). 

Since John is willing to sell the exact same product for $80, which matches exactly the maximum value I'm willing to pay, buying from John would be the most economical choice.
