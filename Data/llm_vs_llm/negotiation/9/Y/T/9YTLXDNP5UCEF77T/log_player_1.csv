Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is below my minimum acceptable price and I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, which is higher than Bob's offer and matches my minimum acceptable value, I will choose to sell to John to ensure I get at least the value I consider the product to be worth.
