Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price. The product is worth at least $12,000 to me, and Bob's offer of $6,000 is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're interested in the product, but I'm afraid $6,000 is too low for me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I need you to meet me closer to my target price. I'd like to offer $7000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. While $7,000 is closer to my target price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to see more movement from Bob. I'll try to find a compromise that works for both of us. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, slightly lowering my previous price to show that I'm willing to negotiate."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I'm surprised you increased the price instead of decreasing it. I'm still interested in the product, but I need a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your new offer. I'd like to offer $7500 for the product, and I hope this time we can reach an agreement.

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. While $7,500 is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and I believe I can get a better deal. I'll try to find a compromise that works for both of us, but I won't go below a certain threshold. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, slightly lowering my previous price again to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but also making it clear that I have a better alternative.
