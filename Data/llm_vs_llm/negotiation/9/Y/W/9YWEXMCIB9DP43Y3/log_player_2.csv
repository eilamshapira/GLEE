"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Since Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($8,000) and John's offering price ($8,000), it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. The best decision would be to buy from John, as this ensures I get the product at my maximum acceptable price.
