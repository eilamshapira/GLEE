Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, that's a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob. Since he's interested in the product and his initial offer is $100, I'll try to meet him halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer.

My counteroffer is $120."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me with a counteroffer. I understand that $140 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth more than $100. How about we meet in the middle? I'd be willing to sell it to you for $120. Let me know if that works for you!"", ""product_price"": 120}"
