"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'd like to start with an offer of $140. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I should reject Alice's offer. I value the product at $150, and Alice is offering it for $140. I should try to negotiate a lower price.

My answer is:
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, I'll make a counteroffer. I want to try and get the price as low as possible, but still be reasonable. I'll offer $100.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, that's a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you consider $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me with a counteroffer. I understand that $140 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth more than $100. How about we meet in the middle? I'd be willing to sell it to you for $120. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I should accept Alice's offer. $120 is less than the $150 I'd pay John, and it's less than my maximum willingness to pay of $150. It's also likely a fair price, as I would be saving $30.

My answer is:
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
