Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob.

Bob values the product at $1,200,000, while my minimum acceptable price is $800,000 (which I can get by selling to John). The ideal strategy is to set a price that Bob will accept while maximizing my profit.

I want to leave Bob with enough ""savings"" compared to his valuation that he'll accept the deal, but not so much that I'm leaving too much money on the table. A reasonable approach is to offer the product at a price that splits some of the surplus value between us, but leaning toward my advantage.
