"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I'd like to offer you. I believe you'll find it valuable and beneficial. I'm willing to sell it to you for a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's initial offer is $120, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and I also have the option to buy the product from John for the same price, I don't see any benefit in accepting Alice's offer without trying to negotiate a better price. However, given that the price Alice is offering is already at my maximum budget and I can get the same product from John for the same price, there's no real incentive for me to negotiate further if I'm not willing to go over budget. 

But, considering the negotiation process and the potential for Alice to lower her price, it might be beneficial to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to sell the product for less than $120. If Alice is not willing to budge, I can always buy from John.

Therefore, my decision is to reject Alice's offer and proceed with a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement below $120.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable considering I'm willing to pay up to $120.

Let's start with a counteroffer of $90. This gives Alice room to negotiate and potentially meet me in the middle, while also giving me a chance to save some money.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. Given the quality and demand for this product, I can offer it to you for $110. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Alice has rejected my initial counteroffer and come back with a new offer of $110, which is $10 lower than her original price. This indicates that she is willing to negotiate, but still wants to get a relatively high price for the product.

Considering my budget of $120, accepting Alice's new offer of $110 would save me $10 compared to buying from John. However, I'm still aiming to save as much money as possible.

Given that Alice has already dropped her price from $120 to $110, it's possible she might be willing to go a bit lower. I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get an even better deal.

My next counteroffer will be $100. This is a bit lower than Alice's current offer, but still within a reasonable range considering the product's original price and my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll send a counteroffer of $100 to Alice."
