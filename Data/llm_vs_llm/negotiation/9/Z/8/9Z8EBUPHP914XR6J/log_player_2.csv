"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no reason to pay more."
