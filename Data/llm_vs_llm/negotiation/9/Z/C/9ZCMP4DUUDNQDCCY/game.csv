"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but $100 is lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal. Let's try to find a middle ground.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $175 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're willing to budge a bit. I appreciate that. However, $110 is still lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I think $160 is a fair price considering the product's value.",160.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $160. I'm trying to stay within my budget. Could you go a bit lower? How about $115? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",115.0,Bob,6,
