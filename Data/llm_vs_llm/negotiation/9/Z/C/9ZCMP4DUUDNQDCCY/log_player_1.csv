I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since he's willing to increase his offer, I'll try to find a compromise. My next offer will be $160.

Since Bob's offer of $115 is still significantly lower than my desired price, and I have the option to sell the product to John for $150, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, I've decided to sell the product to John."
