"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
2. John is willing to sell the product for $100
3. Alice's offer of $250 is significantly higher than the product's value to me

Alice's offer of $250 is not reasonable - it's more than twice what the product is worth to me, and also more than John's fixed price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I need to make a reasonable counteroffer that has a chance of being accepted while still being beneficial to me. Since John is offering the product for $100 and that's the maximum value to me, I'll start with a lower offer to give room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $225. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $225
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has decreased her offer from $250 to $225, which shows some willingness to negotiate. However, this price is still well above the $100 maximum value to me, and higher than John's fixed price of $100. There's no reason for me to accept this offer when I can get the same product from John for less.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate while keeping it below John's price to maintain my advantage.

{""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice continues to reduce her price (from $250 to $225 to $200), which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, her current offer of $200 is still double what I can pay John ($100), and double the maximum value of the product to me. There's no reason to accept this offer when I have a better alternative.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I see Alice is gradually decreasing her price, but we're still far apart. I'll increase my offer more substantially to show good faith in the negotiation while still keeping well below John's price.
