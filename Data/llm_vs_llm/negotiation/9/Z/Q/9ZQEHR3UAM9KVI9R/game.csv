"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. My budget, however, is quite limited at the moment. Considering this, I'd like to offer $3000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point given my current constraints. How does that sound to you?",3000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, $3000 is significantly below the product's value. Given the quality and market conditions, I can offer it to you for $22000. This is already a reduction from my initial price, showing my willingness to negotiate. Would you consider this more reasonable price?",22000.0,Alice,3,
