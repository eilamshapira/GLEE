"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer is already at the maximum price I'm willing to pay, which is $120, and it's the same price as John's, I might as well buy it from Alice to potentially build a relationship or get better service.
