Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $12,000 to him and $8,000 to me, I'll start with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

{""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,500 is significantly better than John's $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation, I'll reject it and make a counteroffer. We're still far from the $12,000 maximum value Bob places on the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll lower my price from the initial $11,000, but still try to get a better deal than $9,500.
