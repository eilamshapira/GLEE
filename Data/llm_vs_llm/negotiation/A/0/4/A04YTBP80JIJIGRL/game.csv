"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the unique features of the product, but $20000 is way beyond my budget. Would you consider selling it for $5000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $5000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  To find a middle ground, how about we consider $14000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $6000 is still quite low for what I'm offering.  How about we meet in the middle at $11000? This feels like a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,5,
