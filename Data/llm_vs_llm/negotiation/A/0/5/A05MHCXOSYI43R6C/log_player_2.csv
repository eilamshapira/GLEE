You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Given that Alice's offer is $1,700,000, which exceeds both your maximum valuation of $1,000,000 and John's offering price of $1,000,000, the rational decision would be to buy from John.
