Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. I'm asking for $18000. Let me know what you think!,18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $18000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $6000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I appreciate your response, but $6000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about I lower my price to $16500? Let me know if that works for you!",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice, but $16500 is still too high for me. My maximum budget for this is $8000, but I'm willing to offer $7000 right now.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I appreciate your offer, but $7000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet in the middle at $12500? Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have your minimum price, but I can't go above my budget. I'm willing to offer $7500, which is as high as I can reasonably go. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I appreciate your understanding and your offer of $7500. However, I can't go that low. How about we settle at $10000? I believe thatâ€™s a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts!",10000.0,Alice,7,
