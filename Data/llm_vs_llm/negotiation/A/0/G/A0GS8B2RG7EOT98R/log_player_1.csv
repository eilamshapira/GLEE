"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what I'd accept to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  This will give me room to compromise if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $120, but I'll see if I can get closer to that price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to what I value the product at. I'm hoping Bob sees this as a fair price and will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him to come up a bit more. While I could sell to John for $120, I'm hoping to maximize my profits and see if Bob will come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I'm still not willing to go below my minimum price of $120.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and we can finally close the deal."
