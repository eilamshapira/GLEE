"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm asking $25000 for it.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, $25000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $15000 to me, which is the price another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Would you consider $12000 for the product?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $12000 is lower than what I can accept. Given your interest in the product and my willingness to negotiate, how about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $21000.",21000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for being willing to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the reduction in price, but $21000 is still significantly above what I can justify for this product. As I mentioned, I have an alternative option to purchase it for $15000, but I'd prefer to work with you. To make this deal work for both of us, I can offer $13500. This gives you a chance to make the sale today while allowing me to save a bit compared to my alternative option.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit. However, $13500 is still too low for me. Let's try to find a number that works for both of us. How about $19000? I think that's a very fair price, considering the value this product will bring you.",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price, Alice. While $19000 is moving in the right direction, it's still more than I can justify spending. I need to be transparent that I have a firm alternative at $15000, which is the maximum value this product has for me. To make it worthwhile to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I can go up to $14000, which would be my best offer. This allows you to close the sale today while giving me a small savings compared to my alternative option.",14000.0,Bob,6,
