Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, $25000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $15000 to me, which is the price another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Would you consider $12000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for being willing to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the reduction in price, but $21000 is still significantly above what I can justify for this product. As I mentioned, I have an alternative option to purchase it for $15000, but I'd prefer to work with you. To make this deal work for both of us, I can offer $13500. This gives you a chance to make the sale today while allowing me to save a bit compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price, Alice. While $19000 is moving in the right direction, it's still more than I can justify spending. I need to be transparent that I have a firm alternative at $15000, which is the maximum value this product has for me. To make it worthwhile to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I can go up to $14000, which would be my best offer. This allows you to close the sale today while giving me a small savings compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.
