"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm asking $25000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to consider whether it makes sense to accept Alice's offer of $25,000 or to negotiate for a better price. Since the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and John is willing to sell it for exactly $15,000, Alice's offer of $25,000 is clearly not a good deal for me.

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as I can always fall back on John's option if the negotiation with Alice doesn't lead to a better price than $15,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product you're selling, $25,000 is significantly above my budget. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, which is the price another seller (John) is offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Would you consider $12,000 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $12000 is lower than what I can accept. Given your interest in the product and my willingness to negotiate, how about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $21000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $21,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $21,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has reduced her offer to $21,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but this is still well above my maximum value of $15,000 and above John's price of $15,000. There's no reason for me to accept this offer when I can get the same product for $15,000 from John.

I should continue negotiating to see if Alice will come down to a price below $15,000, which would make it worthwhile to buy from her rather than John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for being willing to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the reduction in price, but $21,000 is still significantly above what I can justify for this product. As I mentioned, I have an alternative option to purchase it for $15,000, but I'd prefer to work with you. To make this deal work for both of us, I can offer $13,500. This gives you a chance to make the sale today while allowing me to save a bit compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit. However, $13500 is still too low for me. Let's try to find a number that works for both of us. How about $19000? I think that's a very fair price, considering the value this product will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has come down to $19,000, which shows she's continuing to negotiate, but this is still above my maximum value of $15,000 and above John's price of $15,000. There's no reason for me to accept a price higher than what I can get elsewhere.

Given that I can buy the product from John for $15,000, and the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, I should either continue negotiating with Alice to try to get below $15,000 or simply buy from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price, Alice. While $19,000 is moving in the right direction, it's still more than I can justify spending. I need to be transparent that I have a firm alternative at $15,000, which is the maximum value this product has for me. To make it worthwhile to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price. I can go up to $14,000, which would be my best offer. This allows you to close the sale today while giving me a small savings compared to my alternative option."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
