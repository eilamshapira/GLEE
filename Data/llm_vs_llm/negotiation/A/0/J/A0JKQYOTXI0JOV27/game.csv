"Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $5000, considering the market value and my own financial constraints.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but $5000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for reducing the price to $18000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still find it a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects a fair market value.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $6500. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I still need to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to balance it with the product's value. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offer of $18000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for further reducing the price to $15000. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I still have a budget constraint and need to be mindful of my spending. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and reflects a fair market value. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere close to this price.",7000.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $7000. I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I still need to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to balance it with the product's value. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12500, which is a significant reduction from my previous offer of $15000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the product's worth. If we can't agree on a price, I do have another buyer interested in the product, and I need to consider their offer as well. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",12500.0,Alice,7,

"Hello Alice, thank you for reducing the price to $12500. I understand that you have another buyer interested in the product, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I still need to prioritize my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects a fair market value. If we can't agree on a price, I do have the option to buy the product from another seller, John, for $8000, which is still within my budget. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere close to this price.",7500.0,Bob,8,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $7500. I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I need to be clear that I have a minimum price in mind, and I'm willing to meet you at that price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000, which is my final offer. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable selling the product for, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to consider selling the product to another buyer who has already offered me $12000. I hope we can come to an agreement, but I need to prioritize getting a fair price for the product.",12000.0,Alice,9,
