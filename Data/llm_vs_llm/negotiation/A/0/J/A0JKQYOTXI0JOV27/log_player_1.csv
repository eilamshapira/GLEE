Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $5000, considering the market value and my own financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, as $5,000 is too low for me. I'm aiming to get a better price, and I'm willing to negotiate further to achieve that. Selling to John for $12,000 is still an option, but I'd like to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob first."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for reducing the price to $18000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still find it a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects a fair market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500.

I'll make another counteroffer. While Bob's offer of $6,500 is an improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating to try to find a mutually agreeable price. Since Bob has increased his offer, I'll respond with a smaller reduction from my previous offer to see if we can meet in the middle. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer of $15,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for further reducing the price to $15000. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I still have a budget constraint and need to be mindful of my spending. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.

I'll make another counteroffer. While Bob's offer of $7,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm starting to think that Bob might not be willing to meet me at a price that I'm comfortable with, but I'll give it a few more rounds to see if we can reach an agreement. Since Bob has increased his offer again, I'll respond with a smaller reduction from my previous offer.

Next, I'll send a counteroffer of $12,500. This is a significant concession, and if Bob is not willing to meet me at or above $12,000, I may need to consider selling to John."
