"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is high-quality, the price is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,Bob's offer of $900000 is below the amount John is willing to pay. It would be wise to counteroffer with a price that is still profitable but may be more appealing to Bob.
"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand that you find the initial price a bit high. However, I believe the exceptional value of the product warrants a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and set the price at $1200000. This price takes into account your feedback and still ensures you're getting a great deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,,
