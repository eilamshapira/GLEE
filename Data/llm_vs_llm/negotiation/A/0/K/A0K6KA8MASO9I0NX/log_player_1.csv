Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate it, but I can only value this product at $80 maximum. I've actually found a similar product from another seller at $100, but I'd prefer to do business with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to sell it for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
