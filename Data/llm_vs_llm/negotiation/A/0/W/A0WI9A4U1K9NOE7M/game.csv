"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that budget can be a constraint, but I'm afraid $5000 is too low for this product. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your interest, I'm reducing my initial offer, but I still need to ensure I get a fair value for the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
