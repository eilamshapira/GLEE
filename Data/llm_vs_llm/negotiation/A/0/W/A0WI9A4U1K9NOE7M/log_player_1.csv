"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the interest and enthusiasm behind your offer. However, given my budget constraints and the pricing options available to me, I'm able to offer $5000 for the product. Please let me know if we can work with this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $5,000 because it's significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product, which is $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a more reasonable offer. I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that budget can be a constraint, but I'm afraid $5,000 is too low for this product. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your interest, I'm reducing my initial offer, but I still need to ensure I get a fair value for the product."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
