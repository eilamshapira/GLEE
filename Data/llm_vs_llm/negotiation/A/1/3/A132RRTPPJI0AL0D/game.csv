"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $150. It's a fantastic deal considering its value and quality. Let me know if you're interested!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can actually get the same product from John for $100. I'd be happy to buy from you instead if you can offer me a better deal. Would you consider selling it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your position, I can't go as low as $80 given the value of the product. How about we settle at $120? This is still a great deal for you and fair for both of us.",120.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're interested in getting a good deal. Let's meet in the middle. How about $110? It's a fair price and a great opportunity for you to get the product at a value.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. However, I still need to point out that John is selling the same product for $100. For me to choose you over John, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $90 - that way we both benefit. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,4,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go below $100 for this product. How about we settle at $105? It's very close to what you're looking for and still a good deal for you.",105.0,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal possible. Let's make it work for both of us. How about $102? It's just a bit above what John is offering, but you'll be supporting me directly.",102.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down closer to my price point, Alice. However, I still need to be practical about this. John is offering the exact same product for $100, which is already my maximum budget for this item. For me to buy from you instead, I'd need a price of $95 or less. This would give me a reason to choose you over John. Can you work with that?",95.0,Bob,6,
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I really can't go below $100 for this product. How about we meet at exactly $100? It's the same price as John's offer, but you'll be getting it from me, someone you've been negotiating with directly.",100.0,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're very close to an agreement. Let's make it simple and fair for both of us. How about we finalize the deal at $100? It matches John's offer, and you'll be supporting me directly.",100.0,Alice,7,
