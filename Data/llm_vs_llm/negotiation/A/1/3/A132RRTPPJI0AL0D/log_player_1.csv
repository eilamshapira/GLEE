# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can actually get the same product from John for $100. I'd be happy to buy from you instead if you can offer me a better deal. Would you consider selling it for $80?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal possible. Let's make it work for both of us. How about $102? It's just a bit above what John is offering, but you'll be supporting me directly."", ""product_price"": 102}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down closer to my price point, Alice. However, I still need to be practical about this. John is offering the exact same product for $100, which is already my maximum budget for this item. For me to buy from you instead, I'd need a price of $95 or less. This would give me a reason to choose you over John. Can you work with that?
