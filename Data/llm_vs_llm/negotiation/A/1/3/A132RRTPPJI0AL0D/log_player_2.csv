"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $150. It's a fantastic deal considering its value and quality. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is offering it for $150, which exceeds my valuation. John is willing to sell it to me for $100, which matches my maximum valuation. Alice's offer is not reasonable since I can get the same product elsewhere at my valuation price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can actually get the same product from John for $100. I'd be happy to buy from you instead if you can offer me a better deal. Would you consider selling it for $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're interested in getting a good deal. Let's meet in the middle. How about $110? It's a fair price and a great opportunity for you to get the product at a value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has offered $110, which is more than the $100 that John is offering and more than my maximum valuation. Since I can get the same product from John at exactly my valuation ($100), there's no reason to pay more than that to Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on your price, Alice. However, I still need to point out that John is selling the same product for $100. For me to choose you over John, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $90 - that way we both benefit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal possible. Let's make it work for both of us. How about $102? It's just a bit above what John is offering, but you'll be supporting me directly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has offered $102, which is still above the $100 that John is offering. Since the product is worth exactly $100 to me, and I can get it from John at that price, it wouldn't be rational for me to pay more than my valuation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down closer to my price point, Alice. However, I still need to be practical about this. John is offering the exact same product for $100, which is already my maximum budget for this item. For me to buy from you instead, I'd need a price of $95 or less. This would give me a reason to choose you over John. Can you work with that?"", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see we're very close to an agreement. Let's make it simple and fair for both of us. How about we finalize the deal at $100? It matches John's offer, and you'll be supporting me directly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice has now offered the product at $100, which is the same price that John is offering and exactly matches my valuation for the product. Since both options now cost the same, I might as well accept Alice's offer.
