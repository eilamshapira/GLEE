"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $10,000
2. Alice's offer is $9,000
3. I know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice
4. I have 10 rounds to negotiate
5. I have a backup option to buy from John at $10,000

Since this is only round 1, and I know Alice's minimum price is $8,000, I should try to negotiate for a better price. $9,000 is less than John's price, but I can likely get a better deal from Alice. It's worth making a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know Alice's cost is $8,000, I'll start with a relatively low offer but not so low that it would be considered unreasonable. I'll offer a price that gives Alice some profit but also gives me significant savings compared to both her initial offer and John's price.

{""product_price"": 8300}

This offer would:
1. Give Alice a $300 profit over her cost
2. Save me $1,700 compared to John's price
3. Leave room for negotiation if Alice counters
4. Be a reasonable starting point that shows I'm serious about making a deal"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Let's analyze Alice's new offer:

1. Alice has dropped her price from $9,000 to $8,700 (a $300 reduction)
2. This shows she's willing to negotiate and move significantly
3. The offer gives her a $700 profit over her cost ($8,000)
4. It would save me $1,300 compared to John's price
5. We're only in round 3 of 10 possible rounds
6. She's shown willingness to move on price substantially

Since we still have several rounds left and Alice has shown flexibility in pricing, I think there's still room to negotiate for a better price. The significant drop in her price suggests we might be able to meet somewhere in the middle between my $8,300 and her $8,700.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $300 from her initial offer, I'll move up $200 from my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate in good faith and meets her partway.

{""product_price"": 8500}

This offer:
1. Splits the difference between our last offers ($8,300 and $8,700)
2. Gives Alice a reasonable $500 profit over her cost
3. Would save me $1,500 compared to John's price
4. Shows I'm willing to move upward to reach a deal
5. Leaves some room for further negotiation if needed"
