"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1200000 is too high for me. I know that John is offering the same product for $1000000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $900000? This would save me some money while still giving you a good deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
