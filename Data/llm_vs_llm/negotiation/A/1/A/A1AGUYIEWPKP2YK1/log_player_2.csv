"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I’m offering you this product for $1200000. Let me know if you’d like to proceed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Reasoning: The current offer of $1,200,000 from Alice is above my maximum value of $1,000,000, and it's also higher than John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000. Since the product is only worth $1,000,000 to me, paying $1,200,000 would result in a loss. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate to a lower price. If Alice doesn't come down to an acceptable price, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,200,000 is too high for me. I know that John is offering the same product for $1,000,000, but I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $900,000? This would save me some money while still giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Reasoning: I'm making a strategic counteroffer below John's price of $1,000,000 for several reasons:
1. Starting with a lower offer gives room for negotiation
2. Mentioning John's competing offer of $1,000,000 establishes my BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement)
3. By offering $900,000, I'm leaving room for Alice to counter while still potentially getting a better deal than John's offer
4. The friendly tone and acknowledgment that I prefer doing business with Alice might help build rapport and encourage a favorable response"
