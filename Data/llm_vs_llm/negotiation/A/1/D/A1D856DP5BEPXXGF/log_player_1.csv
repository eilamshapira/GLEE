Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. 

I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $800,000. Since Bob doesn't know about John's offer, and given that I want to maximize my profit while still giving Bob a reasonable chance of accepting, I should set the price significantly higher than $800,000 but not so high that it would immediately be rejected.

I'll offer a price of $1,200,000, which is a 50% premium over my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room for significant profit while still potentially being within Bob's acceptable range.
