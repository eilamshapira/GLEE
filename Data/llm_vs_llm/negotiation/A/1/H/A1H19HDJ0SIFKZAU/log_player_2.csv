"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first before listing it publicly. I think it's really special and valuable. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Reason: The offer price of $200 is significantly higher than my budget of $80. I can buy the same product from John for $80, so I will reject Alice's offer and consider purchasing from John instead."
