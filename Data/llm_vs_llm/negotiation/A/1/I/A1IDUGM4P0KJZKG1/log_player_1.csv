"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for it right away. Bob's offer is too low.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still above my minimum. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
