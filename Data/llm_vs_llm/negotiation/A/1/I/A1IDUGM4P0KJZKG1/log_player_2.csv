"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Alice's offer: $1,000,000
2. My maximum value: $1,200,000
3. John's fixed price: $1,200,000
4. Rounds remaining: 9

Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is already $200,000 below my maximum value and John's price. This is a good offer, but since we are in the first round, I might be able to negotiate an even better price. Given that I have 9 more rounds and the current offer is already favorable, it's worth trying to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $1,000,000, I'll try to negotiate for a lower price. I'll start with a significantly lower counteroffer to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to appear unreasonable.

{""product_price"": 800000}

This counteroffer of $800,000 is:
1. $200,000 lower than Alice's initial offer
2. $400,000 lower than my maximum value
3. Leaves room for negotiation if Alice counters
4. Is not so low as to be considered insulting or unreasonable given the price range we're discussing"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. Original offer from Alice: $1,000,000
2. My counteroffer: $800,000
3. Alice's new offer: $900,000
4. John's fixed price: $1,200,000
5. My maximum value: $1,200,000
6. Rounds remaining: 7

Alice has reduced her price by $100,000 from her initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. The current offer of $900,000 is:
- $300,000 below my maximum value
- $300,000 below John's price
- Shows significant movement from Alice's initial position

This is a very good offer, and while we could continue negotiating, there's a risk that:
1. Alice might become frustrated and raise the price
2. We might lose the deal if we push too hard
3. We're already getting a substantial discount

Given these factors, I'll accept this offer.
