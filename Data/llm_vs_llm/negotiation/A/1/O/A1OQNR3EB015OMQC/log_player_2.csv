"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value, and I'm willing to let it go for a premium price. If you're interested, please consider my offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me
2. Alice's offer is $20,000, which is significantly higher than my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $8,000, which matches my maximum value

The logical choice would be to buy from John since:
- Alice's price ($20,000) is more than twice what I'm willing to pay
- John's price ($8,000) matches my maximum value
- There's no benefit in accepting Alice's much higher price
- There's no need to just reject Alice's offer when I have a guaranteed option with John
