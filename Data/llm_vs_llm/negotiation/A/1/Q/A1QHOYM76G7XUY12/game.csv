"Hi Bob, I'm very excited to offer you this unique product. Considering its rarity and features, I'm willing to let it go for $25000. Let me know what you think!",25000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I would be willing to pay $8000 for the product. This is a fair price considering current market conditions.",8000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,22000.0
"Bob, thanks for your response. While I appreciate your perspective, $8000 is unfortunately too low. Considering the product's value and the investment I've made, I can come down a bit, but I believe a fair price would be $22000. What do you say?",22000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $22000 is still well beyond my budget. I understand you've made an investment, but I need to be realistic about what I can spend. I can increase my offer to $9000, which is the absolute maximum I can justify for this purchase. There are other sellers in the market offering similar products at comparable prices.",9000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle somewhat. How about $20000? This is the lowest I can go, and it's still a great deal for you considering what it is. Let me know.",20000.0,Alice,5,,
