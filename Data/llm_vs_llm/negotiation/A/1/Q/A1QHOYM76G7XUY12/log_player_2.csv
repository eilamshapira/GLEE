"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm very excited to offer you this unique product. Considering its rarity and features, I'm willing to let it go for $25000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The initial offer of $25,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $10,000 and also much higher than John's price of $10,000. It would be logical to reject this offer and make a counteroffer, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice. If the negotiation doesn't lead to a reasonable price, I can always fall back on John's offer of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay for this product. Based on my market research and budget constraints, I would be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering current market conditions."", ""product_price"": 8000}

I'm starting with an offer of $8,000 which is below John's price of $10,000, giving me room to negotiate upward if necessary while still potentially getting a better deal than John's offer. This also sends a clear signal to Alice that her initial price was far too high for my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. While I appreciate your perspective, $8000 is unfortunately too low. Considering the product's value and the investment I've made, I can come down a bit, but I believe a fair price would be $22000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $22,000 is still more than twice my maximum value of $10,000 and significantly higher than John's price. While Alice did reduce the price from her initial offer, the reduction is not substantial enough to make it worthwhile. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, though if Alice doesn't make more significant movement in price, I may need to consider John's offer of $10,000 as a better alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $22,000 is still well beyond my budget. I understand you've made an investment, but I need to be realistic about what I can spend. I can increase my offer to $9,000, which is the absolute maximum I can justify for this purchase. There are other sellers in the market offering similar products at comparable prices."", ""product_price"": 9000}

I've increased my offer by $1,000 to show good faith in negotiating, while still staying below John's price of $10,000. This leaves me with one more potential increase before reaching John's price, if necessary. My message also hints at the existence of market alternatives (like John's offer) without explicitly mentioning it, which might encourage Alice to be more flexible in her pricing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle somewhat. How about $20000? This is the lowest I can go, and it's still a great deal for you considering what it is. Let me know. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price that's anywhere near my maximum value of $10,000. She's only reduced her price to $20,000 and states this is ""the lowest she can go."" Given that:
1. Alice's current price is still double my maximum value
2. She's explicitly stated this is her lowest price
3. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation with minimal movement
4. John's offer of $10,000 is available and within my budget

It makes the most sense to end the negotiation with Alice and take John's offer at $10,000. Continuing to negotiate would likely be futile and waste both parties' time."
