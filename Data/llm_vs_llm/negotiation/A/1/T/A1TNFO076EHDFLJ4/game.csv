"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $150. It's a great product and I think you'll find it very useful. Are you interested?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $150 is too high for me. I know I can get this same product from another seller for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you be willing to sell it for $60? This would save me the trouble of going elsewhere and give you a quick sale.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understood that you want a lower price. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer you the product for $120. This way, we both make a compromise, which would be beneficial for both parties.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. However, $120 is still more than I can justify spending. The product is worth no more than $80 to me, and I have a firm offer from John to sell me the same product for exactly $80. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $70. This gives you a quick sale and saves me from having to go to John.",70.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I want to close this deal as much as you do. Let's make it work for both of us. I can offer you the product for $100. This is my final offer and I think it's a fair price for the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $100 is getting closer, but I need to be honest with you - I have a firm offer from John to buy the exact same product for $80. Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, I can't justify paying more than that. I'm willing to pay you $75 to save me the hassle of going to John. This is the best I can do, considering my alternatives.",75.0,Bob,6,
