"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $150 is too high for me. I know I can get this same product from another seller for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you be willing to sell it for $60? This would save me the trouble of going elsewhere and give you a quick sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in my product, but $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to lower my price to $140. This is still a fair price considering the quality of the product. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 140}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understood that you want a lower price. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer you the product for $120. This way, we both make a compromise, which would be beneficial for both parties."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. However, $120 is still more than I can justify spending. The product is worth no more than $80 to me, and I have a firm offer from John to sell me the same product for exactly $80. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $70. This gives you a quick sale and saves me from having to go to John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $70 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $110. This is a significant reduction from my original price, and I believe it represents good value for you."",

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I want to close this deal as much as you do. Let's make it work for both of us. I can offer you the product for $100. This is my final offer and I think it's a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $100 is getting closer, but I need to be honest with you - I have a firm offer from John to buy the exact same product for $80. Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, I can't justify paying more than that. I'm willing to pay you $75 to save me the hassle of going to John. This is the best I can do, considering my alternatives. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"":""SellToJhon""}

{""message"":""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't accept $75. I have another buyer who is willing to pay me $100, so I'm going to sell the product to them. Thank you for your time and maybe we can do business again in the future.""}"
