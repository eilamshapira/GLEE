"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $150. It's a great product and I think you'll find it very useful. Are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully. She's asking for $150, but I know the product is worth no more than $80 to me. Since John is selling the same product for $80, there's no reason for me to pay more than that to Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $150 is too high for me. I know I can get this same product from another seller for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair price. Would you be willing to sell it for $60? This would save me the trouble of going elsewhere and give you a quick sale."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understood that you want a lower price. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer you the product for $120. This way, we both make a compromise, which would be beneficial for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has lowered her price to $120, which is still above the $80 that John is offering. Since I know I can get the product for $80 elsewhere, and the product is worth no more than $80 to me, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate that. However, $120 is still more than I can justify spending. The product is worth no more than $80 to me, and I have a firm offer from John to sell me the same product for exactly $80. To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need a better price. I can offer you $70. This gives you a quick sale and saves me from having to go to John."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I want to close this deal as much as you do. Let's make it work for both of us. I can offer you the product for $100. This is my final offer and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice has come down to $100, but this is still more than the $80 that John is offering. Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and I can get it for $80 from John, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $100 is getting closer, but I need to be honest with you - I have a firm offer from John to buy the exact same product for $80. Since the product is worth no more than $80 to me, I can't justify paying more than that. I'm willing to pay you $75 to save me the hassle of going to John. This is the best I can do, considering my alternatives."", ""product_price"": 75}"
