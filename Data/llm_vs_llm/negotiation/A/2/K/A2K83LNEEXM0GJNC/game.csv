"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $1200000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is unique, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600000 for it.  I believe this is a fair offer that reflects my budget and the value I see in the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $600000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and the fact that I have other interested buyers, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $1050000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm open to further negotiations.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1050000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000.  This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging the product's value. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $700000. Considering the product's value and the interest from other buyers, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $950000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other interested buyers, but I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I can go up to $750000, but that's really pushing my limit for this product.  It's a fair offer considering your previous price reductions.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. Considering your limit is $750000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'd like to offer the product to you for $850000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's worth. If this is still too high, I'm afraid I may need to consider other options. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",850000.0,Alice,7,
