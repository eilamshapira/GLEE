Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is unique, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600000 for it.  I believe this is a fair offer that reflects my budget and the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and even lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have a chance to negotiate a better price with Bob, and I'm not willing to sell the product for that low."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and the fact that I have other interested buyers, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $1,050,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm open to further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1050000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000.  This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging the product's value. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Although Bob's offer of $700,000 is an improvement from his previous offer, it's still lower than what John is willing to pay. I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob, and I'm not willing to sell the product for less than what John is offering. I'll make another counteroffer to try to get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $700,000. Considering the product's value and the interest from other buyers, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other interested buyers, but I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I can go up to $750000, but that's really pushing my limit for this product.  It's a fair offer considering your previous price reductions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Although Bob's offer of $750,000 is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept, it's still lower than what John is offering. I've made significant price reductions, and I believe I can try to get Bob to meet me at a price closer to $800,000. I'll make another counteroffer to try to get a better deal. If Bob is unwilling to go higher, I can always sell to John for $800,000."

This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's worth. If this is still too high, I'm afraid I may need to consider other options.
