Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $600000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and the fact that I have other interested buyers, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $1050000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price.

Round 5

# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for increasing your offer. I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $700000. Considering the product's value and the interest from other buyers, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'd like to offer it to you for $950000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have other interested buyers, but I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. Considering your limit is $750000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'd like to offer the product to you for $850000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's worth. If this is still too high, I'm afraid I may need to consider other options. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John at $800,000."
