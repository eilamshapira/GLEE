"Hello Bob, I hope you're doing well. I have a premium product that I believe would be of great value to you. Based on its unique features and market potential, I'm offering it at $3000000. This is a high-quality investment with significant returns. What do you think?",3000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was looking to spend no more than $750000. I believe this amount is more in line with my budget and the market value. Would you be open to negotiating the price down to this level?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $750000 is significantly below the value of this product. I understand you have budget constraints, but I can't go below $2200000 for this premium offering. The product has exceptional features and market potential that justify this valuation. I'm willing to negotiate further, but need to stay within a reasonable range of its true value.",2200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. However, $2200000 is still quite steep for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $900000. I believe this price point is more realistic for my budget and the current market conditions. Let's find some middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $900000, but that's still below what I can accept for this product. I understand budget constraints, but I need to emphasize that I have another buyer, John, who's already committed to $1000000. Given our negotiation so far, I'm willing to come down to $1800000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This product truly delivers exceptional value at this price point.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility in bringing the price down to $1800000. However, I need to stay within my budget constraints. I'm willing to raise my offer to $1100000. This price point aligns better with my financial goals and the potential returns I anticipate from the product. Can we find a compromise around this figure?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to see we're making progress in our negotiation. Your offer of $1100000 is getting closer to what I can accept, and I appreciate that you've increased your budget. Given the exceptional quality and potential of this product, I'm willing to meet you at $1500000. This represents a 50% reduction from my initial offer and is a fair price considering the product's true value. I believe this can work for both of us while ensuring you receive excellent value for your investment.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
