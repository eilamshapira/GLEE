Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was looking to spend no more than $750000. I believe this amount is more in line with my budget and the market value. Would you be open to negotiating the price down to this level?

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5

I understand budget constraints, but I need to emphasize that I have another buyer, John, who's already committed to $1,000,000.
