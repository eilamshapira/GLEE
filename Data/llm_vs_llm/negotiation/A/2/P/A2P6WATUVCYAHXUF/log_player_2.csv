Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was looking to spend no more than $750,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $750000 is significantly below the value of this product. I understand you have budget constraints, but I can't go below $2200000 for this premium offering. The product has exceptional features and market potential that justify this valuation. I'm willing to negotiate further, but need to stay within a reasonable range of its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. However, $2,200,000 is still quite steep for me. I'm willing to raise my offer to $900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer to $900000, but that's still below what I can accept for this product. I understand budget constraints, but I need to emphasize that I have another buyer, John, who's already committed to $1000000. Given our negotiation so far, I'm willing to come down to $1800000, which represents a significant discount from my initial offer. This product truly delivers exceptional value at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility in bringing the price down to $1,800,000. However, I need to stay within my budget constraints. I'm willing to raise my offer to $1,100,000. This price point aligns better with my financial goals and the potential returns I anticipate from the product. Can we find a compromise around this figure?"",""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to see we're making progress in our negotiation. Your offer of $1100000 is getting closer to what I can accept, and I appreciate that you've increased your budget. Given the exceptional quality and potential of this product, I'm willing to meet you at $1500000. This represents a 50% reduction from my initial offer and is a fair price considering the product's true value. I believe this can work for both of us while ensuring you receive excellent value for your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
