"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $100 to me
2. Alice's offer is $140, which is significantly above my maximum value
3. John is offering the same product for $100, which matches my maximum value
4. Alice's initial offer is well above both my maximum value and her own value ($120)

I should either reject the offer to negotiate for a better price or buy from John. Since John's price ($100) is already at my maximum value, and there's no guarantee Alice would go below this price, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
