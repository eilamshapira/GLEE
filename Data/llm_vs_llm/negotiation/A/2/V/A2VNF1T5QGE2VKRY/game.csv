"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market, however, the intrinsic value of this product is much higher. I could consider letting it go for $900000. This is a significant discount on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
