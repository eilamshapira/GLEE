"Hello Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you today. It's a high-quality item that I'm selling for $12000. I believe this is a fair market price for such a valuable product. Let me know if you're interested.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for presenting your offer. While I recognize the value of the product,  $12000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $6000? I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be transparent - the product is worth no less than $10000 to me, which is my absolute minimum selling price. I have another buyer, John, ready to purchase at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $11000, which is still below my initial offer. This represents my best effort to meet you partway while respecting the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $11000 is still quite a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $7500? That's a significant investment on my part, but I'm willing to make it if we can close this deal.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the improved offer. However, I must be frank with you - this product costs me $10000, which is my absolute bottom line. I cannot sell below this price as I would be taking a loss. I have John ready to purchase at exactly $10000, but I'm still willing to give you priority if you can meet this price. I can offer $10000 as my final price - this is the lowest I can possibly go while still covering my costs.",10000.0,Alice,5,
