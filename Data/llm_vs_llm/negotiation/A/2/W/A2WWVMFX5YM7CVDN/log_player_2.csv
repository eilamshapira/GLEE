"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I'd like to offer you today. It's a high-quality item that I'm selling for $12000. I believe this is a fair market price for such a valuable product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Let's start the negotiation. Alice's initial offer is way above my budget.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for presenting your offer. While I recognize the value of the product,  $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation."",
 ""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 
I'm starting with a low offer to see how much negotiating room there is.  I'm aiming to stay well below my $8,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your interest. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be transparent - the product is worth no less than $10000 to me, which is my absolute minimum selling price. I have another buyer, John, ready to purchase at that price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I can come down to $11000, which is still below my initial offer. This represents my best effort to meet you partway while respecting the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice is playing hardball, but she's willing to negotiate.  Her mentioning another buyer, John, seems like a tactic to pressure me. I'll counteroffer again, still staying below my $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $11,000 is still quite a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a significant investment on my part, but I'm willing to make it if we can close this deal."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

I'm inching closer to my $8,000 limit but trying to give the impression I'm stretching my budget. Let's see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the improved offer. However, I must be frank with you - this product costs me $10000, which is my absolute bottom line. I cannot sell below this price as I would be taking a loss. I have John ready to purchase at exactly $10000, but I'm still willing to give you priority if you can meet this price. I can offer $10000 as my final price - this is the lowest I can possibly go while still covering my costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

Alice is sticking to her $10,000 minimum, and it's clear she won't budge.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $8,000.  I'll save $2,000, and that's a deal I can live with."
