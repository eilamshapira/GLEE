Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically. 

Since the product is worth $80 to Bob, and I know I can definitely sell it to John for $80, I should offer it to Bob for slightly more than $80. This way, if Bob accepts, I make more than my minimum, and if he rejects, I still get $80 from John.
