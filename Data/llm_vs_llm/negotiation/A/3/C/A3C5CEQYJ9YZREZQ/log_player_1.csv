Send your offer to Bob.,"Since I know the product is worth $100 to Bob and $150 to me, I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I don't go below my minimum value.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $80 is well below my minimum acceptable value of $150, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $150, there's no reason to accept Bob's low offer or continue negotiating. The best decision is to sell to John.
