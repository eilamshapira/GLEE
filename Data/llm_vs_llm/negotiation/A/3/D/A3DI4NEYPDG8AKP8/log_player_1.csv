Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll send my offer to Bob.

Based on the information provided, I need to consider that:
- The product is worth at least $15,000 to me
- The product is worth $8,000 to Bob
- If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000

Since the product is only worth $8,000 to Bob, he won't rationally pay more than that. Additionally, I already have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, which is my minimum acceptable value.

Given these constraints, there's no price point where both Bob and I can benefit from this transaction. The logical decision is to offer Bob a price that reflects my true minimum acceptable value.
