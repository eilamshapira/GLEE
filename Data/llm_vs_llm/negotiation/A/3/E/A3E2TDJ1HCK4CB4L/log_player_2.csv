"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer carefully.

Current offer from Alice: $1,400,000
Product value to me: No more than $1,200,000
John's standing offer: $1,200,000

Alice's offer is $200,000 more than the maximum I'm willing to pay, and it's $200,000 more than John's price. There's no reason to accept this offer when I have a better alternative.

Since I can always fall back on John's offer, I should try negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a better price than $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to Alice that gives us both room to negotiate.

{""product_price"": $950,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to evaluate Alice's updated offer.

Current offer from Alice: $1,350,000
Product value to me: No more than $1,200,000
John's standing offer: $1,200,000

Alice has reduced her price by $50,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, her offer is still $150,000 more than John's price and above my maximum value. There's no reason to accept this offer when I have a better alternative with John.

I should continue negotiating with Alice to see if she'll reduce her price below John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll adjust my counteroffer to move closer to a middle ground while still aiming for a price better than John's offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I need to evaluate Alice's latest offer.

Current offer from Alice: $1,300,000
Product value to me: No more than $1,200,000
John's standing offer: $1,200,000

Alice has reduced her price again, now to $1,300,000. While she's moving in the right direction, her offer is still $100,000 higher than John's price and exceeds my maximum value. There's no reason to accept this offer when I have a better alternative with John.

Since we're on round 5 out of 10 possible rounds, I still have time to continue negotiating with Alice to see if she'll come down further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer to show good faith in the negotiation while still aiming for a price better than John's option.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Current offer from Alice: $1,250,000
Product value to me: No more than $1,200,000
John's standing offer: $1,200,000

Alice has reduced her price to $1,250,000, which is now only $50,000 higher than John's price. However, her offer still exceeds my maximum value of $1,200,000, and I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at exactly $1,200,000.

Since Alice has been consistently moving down in price, I'll continue negotiating to see if she'll make an offer below John's price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice has been consistently moving down in price and we're getting closer to an agreement, I'll increase my offer further to show I'm negotiating in good faith.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,210,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,210,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has reduced her price to $1,210,000, which is now only $10,000 higher than John's price. However, her offer still exceeds my maximum value of $1,200,000, and I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at exactly $1,200,000.

We're now at round 9 of 10, and Alice is close to John's price, but still above it. Since I can buy from John for $1,200,000, which is at my maximum value, there's no reason to pay Alice $10,000 more.

I'll make one final attempt to negotiate with Alice.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since this is the final round of negotiation and Alice's price is now very close to John's, I'll make my final offer just slightly below John's price to give Alice an incentive to accept.
