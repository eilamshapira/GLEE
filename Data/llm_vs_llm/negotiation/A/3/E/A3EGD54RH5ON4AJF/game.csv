"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it for $120. This is a fair price considering the quality and value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice, but I think $120 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. How about we proceed with this price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I cannot accept $80 as the product is worth more to me than that. Since the product is worth $100 to you as well, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. This is already a reduction from my initial offer and represents good value.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $110 is still higher than what I'm aiming for. Let's settle for $90 instead. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,4,
