Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my first offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob! I'm selling this fantastic product. Given its quality, I'm offering it to you for a special price."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! However, $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Okay, considering Bob's offer of $90, I have a few options. I need to weigh them carefully. Selling to John guarantees $80, but I know Bob values the product at $120. I think I can get a slightly better deal from Bob.

My decision is to **RejectOffer** and make a counteroffer.
