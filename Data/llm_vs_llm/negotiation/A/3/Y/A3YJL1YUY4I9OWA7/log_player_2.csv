"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I notice that Alice's offer is exactly $1,500,000, which is the same price that John is offering and also the maximum value the product is worth to me.

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price of $1,500,000, there's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other. In this situation, I would accept Alice's offer since it's already on the table and there's no benefit to rejecting it or specifically going to John.
