"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10500.  This is still a great value for you considering how much this product is worth to you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10500, but I'm still hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
