"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can still potentially get a better deal with Alice.  Rejecting her offer gives you the chance to counteroffer and try to get the price closer to your desired range (below $1,000,000). While there's a risk Alice won't accept your counteroffer, it's worth trying before resorting to John's higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's price, but it's still above her minimum acceptable price ($800,000). This makes it a reasonable starting point for negotiations. Hopefully, Alice will see this as a good compromise and accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000. While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and you risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting her offer secures the product at a price you're comfortable with."
