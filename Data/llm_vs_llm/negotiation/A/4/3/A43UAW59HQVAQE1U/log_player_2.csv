(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","The product is worth no more than $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $200. That's way too high. I'm not paying that much. John is offering it for $80, which is my maximum acceptable price.
