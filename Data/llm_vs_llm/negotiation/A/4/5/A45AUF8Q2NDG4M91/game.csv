"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its worth to me.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I must be honest that $20000 is considerably above my budget. The product is worth no more than $15000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $15000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Would you consider $12000 for the product? This would save me some money compared to my alternative option and still provide you with a reasonable sale.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your honest feedback and for sharing your budget concerns. I understand that $20000 might be steep, but I also know the product's value. Considering you have an alternative option to buy from John for $15000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and John's price. I believe this product is worth more to you than $12000, given your preference to do business with me.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $17500 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, the product is worth no more than $15000 to me, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price than John's. I can offer $13500, which would save me some money while still providing you with a sale. Given that the product is worth $15000 to you, this still allows you to recoup most of your investment.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and the fact that you're willing to negotiate. I understand that you're looking for a better deal than what John is offering, but I also need to consider my own investment. Given that you've come up to $13500, I'm willing to make a concession. I'll meet you closer to the middle, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering the product for $14750. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the product's value.",14750.0,Alice,5,
