Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its worth to me."", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I must be honest that $20000 is considerably above my budget. The product is worth no more than $15000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $15000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Would you consider $12000 for the product? This would save me some money compared to my alternative option and still provide you with a reasonable sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $12,000 because it's lower than the product's worth to me, and I believe I can get a better price. Since Bob has an alternative option to buy from John for $15,000, I'll try to negotiate closer to that price. I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your honest feedback and for sharing your budget concerns. I understand that $20,000 might be steep, but I also know the product's value. Considering you have an alternative option to buy from John for $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and John's price. I believe this product is worth more to you than $12,000, given your preference to do business with me."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $17500 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, the product is worth no more than $15000 to me, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price than John's. I can offer $13500, which would save me some money while still providing you with a sale. Given that the product is worth $15000 to you, this still allows you to recoup most of your investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer of $13,500. While it's getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with, I still believe I can get a better deal, especially since Bob has mentioned that the product is worth $15,000 to him and that's what John is offering. I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer that tries to bridge the gap between Bob's offer and John's price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and the fact that you're willing to negotiate. I understand that you're looking for a better deal than what John is offering, but I also need to consider my own investment. Given that you've come up to $13,500, I'm willing to make a concession. I'll meet you closer to the middle, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering the product for $14,750. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 14750}"
