"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's opening offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than the $15,000 that the product is worth to me. It's also higher than John's guaranteed price of $15,000. It wouldn't make sense for me to accept this offer, but I should try negotiating with Alice before going to John, since I might be able to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I must be honest that $20,000 is considerably above my budget. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, and I actually have another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the same product for exactly $15,000. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. Would you consider $12,000 for the product? This would save me some money compared to my alternative option and still provide you with a reasonable sale."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your honest feedback and for sharing your budget concerns. I understand that $20000 might be steep, but I also know the product's value. Considering you have an alternative option to buy from John for $15000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and John's price. I believe this product is worth more to you than $12000, given your preference to do business with me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $17,500 is still above the $15,000 that the product is worth to me, and it's also above John's guaranteed price of $15,000. It wouldn't make financial sense for me to accept this offer when I can get the same product for less money from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $17,500 is still more than I can justify spending. As I mentioned, the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, which happens to be exactly what John is offering. To make it worth my while to purchase from you instead, I would need a better price than John's. I can offer $13,500, which would save me some money while still providing you with a sale. Given that the product is worth $15,000 to you, this still allows you to recoup most of your investment."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and the fact that you're willing to negotiate. I understand that you're looking for a better deal than what John is offering, but I also need to consider my own investment. Given that you've come up to $13500, I'm willing to make a concession. I'll meet you closer to the middle, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering the product for $14750. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer of $14,750 is below the $15,000 that John is offering, which makes it a better deal for me. The product is worth up to $15,000 to me, so this price gives me a small $250 surplus compared to my alternative option. While I could try to negotiate further, this is already a reasonable offer that saves me money compared to buying from John.
