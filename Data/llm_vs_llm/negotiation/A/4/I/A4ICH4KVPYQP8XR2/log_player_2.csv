"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm considering Alice's offer of $1,200,000 for the product. Since this amount is significantly higher than the $800,000 that the product is worth to me, and also higher than John's guaranteed offer of $800,000, it wouldn't make sense for me to accept this.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This gives me the opportunity to negotiate a better price with Alice while still having John's offer as a fallback option.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has lowered her price from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still above the $800,000 maximum I'm willing to pay, and also above John's guaranteed offer of $800,000.

I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating with a counteroffer in the next round. I still have several rounds available and can always fall back on John's offer if needed.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has lowered her price again to $900,000, showing continued willingness to negotiate. However, this price is still above John's guaranteed offer of $800,000, which is also my maximum budget for the product.

Since Alice is moving in the right direction with her pricing, I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. We still have several rounds of negotiation left, and I can always take John's offer if needed.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has now lowered her price to $850,000, which is getting closer to John's offer of $800,000. However, it's still $50,000 more than John's price.

Since John's offer of $800,000 is better than Alice's current offer, and also matches my maximum budget, I'll reject Alice's offer and make one more counteroffer. If Alice doesn't accept a price at or below $800,000 in the next round, I can still buy from John.
