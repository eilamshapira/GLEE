"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll start with a lower price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $100. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget, but this product truly carries significant value. How about we settle at $120? Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's new offer of $120 is exactly at my maximum budget, and I also have the option to buy the product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in continuing to negotiate with Alice. I might as well accept Alice's offer or buy from John. However, since I've already invested time in negotiating with Alice, I'll choose to accept her offer.
