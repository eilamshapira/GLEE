"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller offering the same product for $15000. I would like to work with you, but I need a much more competitive price. Would you consider $12000 for the product? This would give me a reason to choose you over the other seller.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate. While $12000 is significantly lower than my initial asking price, I understand you see value in this product. Let's meet in the middle; how about $20000? This price reflects the true worth of what I'm offering while recognizing your budget concerns.",20000.0,Alice,3,
