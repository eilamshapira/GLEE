Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is significantly above my budget. I have another seller offering the same product for $15000. I would like to work with you, but I need a much more competitive price. Would you consider $12000 for the product? This would give me a reason to choose you over the other seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
