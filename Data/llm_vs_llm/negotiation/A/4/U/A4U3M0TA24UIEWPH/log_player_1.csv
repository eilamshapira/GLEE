Send your offer to Bob.,"Given that the product is worth $1,500,000 to me and $1,200,000 to Bob, I'll start with a relatively high offer but leave some room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 1,700,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is below my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000), and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $1,500,000, it makes the most sense to sell to John. This will ensure I get my minimum value and avoid further negotiation that's unlikely to reach a satisfactory outcome since Bob values the product at only $1,200,000.
