"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum value and John's offer, the rational decision would be to buy from John.

John's price ($800,000) matches my maximum valuation and is $400,000 less than Alice's offer ($1,200,000). This will help me achieve my goal of buying the product while saving as much money as possible.
