"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $100 against my alternatives.

Looking at my situation:
- The product is worth no more than $80 to me
- Alice is offering it for $100
- John (alternative seller) is offering it for $80

Since Alice's price ($100) exceeds both the value to me ($80) and John's price ($80), the rational choice is to reject Alice's offer and buy from John instead.
