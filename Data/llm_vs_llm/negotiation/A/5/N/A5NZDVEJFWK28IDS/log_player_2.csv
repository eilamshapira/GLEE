(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","The product is worth no more than $100 to me. Alice's initial offer is $150, which is too high. Buying from John costs $100, so any negotiation strategy should aim to get a price below that. Since this is the first round, there's plenty of time to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, my goal is to get the price as low as possible, but still make it appealing enough for Alice to consider. I'll start with a low counteroffer to test the waters.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice is moving down, which is good. I will move up a little from my last offer but still keep it significantly lower than John's price.
