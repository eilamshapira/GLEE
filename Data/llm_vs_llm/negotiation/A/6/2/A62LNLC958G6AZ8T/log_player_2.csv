"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I believe this product would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you at a competitive price considering its benefits and quality. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer is at the maximum price I'm willing to pay ($12,000), and I also have the option to buy the product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in accepting Alice's offer immediately without trying to negotiate a better price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer in the hopes of getting a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, in the hopes of anchoring the negotiation at a lower price point. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll aim for a price that is substantially below my maximum budget of $12,000.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. Given the product's value and the potential benefits you can gain, I'd like to suggest a middle ground. How about we agree on $10000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has made a counteroffer of $10,000, which is still below my maximum budget of $12,000 but higher than my initial counteroffer of $8,000. Since Alice has already come down from her initial offer of $12,000 to $10,000, it shows that she is willing to negotiate. However, I still want to try to get a better deal.

I'll reject Alice's current offer and make another counteroffer, trying to meet somewhere in between my previous offer and Alice's current offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

And I'll send a new counteroffer to Alice:

{""message"": ""Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
