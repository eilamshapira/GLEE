"Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Given Alice's offer is $25,000, which is higher than both the maximum value to me ($10,000) and John's guaranteed price ($10,000), it wouldn't make economic sense to accept it. Since John is offering the product at exactly the maximum value I'm willing to pay, and any counteroffer to Alice would need to be below $10,000 to be advantageous to me, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
