"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, but $20000 is way above what I'm willing to pay. How about $12000 for this item? I believe that's a fair offer given my budget, and I'd love to complete our deal at that price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $12000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. How about we meet in the middle at $16000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
