(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly the same as John's guaranteed offer ($800,000), and it's also my minimum acceptable price, I should try to negotiate for a better price with Bob first. We still have several rounds left, and I might be able to secure a higher price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a new counteroffer in the next round."
