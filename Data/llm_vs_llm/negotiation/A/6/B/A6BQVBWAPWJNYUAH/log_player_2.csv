"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice's opening offer is the maximum I'm willing to pay. There's no room for negotiation upward. By rejecting, I signal that I'm looking for a lower price and open the door for a better deal. It's highly unlikely Alice would accept an offer lower than her initial price in the first round anyway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a strong counter-offer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and John's price.  This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below my maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** While Alice moved closer to my desired price range, there's still potential for negotiation. A $200,000 difference remains between her offer and John's price. It's worth another round to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:** I am increasing my previous offer slightly, signaling willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly lower than both Alice's current offer and John's price. This keeps the negotiation moving and allows room for Alice to potentially meet in the middle."
