Hi Bob! I have a great product for you. I'm offering it at a price of $200. Let me know if you're interested.,200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $50 for it. Let me know if we can work something out.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand $200 might be high, but $50 is too low for this product. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $175. Let me know if that works for you.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer, but $175 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, how about $75? I think that's a fair price considering my budget constraints. Let me know if we can work something out.",75.0,Bob,4,
