"Hi Bob! I'm selling this amazing product. Considering its quality and value, I think a fair price would be $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I think the product is great, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the interest, Bob! I appreciate the offer, but $60 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand that $60 was a bit low, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and yours, so how about $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Okay, Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal. How about $85? That's still a bit above my minimum, but I'm willing to budge a bit to close the deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $85 is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still trying to save a bit more. Since you're close to your minimum, I'll meet you in the middle between $75 and $85. How about $80?",80.0,Bob,6,
