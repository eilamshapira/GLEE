Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about a strategic price for the offer. The product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $15,000. Since I don't know Bob's maximum valuation, I should set a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price to maximize my potential profit, while still keeping it reasonable enough that Bob might accept.
