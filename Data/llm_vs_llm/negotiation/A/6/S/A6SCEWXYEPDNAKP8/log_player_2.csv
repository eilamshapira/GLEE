"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since the product is only worth $100 to me, and I can buy it from John for $100, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $120. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to get a better price from Alice. If negotiations don't go well, I can always fall back on John's $100 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 80}

I'll offer $80. This is below the $100 I'm willing to pay and gives room for negotiation. If Alice rejects, we can potentially meet somewhere in the middle between $80 and $100. If negotiations don't work out, I still have the option to buy from John at $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Since Alice's offer ($105) is still above John's price ($100), and the product is only worth $100 to me, it makes the most sense to buy from John. While Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, there's no reason to pay more than $100 when I have a guaranteed option to buy at $100 from John."
