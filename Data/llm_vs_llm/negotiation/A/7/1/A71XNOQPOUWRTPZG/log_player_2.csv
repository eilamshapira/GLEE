"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to you. It's worth at least $1500000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1650000. This represents a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a wise investment.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to me and Alice is offering it for $1,650,000, which is more than its worth to me, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,500,000, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay.
