Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than to Bob.  This will give us room to negotiate, and I can still get a good deal while leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I will counteroffer, but I need to be careful not to drop too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

This counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still more than Bob is currently offering. I'm trying to find a middle ground while still getting a decent price."
