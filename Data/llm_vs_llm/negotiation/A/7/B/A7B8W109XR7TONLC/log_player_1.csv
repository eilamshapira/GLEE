Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of a lower price point. Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to propose a counteroffer.

I'll accept Bob's offer. I'm happy with the profit, even if it's not as high as I initially hoped.
