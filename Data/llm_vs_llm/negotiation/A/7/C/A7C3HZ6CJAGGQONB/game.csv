"Alice,  $2500000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand you have a budget. However, $1000000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I value this product at no less than $1200000. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1500000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's close this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
