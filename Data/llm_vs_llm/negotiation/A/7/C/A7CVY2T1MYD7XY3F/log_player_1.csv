"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than the minimum value I have for the product ($15,000) and also lower than what the product is worth to him ($12,000), I will reject his offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

My counteroffer will be $17,000, trying to maximize my earnings while still being in the realm of what could be considered reasonable given the product's worth to Bob.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $9,000 is still lower than what I'm aiming for, but it's slightly better than his previous offer. However, it's still far from the product's worth to me ($15,000) and even from what it's worth to him ($12,000).

I'll reject his offer again and try to meet him halfway between my last offer and his last offer, or slightly lower, to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.

My counteroffer will be $16,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $10,000 is getting closer to a reasonable price, but it's still $5,000 less than what the product is worth to me, and $2,000 less than what it's worth to him.

At this point, I'm starting to think that Bob might not be willing to meet me at a price that I'm comfortable with. Since I have the option to sell the product to John for $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to consider that option seriously.

However, I'll make one more attempt to negotiate with Bob. I'll lower my price slightly, to $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell the product to John.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer of $11,000 is still $4,000 less than what the product is worth to me. We're running out of rounds, and I don't think Bob is going to meet me at my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.

At this point, I think it's time to stop negotiating with Bob and sell the product to John for $15,000, which is a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price.
