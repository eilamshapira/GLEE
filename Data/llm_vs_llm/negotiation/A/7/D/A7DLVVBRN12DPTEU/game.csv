"Hi Bob, I appreciate your response, but $7000 is quite low for this product. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $10500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it can deliver to you. Let me know your thoughts!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9200. I'd like to propose a price of $8100.
