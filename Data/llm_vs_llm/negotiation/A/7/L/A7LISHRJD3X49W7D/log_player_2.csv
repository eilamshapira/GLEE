"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that I believe is worth at least $1000000 to you. I am willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a substantial discount considering the value it offers.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay the full market price.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth $1,000,000 to me (maximum value)
2. Alice is offering it for $950,000
3. John's fixed price is $1,000,000

Alice's offer saves me $50,000 compared to John's price, and it's below my maximum value. Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice.
