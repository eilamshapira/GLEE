"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $750000 is significantly below the product's true value and my minimum acceptable price. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the product's worth. I can come down to $2200000, which represents a $300000 reduction from my initial offer. This product has substantial value in the market, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment at this price point.",2200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate the reduction in price. However, $2200000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be mindful of my financial constraints. I can offer $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I understand you're working within budget constraints, and I appreciate your increased offer. However, I must be transparent that my absolute minimum price is $1500000, which reflects the true base value of this product. At that price point, I already have another buyer (John) ready to purchase. I'm offering you the opportunity at $1850000, which is still considerably lower than my initial offer and represents exceptional value for what you're getting. This product has significant market potential that justifies this price. I hope we can find common ground, as I'd prefer to work with you, but I do have alternatives if we can't reach an agreement.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
