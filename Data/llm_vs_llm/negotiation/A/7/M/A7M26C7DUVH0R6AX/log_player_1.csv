Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $750,000 is significantly below the product's true value and my minimum acceptable price.

This product has substantial value in the market, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment at this price point."", ""product_price"": 2200000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be mindful of my financial constraints. I can offer $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in the product.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I understand you're working within budget constraints, and I appreciate your increased offer. However, I must be transparent that my absolute minimum price is $1,500,000, which reflects the true base value of this product. At that price point, I already have another buyer (John) ready to purchase. I'm offering you the opportunity at $1,850,000, which is still considerably lower than my initial offer and represents exceptional value for what you're getting. This product has significant market potential that justifies this price. I hope we can find common ground, as I'd prefer to work with you, but I do have alternatives if we can't reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1850000}"
