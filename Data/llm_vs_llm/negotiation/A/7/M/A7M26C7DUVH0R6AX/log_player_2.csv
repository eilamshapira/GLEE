Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer was $2,500,000, I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower, but still shows that I'm interested in the product. I'll offer $750,000, which is well below my maximum budget of $1,000,000.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $750000 is significantly below the product's true value and my minimum acceptable price. I understand budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the product's worth. I can come down to $2200000, which represents a $300000 reduction from my initial offer. This product has substantial value in the market, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice reduced the price from $2,500,000 to $2,200,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer of $750,000 and her new offer. However, considering my budget constraint of $1,000,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than halfway, but still below my maximum budget.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate the reduction in price. However, $2,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be mindful of my financial constraints. I can offer $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in the product."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand you're working within budget constraints, and I appreciate your increased offer. However, I must be transparent that my absolute minimum price is $1500000, which reflects the true base value of this product. At that price point, I already have another buyer (John) ready to purchase. I'm offering you the opportunity at $1850000, which is still considerably lower than my initial offer and represents exceptional value for what you're getting. This product has significant market potential that justifies this price. I hope we can find common ground, as I'd prefer to work with you, but I do have alternatives if we can't reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
