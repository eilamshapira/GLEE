Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $12,000 to him, and I need to get at least $12,000, I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $12,000, it makes sense to reject Bob's low offer. However, rather than continue negotiating with Bob when I have a sure deal at my minimum price, I'll take the guaranteed option.
