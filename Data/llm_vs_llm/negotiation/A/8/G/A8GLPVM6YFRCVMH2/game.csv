"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find $1100000 to be quite high for this product. Given current market conditions and comparable alternatives, I would be willing to pay $700000 for the product. This is a fair price that would still provide you with a reasonable profit. Let me know if this works for you.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $700000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's unique features and its value to you, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $1050000, which is still a competitive price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
