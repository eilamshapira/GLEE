Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I've set a competitive price that I believe reflects its true value. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 1,100,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find $1100000 to be quite high for this product. Given current market conditions and comparable alternatives, I would be willing to pay $700000 for the product. This is a fair price that would still provide you with a reasonable profit. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me, and I have a better alternative with John, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price. 

My counteroffer:
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's unique features and its value to you, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000, which is still a competitive price."", ""product_price"": 1,050,000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.
