"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I've set a competitive price that I believe reflects its true value. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer of $1,100,000 is significantly above my maximum value of $800,000. It wouldn't make sense to accept this offer when I can either:
1. Make a counteroffer to try to get a better price from Alice, or
2. Buy from John for $800,000

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more reasonable price. If negotiations don't work out, I always have the option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I find $1,100,000 to be quite high for this product. Given current market conditions and comparable alternatives, I would be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price that would still provide you with a reasonable profit. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 700000}

The rationale for my counteroffer:
1. I'm starting with a price below my maximum value ($800,000) to leave room for negotiation
2. I know Alice's minimum value is $600,000 lower than her asking price, so there's significant room for negotiation
3. If Alice rejects this offer, I can still increase my price in subsequent rounds while staying under my maximum value
4. I always have the backup option of buying from John at $800,000 if negotiations with Alice don't work out"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $700000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's unique features and its value to you, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $1050000, which is still a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, I'll choose to buy from John for $800,000. Here's why:

1. Alice's new offer of $1,050,000 is still significantly above my maximum value of $800,000
2. The small reduction from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000 suggests Alice is not willing to make substantial price reductions
3. Given that Alice's product is worth $1,200,000 to her, it's unlikely she'll go below my maximum value of $800,000
4. John's offer of $800,000 is exactly at my maximum value, and it's a guaranteed deal
5. Continuing negotiations with Alice would likely be unproductive and waste time

It's best to take the guaranteed option from John rather than continue negotiations that are unlikely to result in a better deal."
