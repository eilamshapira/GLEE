"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I need to analyze this offer to maximize my savings.

Alice's offer: $11,500
My maximum value: $12,000
John's fixed price: $12,000
Alice's cost: $10,000

Alice's current offer of $11,500 is below my maximum value and $500 less than John's price. However, I might be able to negotiate an even better price with Alice since she has room to go lower (her cost is $10,000).

I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try to save more money.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice has lowered her offer from $11,500 to $11,200, which is a good sign. This new price is $800 less than John's fixed price of $12,000. While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has shown she's willing to move down in price but not as low as my initial counteroffer of $10,800.

Given that:
- Alice's new offer is $11,200
- This saves me $800 compared to John's price
- Alice has room to go lower (her cost is $10,000)
- But she's already lowered her price by $300

I'll make one more attempt to get a better price.
