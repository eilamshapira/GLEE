"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive product. Considering its value in the market, I propose a price that reflects its quality and potential benefits for you. Let me know if youâ€™re interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. Alice is offering it for $1,200,000
3. John is willing to sell it for $800,000

The logical choice is to buy from John, as:
- Alice's price ($1,200,000) is significantly above my maximum value ($800,000)
- John's price ($800,000) matches my maximum value
- Buying from Alice would mean overpaying by $400,000
