"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While I'm willing to pay up to $15,000, there's no harm in seeing if Alice might accept a lower price.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:** This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation. It allows me to gauge Alice's potential willingness to bargain."
