"Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $990,000 is very close to this maximum value, I should consider whether I can get a better deal.

However, if I reject Alice's offer, I will have to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is the maximum amount I am willing to pay. This means I won't save any money by rejecting Alice's offer.

On the other hand, accepting Alice's offer will save me $10,000 compared to buying from John.

Therefore, my decision is: {""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
