"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $2500000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the market value of similar products, I'm willing to offer $1500000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, I believe the product's value is higher than $1500000. I can reduce my initial asking price and offer it to you for $2000000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial price and better reflects the product's true value.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2000000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle. I'll offer $1750000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
