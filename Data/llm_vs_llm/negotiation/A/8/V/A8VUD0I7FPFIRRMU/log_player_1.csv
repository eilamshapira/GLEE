Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $2,500,000. This price reflects the product's true worth and potential value.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $2500000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the market value of similar products, I'm willing to offer $1500000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. The price of $1,500,000 is moving in the right direction, but it's still below what I believe is fair value for this product. Let me propose a middle ground.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, I believe the product's value is higher than $1,500,000. I can reduce my initial asking price and offer it to you for $2,000,000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial price and better reflects the product's true value.""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2000000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle. I'll offer $1750000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000

The offer of $1,750,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and represents a good outcome for both parties. While I might have preferred the $2,000,000, the risk of pushing too hard and potentially losing the deal makes accepting this offer the smart choice."
