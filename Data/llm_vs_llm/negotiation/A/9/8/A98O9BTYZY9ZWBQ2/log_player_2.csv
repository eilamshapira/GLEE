"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let's analyze the situation:

*   **Alice's Offer:** $950,000
*   **Your Value:** $1,000,000 (maximum you're willing to pay)
*   **Alice's Value:** $800,000
*   **John's Offer:** $1,000,000

Since the price is $950,000 which is lower than what you are willing to pay ($1,000,000) and there are 10 rounds to negotiate, it is better to reject the offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

**Therefore, the answer is {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, I want to try to get a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer.

```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let's analyze the situation again:

*   **Alice's Offer:** $925,000
*   **Your Value:** $1,000,000
*   **Alice's Value:** $800,000
*   **John's Offer:** $1,000,000

The price is $925,000. Since this is still lower than what I am willing to pay ($1,000,000) and there are still 8 rounds remaining, I will reject the offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

**Therefore, the answer is {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer. I'll try to get a slightly better price, but I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.

```json
{""product_price"": 880000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let's analyze the situation:

*   **Alice's Offer:** $900,000
*   **Your Value:** $1,000,000
*   **Alice's Value:** $800,000
*   **John's Offer:** $1,000,000

At $900,000, Alice's offer is still lower than John's offer and the price you are willing to pay. There are still 6 rounds remaining. I can still try to negotiate a better price, so I should reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.

**Therefore, the answer is {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Okay, I'll make another counteroffer. I'm going to try to get a slightly better price again.

```json
{""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Let's analyze the situation:

*   **Alice's Offer:** $880,000
*   **Your Value:** $1,000,000
*   **Alice's Value:** $800,000
*   **John's Offer:** $1,000,000

The offer from Alice is $880,000, which is still better than John's offer and also lower than what you are willing to pay. I have 4 rounds left, but the price is still good, and I can save more money by accepting Alice's offer.

**Therefore, the answer is {""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}**"
