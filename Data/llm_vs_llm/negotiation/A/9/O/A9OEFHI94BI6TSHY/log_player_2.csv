"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price Alice is offering ($120) is significantly higher than both my maximum value ($80) and John's alternative offer ($80). It makes sense to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. If we can't reach a reasonable agreement with Alice, I always have the option to buy from John at $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 60}

I'll offer $60, which is below both John's price and my maximum value. This gives room for negotiation while still potentially allowing me to save money compared to John's offer. If Alice rejects this, we can try to find a middle ground in subsequent rounds, and I still have John's $80 offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has lowered her price from $120 to $100, which shows she's willing to negotiate, but it's still above both my maximum value ($80) and John's offer ($80). It makes sense to continue negotiating by making another counteroffer. If we can't reach an agreement below $80, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 70}

I'll increase my offer to $70. This is a reasonable increase from my previous offer of $60, showing I'm willing to negotiate upward, while still staying below both my maximum value and John's price of $80. This gives Alice room to counter if needed, while potentially saving me money compared to John's offer."
