"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it for $25000. This is a quality product with significant value, and I'm confident it will serve your needs well. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Since Alice's offer of $25,000 exceeds the maximum value the product is worth to me ($15,000), and John is offering to sell the same product for exactly $15,000, it makes financial sense to purchase from John instead.
