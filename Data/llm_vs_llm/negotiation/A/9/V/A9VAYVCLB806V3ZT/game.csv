"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $175.  Let me know if you're interested in that.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. However, $175 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $110? Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 just doesn't work for me. Let's split the difference - how about $140?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. Could we meet at $115? I think that's a fair compromise.",115.0,Bob,6,
