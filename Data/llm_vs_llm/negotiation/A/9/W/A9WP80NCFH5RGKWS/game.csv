"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $10000 for it.  It's a unique opportunity and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $6000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $6000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $8500, as I believe this product is truly worth more. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $8500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. This is the highest I'm comfortable going, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",7500.0,Bob,4,
