"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I know you've been looking for a product like this, and I'm prepared to offer it to you at a competitive price. Given its unique features and the value it will bring to your operations, I'm offering it to you for $17000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $12,000
2. Alice is offering the product for $17,000
3. John is willing to sell it for $12,000

Alice's offer ($17,000) is:
- Higher than my maximum value ($12,000)
- Higher than John's alternative offer ($12,000)

Since:
- Alice's price is well above my maximum value
- I have a guaranteed alternative from John at exactly my maximum value
- There's no reason to pay $5,000 more for the same product

The logical choice is to buy from John.
