Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for revising your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer, hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, trying to get closer to a price that I'm comfortable with. My next offer will be $15,000. 

{""message"": ""Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're having this conversation. While $10,000 is getting closer to my target, I still believe the product is worth more.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for meeting me halfway, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $15000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher than my previous offer, but I need to stay within my means. Here's another counteroffer.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to John's offer of $12,000, and I don't know if Bob will be willing to go any higher, I think it's best to sell the product to John for $12,000, ensuring I get a slightly better price."
