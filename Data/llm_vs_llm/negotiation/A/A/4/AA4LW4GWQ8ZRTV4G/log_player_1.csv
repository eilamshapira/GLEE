Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me start with a relatively high price to test Bob's willingness to pay, while leaving room for potential negotiation.

{""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer is $100, which is exactly the same as John's guaranteed offer, and also exactly my minimum acceptable price, there's no advantage in accepting Bob's offer over selling to John. However, I believe I can get a better price from Bob through negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let me make a new counteroffer at $140, which is lower than my initial offer but still gives me a better profit than selling to John.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob has increased his offer from $100 to $110, which shows he's willing to negotiate and values the product above my minimum price. This offer is better than John's $100, but I believe there might still be room for a better price.

I'll counter with a lower price than my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's current bid.
