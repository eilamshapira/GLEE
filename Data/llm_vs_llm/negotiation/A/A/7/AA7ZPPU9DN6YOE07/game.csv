"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product and would be willing to pay $12000.  This is the maximum I can afford at this time. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $12000 is unfortunately below what I can accept for this item. The product's value to me is at least $15000, which is actually what another buyer, John, is willing to pay right now. However, I'd like to give you the opportunity to purchase it first. Would you be able to meet me at $15500? This is still a fair price given the product's quality and value.",15500.0,Alice,3,
