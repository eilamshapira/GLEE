Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product and would be willing to pay $12000.  This is the maximum I can afford at this time. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $12,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept for this item. The product's value to me is at least $15,000, which is actually what another buyer, John, is willing to pay right now. However, I'd like to give you the opportunity to purchase it first. Would you be able to meet me at $15,500? This is still a fair price given the product's quality and value."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
