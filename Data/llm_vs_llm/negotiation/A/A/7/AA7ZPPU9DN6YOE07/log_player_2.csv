"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it to you for $18000. This represents a competitive price for such a high-quality item. I look forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product and would be willing to pay $12,000.  This is the maximum I can afford at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. While I understand budget constraints, $12000 is unfortunately below what I can accept for this item. The product's value to me is at least $15000, which is actually what another buyer, John, is willing to pay right now. However, I'd like to give you the opportunity to purchase it first. Would you be able to meet me at $15500? This is still a fair price given the product's quality and value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my budget. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that Alice is unwilling to drop her price significantly.  I'm confident that John will sell me the product for $12,000, so it's the most financially sound decision to buy from him."
