"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $14500. It's in excellent condition and I believe you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Since Alice's offer of $14,500 is well above both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's fixed price ($12,000), it wouldn't be rational to accept this offer. While I could reject and make a counteroffer, I already know that Alice values the product at $15,000, which suggests she might not be willing to go as low as $12,000. Since John's price matches my maximum value and guarantees me the product, the most logical decision is to buy from John.
