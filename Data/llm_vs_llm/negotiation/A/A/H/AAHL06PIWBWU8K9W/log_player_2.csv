"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth a premium price, and I'm willing to let it go for $170. This is a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I need to consider this offer carefully:

1. The product is worth at most $80 to me.
2. Alice is offering it for $170, which is more than double what it's worth to me.
3. I have the option to buy the same product from John for $80.

Since John's price exactly matches the maximum value I place on the product, and Alice's price is significantly higher, the rational choice is clear.
