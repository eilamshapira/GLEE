"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this strategically:

1. My maximum value for the product is $120
2. Alice's offer is $110, which is below my maximum
3. Alice's cost is $80, so there's room for negotiation
4. I still have 9 more rounds to negotiate
5. John's offer ($120) is my backup but it's the highest price possible

Given these factors, I should reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price. Alice has room to go lower since her cost is $80, and I have multiple rounds to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's cost is $80 and her initial offer was $110, I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower but still reasonable. I'll start with a price closer to her cost to leave room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 90}

This offer gives Alice a $10 profit margin while saving me $30 compared to John's price. It's a reasonable starting point that leaves room for negotiation upward if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let's analyze the situation:
1. Alice has lowered her price from $110 to $105, showing willingness to negotiate
2. We still have 7 more rounds for negotiation
3. The current offer saves me $15 compared to John's price
4. There's still room for a better deal since Alice's cost is $80
5. Alice moved $5 down from her initial offer, showing she might be willing to move further

Since we still have several rounds left and Alice is showing flexibility, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further down.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice moved down $5 from her initial offer, I'll move up $5 from my initial offer. This shows I'm also willing to be flexible and meet in the middle.

{""product_price"": 95}

This offer would give Alice a $15 profit margin (still a decent profit from her $80 cost) while saving me $25 compared to John's price. It's a fair middle ground that shows I'm willing to negotiate upward from my initial offer."
