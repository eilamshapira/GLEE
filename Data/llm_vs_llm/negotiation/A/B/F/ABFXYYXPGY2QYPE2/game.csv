"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1400000 is well above what I can justify paying for this product. I have another seller, John, offering the same product for $1000000. I would like to do business with you instead, but I can only offer $850000 for the product. This provides you with an opportunity to make a sale, albeit at a lower price than you initially proposed. I look forward to your response.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but $850000 is still quite low for me. I'm willing to lower my price to $1300000 to make this deal happen. This price recognizes your budget constraints while also acknowledging the product's true value. Let's make this work for both of us!",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for lowering your price, Alice. However, $1300000 is still significantly above my budget. As I mentioned, I have John's offer of $1000000, which is my absolute maximum for this product. To give you an advantage over my alternative option, I can offer you $920000. This gives you a better deal than walking away while still being within my constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price point.",920000.0,Bob,4,
