Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1400000 is well above what I can justify paying for this product. I have another seller, John, offering the same product for $1000000. I would like to do business with you instead, but I can only offer $850000 for the product. This provides you with an opportunity to make a sale, albeit at a lower price than you initially proposed. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
**Your message to Bob:**
""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I appreciate your position, $850,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me. I'm willing to come down from my initial price, so let's meet in the middle at $1,200,000. This way, we can both walk away from the deal satisfied. Looking forward to your response.""
**Your counteroffer:**
The product price will be $1,200,000"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still quite low for me. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,300,000 to make this deal happen. This price recognizes your budget constraints while also acknowledging the product's true value. Let's make this work for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for lowering your price, Alice. However, $1300000 is still significantly above my budget. As I mentioned, I have John's offer of $1000000, which is my absolute maximum for this product. To give you an advantage over my alternative option, I can offer you $920000. This gives you a better deal than walking away while still being within my constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price point.
