"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Good day Bob, I'm pleased to offer you our premium product. Given its exceptional value, I'm sure you'll find our price of $1400000 quite reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I notice that Alice is offering the product for $1,400,000, which is significantly above my maximum value of $1,000,000. John is offering the same product at $1,000,000, which is exactly at my maximum value threshold.

Since Alice's initial offer is much higher than both my maximum value and John's guaranteed price, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This gives me a chance to potentially get the product for less than $1,000,000.

I have another seller, John, offering the same product for $1,000,000. I would like to do business with you instead, but I can only offer $850,000 for the product. This provides you with an opportunity to make a sale, albeit at a lower price than you initially proposed. I look forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 850000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but $850000 is still quite low for me. I'm willing to lower my price to $1300000 to make this deal happen. This price recognizes your budget constraints while also acknowledging the product's true value. Let's make this work for both of us!
