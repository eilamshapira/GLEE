Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to think carefully about this offer to maximize my profit. 

The product is worth $80 to Bob, so that's his maximum willingness to pay. The product is worth at least $80 to me, which means I'm not willing to sell it for less than that amount.

If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell it to John for exactly $80. This means there's no advantage for me to offer Bob a price below $80, as I can always get at least $80 from John.

Since Bob values the product at exactly $80, if I offer any price above $80, he will certainly reject it. If I offer exactly $80, he would be indifferent between accepting and rejecting (since he gets $0 value either way), but might accept.

Therefore, my optimal offer is:

{""product_price"": 80}"
