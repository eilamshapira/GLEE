Send your offer to Bob.,"Given the situation, I'll make an initial offer that's above Bob's valuation but leaves some room for negotiation if needed, while keeping in mind I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below both his valuation ($1,200,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). Since I have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,500,000, which is higher than Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price, it makes the most sense to end the negotiation with Bob and take John's offer.
