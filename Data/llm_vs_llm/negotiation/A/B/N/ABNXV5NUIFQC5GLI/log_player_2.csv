"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer of $1,650,000 is higher than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000), it doesn't make sense for me to accept this offer. Additionally, buying from John for $1,200,000 is within my budget, but I'd like to try to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is reasonable and within my budget. Since I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than that to leave room for negotiation.
