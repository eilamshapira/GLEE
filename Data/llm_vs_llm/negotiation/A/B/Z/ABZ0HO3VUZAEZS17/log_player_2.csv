"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since the offer of $12,000 is above my budget of $10,000, I will reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll start by making a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reasonable. This will give us room to negotiate and potentially find a mutually acceptable price.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. How about we settle at $10000? This is a fair compromise and still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Since Alice's new offer of $10,000 is exactly at my budget limit, and I also have the option to buy the product from John for the same price, I don't see any advantage in continuing to negotiate with Alice. In this case, I might as well buy the product from John, as it eliminates the risk of further negotiation and potential price increases.
