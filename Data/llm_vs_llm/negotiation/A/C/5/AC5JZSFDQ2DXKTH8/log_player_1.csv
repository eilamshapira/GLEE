Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm open to negotiations if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. The product seems valuable, but $2000000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $900000 for it. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is lower than what John is willing to pay ($1,000,000), and it's also lower than the product's value to me, I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I still have a chance to negotiate a better price with Bob, and if that doesn't work out, I can always sell to John.

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $900,000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. My new offer is $1,800,000. I'm open to further negotiations if needed."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, given my budget constraints, I can extend to $1000000 for the product. I hope you consider this offer as a fair middle ground.

Since Bob's new offer of $1,000,000 matches what John is willing to pay, and considering that further negotiations with Bob may not yield a better result, I'll accept Bob's offer. This way, I'll still get the same amount of money I would have gotten from John, and I won't risk losing the sale or prolonging the negotiation unnecessarily."
