"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. While it sounds interesting, $150 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget concerns, $80 is actually my absolute minimum price point. Given the quality and value of the product, I could come down to $120, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would this work better for you?",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for clarifying. I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
