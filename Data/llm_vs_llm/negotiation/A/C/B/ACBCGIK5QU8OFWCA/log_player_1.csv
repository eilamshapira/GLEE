"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product to offer you today. I believe it's a great value, and I'd like to offer it to you for $150. Would you be interested in making this purchase?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. While it sounds interesting, $150 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll send a counteroffer. $80 is the minimum I can accept, and since Bob is willing to pay that much, I believe he values the product higher. I'll try to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand budget concerns, $80 is actually my absolute minimum price point. Given the quality and value of the product, I could come down to $120, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would this work better for you?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for clarifying. I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $100. This is a good compromise that gives me $20 more than John's standing offer, and we've reached a reasonable middle ground in the negotiation."
