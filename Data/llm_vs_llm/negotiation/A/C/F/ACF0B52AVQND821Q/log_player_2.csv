"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,499,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,499,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Alice's offer ($1,499,999) is higher than both my maximum valuation ($1,000,000) and John's price ($1,000,000), it would be most logical to buy from John. Even though the option says ""RejectOffer"" is available, given that I know John's price is better, I should go directly with that option.
