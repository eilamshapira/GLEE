"Alice, thank you for your offer. My budget is a bit tighter, and I believe $8000 is a fair price given the circumstances. Let me know if you'd be willing to work with that.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is the absolute minimum value of this product to me, and I already have another buyer willing to pay that amount. Given the $10000 market value, I'm willing to come down significantly from my initial offer. How about $9000? This gives you a $1000 value while still allowing me some profit margin above my minimum.",9000.0,Alice,3,
"Alice, thanks for coming down. I appreciate the adjustment to $9000, but given my budget constraints, could we meet in the middle at $8500? I'm looking forward to a deal that works well for both of us.",,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your flexibility. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to offer $8500. Let me know if this works for you.",8500.0,Bob,4,
