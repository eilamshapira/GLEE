I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This is a significant amount of money for me, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows Bob to make a considerable profit. I believe this is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is still a good deal for me, and I believe it is a fair compromise. I'm hopeful Bob will accept this offer."
