"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you our exclusive product at a special price of $16000. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Let me analyze the situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $16,000
3. John is offering the same product for $15,000
4. If I accept Alice's offer, I would be paying $1,000 more than what the product is worth to me
5. If I buy from John, I would be paying exactly what the product is worth to me

Since Alice's offer ($16,000) is above my maximum value ($15,000), and John is offering a better price that matches my maximum value, the logical choice is to buy from John.
