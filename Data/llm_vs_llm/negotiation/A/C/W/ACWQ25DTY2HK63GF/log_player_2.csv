"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Alice's offer ($1,500,000) is higher than both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000), I'll reject this offer. If the next round of negotiation doesn't yield a better price from Alice, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 900000}

I'll make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is significantly below John's price of $1,200,000, which gives room for negotiation while potentially saving money. If Alice rejects this and counters with a price above $1,200,000, I can always go with John's offer. This opening counteroffer allows for some back-and-forth negotiation while still maintaining the possibility of a better deal than John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Alice's offer of $1,200,000. Here's why:
1. The price matches John's offer of $1,200,000
2. It equals my maximum value for the product
3. Given my previous counteroffer was rejected, it's unlikely Alice will accept an even lower price
4. Continuing negotiations might risk losing this deal, and we can't get a better price from John anyway

There's no advantage in continuing negotiations or switching to John since we've reached the best possible price given the circumstances."
