"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze this situation:

- Alice offers the product for $100
- The product is worth no more than $100 to me
- If I reject Alice's offer, I can buy from John for $100

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price ($100), and this equals the maximum value the product has to me, I'm indifferent between the two options. There's no financial advantage to choosing one over the other.
