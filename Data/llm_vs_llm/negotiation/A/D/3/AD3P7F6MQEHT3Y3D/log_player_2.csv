"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I need to consider my options carefully. 
- Alice's offer of $9,500 is actually $1,500 more than the product is worth to me (since it's worth no more than $8,000 to me).
- I can reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.
- Alternatively, I can directly buy from John for $8,000, which is the maximum I value the product.

Since Alice's initial offer is above what the product is worth to me, and I have the option to buy from John at exactly my maximum valuation, I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This gives me the opportunity to potentially get the product for less than $8,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that gives me room to negotiate but is still reasonable given that the product is worth $8,000 to Alice.

{""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I see that Alice has reduced her offer from $9,500 to $8,800, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this price is still above the $8,000 that the product is worth to me, and it's also above John's guaranteed price of $8,000.

Since I can buy the same product from John for $8,000, which matches my maximum valuation, there's no reason for me to accept Alice's higher price of $8,800. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer that's closer to what might be acceptable to both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly but keep it below John's price since there's no reason for me to pay more than $8,000.
