"Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I'd like to offer you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $6000 for the product considering its value to me. Would you be willing to sell at this price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand budget constraints, but $6000 is too low for this product. I could come down to $10000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Would this work better for you?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down to $10000, Alice. However, it's still a bit out of my budget. Could you consider $7000? That would be a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects a good value for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
