"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit high for me. Would you consider selling it for $90? This would still give you a good profit margin.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $90 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
