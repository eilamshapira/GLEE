Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit high for me. Would you consider selling it for $90? This would still give you a good profit margin. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $90 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
