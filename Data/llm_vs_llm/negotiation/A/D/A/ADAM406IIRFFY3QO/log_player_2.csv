"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this situation:

1. My maximum value for the product is $150
2. Alice's initial offer is $120
3. I know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation
4. I have John's offer of $150 as a backup
5. I still have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Alice

Alice's offer of $120 is better than John's $150, but since I know Alice's cost is $80, I can try to negotiate for a better price. There's no rush to accept this first offer, and I have nothing to lose by making a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonable but still gives me room for negotiation. Since Alice's cost is $80 and her initial offer was $120, I'll start with a price closer to her cost to leave room for meeting in the middle.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit high for me. Would you consider selling it for $90? This would still give you a good profit margin."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $90 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Let me analyze this new situation:

1. Alice has moved down from $120 to $105, showing willingness to negotiate
2. This is a $15 reduction from her initial offer
3. The price of $105 is significantly better than John's $150
4. While there might be room to negotiate further down, $105 is a reasonable price
5. It's a fair compromise between her initial $120 and my $90 offer

Given that:
- The price is well below my maximum value of $150
- It's a fair compromise between our positions
- There's risk in pushing too hard and potentially damaging the negotiation
- $105 represents a good savings compared to John's price

I'll accept this offer as it represents a good deal for me.
