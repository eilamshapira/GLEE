Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to consider my options carefully. If Bob rejects my offer, I can sell to John for $12,000. Since the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, any price above that will likely be rejected.

My best strategy is to offer Bob the product at exactly $8,000, which is the maximum he values it. If he accepts, I earn $8,000. If he rejects, I'll sell to John for $12,000. Since $12,000 is more than $8,000, I'm actually better off if Bob rejects my offer.

However, I need to make an offer to Bob as instructed, so I'll offer a price that's high enough that he'll likely reject it, allowing me to sell to John instead.
