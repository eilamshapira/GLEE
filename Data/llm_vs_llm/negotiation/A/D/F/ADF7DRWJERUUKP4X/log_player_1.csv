Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale! I'm looking to get $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $120 is a bit too high for me. I can actually get this product from John for $100. But I'd prefer to do business with you. Would you consider selling it for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","This is a tough one! Bob is offering $80, which is the bare minimum I'd accept. However, he also implies he values the product *more* than $80 because he'd ""prefer to do business"" with me even though he can get it from John for $100. This hints at a higher value to him. I also want to avoid Bob going to John.

I'm going to **reject** Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counter_offer"": 100}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better price. How about we meet in the middle at $100? I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 100}"
