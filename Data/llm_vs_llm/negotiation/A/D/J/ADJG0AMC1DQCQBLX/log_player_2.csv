Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. Her new offer of $135 is quite good. While I could try to squeeze her even further, the risk of her rejecting another counteroffer and potentially raising the price seems too high. $135 is a good price, well within my budget, and saves me $15 compared to John.
