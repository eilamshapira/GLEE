"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I need to evaluate Alice's offer of $2,000,000 against my alternatives.

Since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and John is offering to sell it for exactly $800,000, Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than both the product's value to me and my alternative option.

The rational choice is to buy from John at $800,000, which matches the maximum value of the product to me and saves me $1,200,000 compared to Alice's offer.
