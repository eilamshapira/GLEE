"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $2000000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, the starting price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm willing to pay $700000 for it. How does that sound?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your interest in the product and for making an offer. However, I must say that $700000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise and lower my initial price. I can offer it to you for $1800000, which is still a competitive price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the revised offer, but it's still outside my budget. My maximum price is $800000, as I have another option available at that price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, let's say $750000. Is this something we can agree on?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for sharing your budget constraints with me. I understand that you have another option available at $800000, and I appreciate your willingness to go a bit higher to $750000. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering your budget and the product's value, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $1500000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. If this is still not feasible, I'm open to further negotiations.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
