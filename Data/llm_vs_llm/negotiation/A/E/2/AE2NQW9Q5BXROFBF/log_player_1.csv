"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, the starting price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm willing to pay $700000 for it. How does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and even lower than what John is willing to pay, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I still have 8 rounds left to try to get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your interest in the product and for making an offer. However, I must say that $700,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise and lower my initial price. I can offer it to you for $1,800,000, which is still a competitive price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the revised offer, but it's still outside my budget. My maximum price is $800000, as I have another option available at that price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, let's say $750000. Is this something we can agree on? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still lower than what John is willing to pay, and I believe I can get a better deal. Since Bob mentioned that he has another option available at $800,000, I think there's room for further negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, trying to get closer to a price that's acceptable to both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for sharing your budget constraints with me. I understand that you have another option available at $800,000, and I appreciate your willingness to go a bit higher to $750,000. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering your budget and the product's value, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $1,500,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. If this is still not feasible, I'm open to further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
