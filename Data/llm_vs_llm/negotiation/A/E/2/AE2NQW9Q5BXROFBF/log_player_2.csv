Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your interest in the product and for making an offer. However, I must say that $700000 is a bit too low for me.

Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for sharing your budget constraints with me. I understand that you have another option available at $800000, and I appreciate your willingness to go a bit higher to $750000. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering your budget and the product's value, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $1500000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. If this is still not feasible, I'm open to further negotiations.
