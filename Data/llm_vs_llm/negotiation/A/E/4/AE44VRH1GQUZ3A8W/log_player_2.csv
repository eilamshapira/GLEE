"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a premium product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its exceptional quality and market value, I'm offering it at $950000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth and potential benefits. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $950,000
3. John is willing to sell the same product for $800,000

The logical choice would be to buy from John because:
- John's price ($800,000) matches the maximum value I place on the product
- Alice's offer ($950,000) is $150,000 more expensive than John's price
- Alice's offer is well above my maximum valuation

Therefore, I should buy from John to save money and stay within my valuation.
