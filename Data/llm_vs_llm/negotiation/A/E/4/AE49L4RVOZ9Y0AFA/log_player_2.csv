"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I notice that Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($8,000) and John's guaranteed price ($8,000). Since I can buy the product from John for $8,000 at any time, there's no reason to accept an offer that's higher than this amount.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I can buy the product from John for $8,000, I need to offer Alice less than this amount to make it worthwhile for me. I'll start with a low counteroffer to see if we can negotiate to a price that's better than John's.

{""product_price"": $5,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice has lowered her offer from $18,000 to $16,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, this is still double the price I can get from John ($8,000), and it exceeds my maximum valuation. There's no reason to accept this offer when I have a better alternative.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll increase my offer slightly, but I need to stay well below John's price of $8,000 to make this negotiation worthwhile.

{""product_price"": $5,500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice continues to lower her price, now offering $14,000, but this is still significantly higher than John's price of $8,000. Since I can buy the product from John at any time for $8,000, and that price is already at my maximum valuation, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I see that Alice is reducing her price by $2,000 in each round. I'll continue to negotiate but remain firm that my offer needs to be below John's price to be worthwhile for me.

{""product_price"": $6,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offers continue to decrease but remain substantially higher than John's price of $8,000. Since I can get the product from John for $8,000 at any time, and this price already matches my maximum valuation, there's no reason to accept Alice's current offer of $13,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I notice we're approaching the end of our negotiation rounds (10 total), and Alice's price reductions are getting smaller. I'll increase my offer again, but I need to maintain a price below John's $8,000 offer to make this worthwhile.
