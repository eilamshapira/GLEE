You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
While Alice's offer of $11,500 is less than John's price of $12,000, I can still try to get a better deal. By rejecting her first offer, I might be able to negotiate a lower price."
