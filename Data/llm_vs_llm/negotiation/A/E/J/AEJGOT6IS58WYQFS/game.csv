"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $1450000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $600000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. However, $600000 is significantly lower than my valuation. I understand that $1450000 might be too high for you, so I'm willing to lower my offer to $1200000. This is still considerably more than your counteroffer, but I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1200000.0,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for getting back to me. I understand that the initial price might be too high for you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to lower my offer to $1200000. This price still reflects the true value of the product and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1200000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $900000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
