"Alice's offer: The product price will be $240. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $240
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I need to analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $240
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John for $150

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to me (Bob), and John is willing to sell it for exactly $150, Alice's offer of $240 is significantly higher than both my maximum valuation and my alternative option.

The logical choice is to buy from John rather than accept Alice's overpriced offer.
