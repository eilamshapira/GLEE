"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. How about $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a really good product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it at that price. Let's make a deal!",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but I can get the product for $80 from another seller. How about I buy from you for $75, and we both win?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you, but $75 just isn't enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82? That would be a fair price for both of us.",82.0,Alice,5,

"We're getting there, but I think you can do a bit better. I'll buy it for $78.",78.0,Bob,6,
