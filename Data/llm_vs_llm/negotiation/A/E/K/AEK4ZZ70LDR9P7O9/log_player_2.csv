"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm open to offers, but I'm looking for at least $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Let's see if Alice can lower her price. I'm willing to spend up to $80, so let's start with a lower counteroffer.)

Counteroffer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. How about $60?"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. How about $60?"", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a really good product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it at that price. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Alice is going down in price, but $85 is still more than what John is offering. Let's counteroffer with a price lower than John's.)

Counteroffer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but I can get the product for $80 from another seller. How about I buy from you for $75, and we both win?"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but I can get the product for $80 from another seller. How about I buy from you for $75, and we both win?"", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you, but $75 just isn't enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82? That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(Alice is getting closer to John's price, but $82 is still more than what John is offering. Let's counteroffer with a price just a bit lower than John's.)

Counteroffer:
# Bob's message: We're getting there, but I think you can do a bit better. I'll buy it for $78."
