Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my counteroffer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $6,000 is significantly less than the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and the lowest I can go is $10,000."", ""product_price"": 10000}"

# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I have to stick to my budget. How about we split the difference between my previous offer and your new price?
