Send your offer to Bob.,"Okay, here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm very pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. Considering its unique qualities and the resources involved, I am offering it to you for $1,800,000."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I believe $1800000 is above what I can consider for this purchase. Based on my evaluation, I would like to offer $1000000 for the product. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Given Bob's counteroffer and my minimum value of $1,200,000, I have to consider my options carefully. I can't accept $1,000,000, as that's below my baseline. I also don't want to immediately sell to John as I can possibly get more from Bob.

Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.
