Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [briefly describe your product] that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $190. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 190
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with a higher price and negotiate down if needed. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his perceived value of the product. If he accepts immediately, you might have gone a bit low! If he rejects, you can always come down in price, knowing you have a guaranteed $120 from John.
* **Justification:** While not included in this message, it's good practice to have a justification for your price ready. This could be based on the product's features, benefits, market value, or your own cost of production (if applicable). 

Remember, this is just the opening move. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response!"
