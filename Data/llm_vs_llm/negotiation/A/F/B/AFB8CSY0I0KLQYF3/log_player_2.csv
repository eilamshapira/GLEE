"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a [briefly describe your product] that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $190. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $190. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $190
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $190 is higher than your maximum budget of $150. You know you can get the product for $150 from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price or go with your backup option."
