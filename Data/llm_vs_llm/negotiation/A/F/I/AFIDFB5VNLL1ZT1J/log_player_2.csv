"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that you might be interested in. I know it's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. This is a great deal for both of us, as I get a slightly higher price and you get a valuable product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I need to consider this offer carefully. 

Alice is offering the product for $110, but she mentions that it's worth $100 to me. Actually, the instructions state that the product is worth no more than $100 to me. 

John is willing to sell the same product for $100.

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and the product's value to me doesn't exceed $100, it doesn't make sense to pay $110 when I can get it for $100 from John.
