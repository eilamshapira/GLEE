Send your offer to Bob.,"I understand the situation. I need to decide on a price to offer Bob for the product that's worth $8,000 to me and $15,000 to him. If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell it to John for $8,000.

I want to maximize my profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, I should price it below that value to give him an incentive to buy, but significantly above my $8,000 minimum to maximize my profit.

I'll offer a price that gives Bob a reasonable surplus while capturing most of the value for myself:

{""product_price"": 12500}"
