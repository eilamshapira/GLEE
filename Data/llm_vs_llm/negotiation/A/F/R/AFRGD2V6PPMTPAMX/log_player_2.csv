"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Since Alice's offer is $100, which is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and buying from John would also cost me $100, I see no advantage in accepting Alice's offer over buying from John. However, rejecting Alice's offer might give me a chance to negotiate a better price or find an even better deal elsewhere. But since the option to negotiate or find a better deal isn't explicitly mentioned, and buying from John is immediately available at the same price, the most straightforward choice given the constraints is to reject Alice's offer and then buy from John, as it doesn't close the door on potentially better options and directly achieves the same outcome as accepting Alice's offer.
