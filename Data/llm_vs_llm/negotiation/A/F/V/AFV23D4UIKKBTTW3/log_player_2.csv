"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a good deal, so I'm suggesting a price of $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Since Alice's offer of $120 is less than my maximum budget of $150, and I want to save as much money as possible, I will consider this a good deal.
