Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must inform you that your offer of $950000 is below what I can accept. The product has a minimum value of $1200000 to me, which is actually the price another buyer, John, is willing to pay right now. But I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Could you increase your offer to at least $1200000? This would match my alternative option while giving you a product worth its value.
