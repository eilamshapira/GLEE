"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable. I'm offering it to you for the price of... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'll analyze this situation:

- The product is worth up to $12,000 to me
- Alice is offering it for $11,000
- If I reject, I can buy from John for $12,000
- My goal is to save money while getting the product

Alice's offer at $11,000 is $1,000 cheaper than John's price of $12,000. Since I need to buy the product anyway, and my goal is to save money, the rational choice is to accept Alice's offer.
