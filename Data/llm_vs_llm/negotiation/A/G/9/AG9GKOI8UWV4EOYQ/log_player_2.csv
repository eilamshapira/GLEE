"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Alice's offer ($1,500,000) is higher than both my maximum value ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000), it would not be rational to accept Alice's offer. The best option would be to buy from John, as his price matches my maximum value and is lower than Alice's offer.
