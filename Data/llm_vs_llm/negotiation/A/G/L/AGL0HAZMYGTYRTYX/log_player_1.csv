Send your offer to Bob.,"Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, and I know I can always sell it to John for $120, I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I make more than my minimum.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since I know I can sell the product to John for $120, and the product is worth at least $120 to me, I will reject Bob's offer of $90 as it's too low. There's no reason for me to accept less than $120 when I have a guaranteed buyer at that price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob countered with $90, which is well below my minimum acceptable price of $120, I'll reduce my initial offer somewhat but still maintain a price above what John is offering to leave room for potential negotiation while ensuring I make more than my guaranteed $120.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, it would not be rational to accept Bob's offer. At this point, since Bob's offers are still significantly below my minimum, it makes sense to end the negotiation and take the guaranteed $120 from John.
