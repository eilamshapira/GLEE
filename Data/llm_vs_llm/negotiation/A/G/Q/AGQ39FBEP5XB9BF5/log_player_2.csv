"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'll analyze this offer:

Alice is offering to sell me the product for $2,000,000, which is significantly higher than the $800,000 the product is worth to me. 

If I accept this offer, I would be paying $1,200,000 more than the product's value to me, which would be a very poor decision.

If I buy from John immediately, I'd pay exactly what the product is worth to me ($800,000).

The strategic move is to reject Alice's initial high offer and make a counteroffer. This gives me a chance to negotiate a better price than $800,000, potentially saving money compared to John's offer.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has only slightly reduced her price from $2,000,000 to $1,800,000, which is still much higher than the $800,000 maximum value the product has to me. This price is still $1,000,000 above what I'm willing to pay.

John's offer of $800,000 remains available and is my upper limit for what this product is worth to me. However, I still have 8 more rounds of negotiation available, so I should continue trying to negotiate with Alice to see if I can get a better price than John's offer.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has only reduced her price slightly again, from $1,800,000 to $1,700,000. This is still $900,000 above my maximum value of $800,000 for the product.

I notice that Alice's reductions are quite small (first $200,000, then $100,000), suggesting she may be starting from a very high anchor and moving down slowly. Her current offer is still more than double what the product is worth to me.

Since John's offer of $800,000 matches exactly my maximum value, and Alice seems unlikely to drop her price below $800,000 given her current negotiation approach, I should consider buying from John.

However, I still have 6 more potential rounds of negotiation. I'll make one more attempt with a higher counteroffer to signal more serious interest, but if Alice doesn't make a significant move in response, I'll go with John's offer.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice continues to reduce her price only slightly (now to $1,600,000), which is still double my maximum value of $800,000 for the product. Her pattern suggests she's unlikely to reach a price below John's offer within our remaining negotiation rounds.

Looking at the pattern:
- Initial offer: $2,000,000
- Second offer: $1,800,000 (reduced by $200,000)
- Third offer: $1,700,000 (reduced by $100,000)
- Fourth offer: $1,600,000 (reduced by $100,000)

At this rate, after 3 more rounds, her price would still be well above $1,200,000, which is far higher than John's offer.

Given the significant gap and the slow rate of concessions from Alice, the rational decision is to purchase from John instead of continuing this negotiation.
