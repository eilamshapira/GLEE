"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $18000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations if you're interested.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. The product is actually worth no more than $15000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it at exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to offer the product for $12000? This would give me some incentive to buy from you rather than John.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your honest message. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. Considering your offer and the product's value to you, I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. This way, you'll still get a better deal than buying from John, and I'll get a bit closer to the product's value.",14000.0,Alice,3,
