Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $18,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. The product is actually worth no more than $15000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it at exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to offer the product for $12000? This would give me some incentive to buy from you rather than John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob mentioned the product is worth no more than $15,000 to him and he has another seller offering it at that price, I believe there's room for negotiation. Accepting his offer of $12,000 would be the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I'd like to try to get closer to the product's value to Bob. Selling to John for $12,000 doesn't give me any advantage, so I'll try to negotiate further with Bob. 

Next, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. 

{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your honest message. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. Considering your offer and the product's value to you, I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This way, you'll still get a better deal than buying from John, and I'll get a bit closer to the product's value."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
