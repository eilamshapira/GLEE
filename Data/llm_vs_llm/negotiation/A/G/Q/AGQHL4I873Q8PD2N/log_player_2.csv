"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting with a price of $18000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I need to consider if Alice's offer of $18,000 is reasonable compared to my alternatives.

Since:
1) The product is worth no more than $15,000 to me
2) I can definitely buy from John for $15,000
3) Alice's price of $18,000 is higher than both my maximum value and my alternative option

There's no reason to accept Alice's current offer. I should either make a counteroffer or go with John's guaranteed option.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. The product is actually worth no more than $15,000 to me, and I have another seller, John, who's willing to sell it at exactly that price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if possible. Would you be willing to offer the product for $12,000? This would give me some incentive to buy from you rather than John."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your honest message. I appreciate your willingness to do business with me. Considering your offer and the product's value to you, I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. This way, you'll still get a better deal than buying from John, and I'll get a bit closer to the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice has now offered $14,000, which is $1,000 less than John's price of $15,000, and also below my maximum value for the product. This is a good deal that saves me money compared to my alternative option.
