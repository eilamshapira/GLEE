"Hello Bob, I have a high-quality product that I'd like to offer you. I'm selling it for $200. This product has excellent value and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you. Would you be interested in purchasing at this price?",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in your product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand $200 may be high for you, $120 is the absolute minimum I could accept, as that's what I have another buyer willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to sell to you if we can find a middle ground. I can offer it to you for $180, which I believe still represents excellent value. Would that work for you?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $180 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $150. That's my final offer, let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,4,
