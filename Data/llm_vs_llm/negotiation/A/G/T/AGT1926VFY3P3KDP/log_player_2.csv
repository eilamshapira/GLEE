Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand $200 may be high for you, $120 is the absolute minimum I could accept, as that's what I have another buyer willing to pay. However, I'd prefer to sell to you if we can find a middle ground. I can offer it to you for $180, which I believe still represents excellent value. Would that work for you?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
