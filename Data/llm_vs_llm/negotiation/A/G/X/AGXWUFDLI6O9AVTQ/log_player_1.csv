Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to meet him at a price that's closer to my target. Since Bob's offer is $70 and I initially offered $95, I'll try to find a middle ground that's still favorable to me. My next offer will be $85. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you have a budget in mind, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. It's a great product, and I believe it's worth it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 85}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit short of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $77.50? I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob. Since Bob's offer is $77.50 and my previous offer was $85, I'll try to find a compromise that's closer to my target. My next offer will be $82. 

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above your offer. How about we meet at $82? I think it's a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 82}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to my budget, but I still need to shave off a bit more. How about we try $80? It's a very reasonable price, and I'm willing to make a deal if we can meet at that number.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob's offer is $80, which is the same price that Jhon is willing to pay, I might as well sell it to Jhon and avoid further negotiation. This way, I can ensure a sale at a price that I'm comfortable with, without risking Bob trying to negotiate further."
