"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting high, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit. I believe this price is more reasonable while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to a lower offer or a deal falling through.  $1,100,000 is a good profit for me and a good price for Bob."
