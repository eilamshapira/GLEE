"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product.  Its value is significant, and I believe it has the potential to be transformative for your operations.  Given its unique nature and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1800000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given that:
1. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me
2. Alice's offer ($1,800,000) is more than twice my maximum value
3. John is willing to sell the product for $800,000
4. Alice's initial offer is significantly above my maximum value

I should either reject and try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John. Since Alice's initial offer is so high, it's unlikely we'll reach a reasonable price quickly, and I have a guaranteed option with John at my maximum value.
