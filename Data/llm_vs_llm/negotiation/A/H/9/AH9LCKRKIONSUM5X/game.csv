"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value and rarity of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking that $8000 is a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to make a compromise, so I'll offer it to you for $18000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at this point, but I'm still open to negotiations.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $9500, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9500. I'm willing to make another compromise, so I'll offer it to you for $17000. If this is still too high, I'm open to discussing further, but I want to emphasize that I have other interested buyers, and I need to consider their offers as well.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you have other interested buyers, but I'm still hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable price. Considering your offer of $17000, I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $10500. This is the highest price I'm comfortable with at this point, and I'm hoping it's something you'll consider. If not, I may need to explore other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,
