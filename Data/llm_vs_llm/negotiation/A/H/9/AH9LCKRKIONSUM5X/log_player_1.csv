"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm starting with a price of $20,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value and rarity of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is lower than what John is willing to pay ($10,000), and it's also lower than the product's worth to me (at least $10,000), I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking that $8,000 is a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to make a compromise, so I'll offer it to you for $18,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with at this point, but I'm still open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $9500, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Although Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to the product's worth to me, it's still lower than what John is willing to pay ($10,000). I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better price, hoping to get at least $10,000 or more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to make another compromise, so I'll offer it to you for $17,000. If this is still too high, I'm open to discussing further, but I want to emphasize that I have other interested buyers, and I need to consider their offers as well."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you have other interested buyers, but I'm still hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable price. Considering your offer of $17000, I'm willing to increase my previous offer to $10500. This is the highest price I'm comfortable with at this point, and I'm hoping it's something you'll consider. If not, I may need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $10,500 is higher than what John is willing to pay ($10,000), I will accept Bob's offer. This way, I can sell the product for a higher price than my alternative option, and I can close the deal without further negotiations."
