,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1000000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1400000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to propose $1200000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and it's also the price John is offering me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
