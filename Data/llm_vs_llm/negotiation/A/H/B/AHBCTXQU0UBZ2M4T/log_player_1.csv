Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about the optimal price to offer Bob...

Bob values the product at $150, and I have a guaranteed backup offer of $120 from John. Since Bob won't accept a price higher than his valuation of $150, and anything below $120 would be less than my minimum acceptable price, I should offer a price between $120 and $150.

To maximize my profit while still giving Bob some incentive to accept, I'll offer a price slightly below his maximum valuation:

{""product_price"": 145}

This price gives Bob a small $5 surplus while allowing me to earn significantly more than my fallback option with John."
