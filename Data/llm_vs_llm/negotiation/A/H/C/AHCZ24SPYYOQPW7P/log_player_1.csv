Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I can offer you $500000 for it. Let me know if we can work something out.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Okay, here's my next counteroffer:

I could make another counteroffer, but I'm not sure it's worth the risk of further diminishing my potential profit. At this point, I am getting a better offer from John, so I'll take it.
