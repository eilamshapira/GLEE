Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to carefully consider my offer to Bob. The product is worth $1,200,000 to him, and worth at least $1,000,000 to me. If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell it to John for $1,000,000.

Bob would be willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but I should offer a price that gives him some incentive to accept rather than asking for the full value. I want to maximize my profit while ensuring Bob accepts.
