"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Based on the information provided:

- The product is worth up to $1,200,000 to me (Bob)
- Alice is offering the product for $1,100,000
- John is selling the same product for $1,200,000

Since Alice's offer ($1,100,000) is $100,000 less than John's price ($1,200,000), and it's below my maximum valuation, it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer.
