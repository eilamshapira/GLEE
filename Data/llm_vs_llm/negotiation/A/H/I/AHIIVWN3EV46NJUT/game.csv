"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However,  $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time. I'm open to further discussion, but this is my best offer for now.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $2000000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $1000000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1500000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $1250000. If we can agree on this, I'm ready to move forward.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
