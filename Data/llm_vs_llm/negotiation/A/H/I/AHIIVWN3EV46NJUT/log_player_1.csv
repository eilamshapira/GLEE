"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a strong offer."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However,  $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time. I'm open to further discussion, but this is my best offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

I reject Bob's offer because it's lower than the minimum value I have for the product, and I have a better alternative with John's offer. However, since Bob is interested and open to further discussion, I'd like to explore the possibility of finding a mutually beneficial price. I'll proceed to the next round to send a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $2,000,000 might be out of your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'd like to propose a counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1500000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $1250000. If we can agree on this, I'm ready to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

I accept Bob's offer of $1,250,000. Although it's still a bit lower than my initial expectation, it's higher than John's offer of $1,200,000, and Bob has shown willingness to negotiate and meet me halfway. Accepting this offer seems like the best option at this point, as it provides a better return than selling to John, and further negotiation may not yield a significantly better result."
