"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, the initial price is a bit high for me. How about we start with $600000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $600000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $1800000, which is still a great deal. Let me know if this works for you.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks, Alice. I understand you want a higher price, but $1800000 is still too much for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $700000 is still not enough. Considering the product's value and the fact that I have another interested buyer, I'm willing to make a serious compromise. I can offer it to you for $1500000, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I still think that's too high for me. Let's try $750000. That's my final offer.",750000.0,Bob,6,
