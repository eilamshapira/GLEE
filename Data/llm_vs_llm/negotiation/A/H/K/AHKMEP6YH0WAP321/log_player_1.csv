Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, the initial price is a bit high for me. How about we start with $600000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my initial price and even lower than John's offer, I will reject it and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer, trying to get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $600,000 is a bit too low for me.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Since Bob's offer of $700,000 is still lower than John's offer of $1,000,000, I will reject it and proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer, trying to get a better deal. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than what John is offering."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $700,000 is still not enough.

Since Bob's offer of $750,000 is still lower than John's offer of $1,000,000, and Bob mentioned it's his final offer, I don't see any room for further negotiation. I will sell the product to John for $1,000,000, which is a better deal for me."
