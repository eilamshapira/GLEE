{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  While $14,000 is lower than John's price, it's still significantly higher than Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000). There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

**Reasoning:** This offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and is closer to the middle ground between her valuation and my maximum budget. It leaves room for further negotiation if needed."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but there's still room for negotiation. A $3,000 difference from our last offer is significant, and we might be able to meet somewhere in the middle."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between her last offer ($13,000) and my previous counteroffer ($10,000). It shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly below her initial offer."
