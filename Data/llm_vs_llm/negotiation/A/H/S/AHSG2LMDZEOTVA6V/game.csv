"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the perceived value of your product, the price is significantly higher than my current budget. I'm willing to offer $500000 for the product. This offer reflects my assessment of its market value and potential return on investment.  Please consider my counteroffer.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, I must inform you that $500000 is significantly below the product's actual value and my minimum acceptable price. I can reduce my initial asking price to $1800000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's quality and market potential. Would you consider this revised offer?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1800000 is still too high for me. I can increase my offer to $750000.  This is a substantial increase, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. If this doesn't work, I may have to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,4,
