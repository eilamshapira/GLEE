Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the perceived value of your product, the price is significantly higher than my current budget. I'm willing to offer $500000 for the product. This offer reflects my assessment of its market value and potential return on investment.  Please consider my counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a new counteroffer since $500,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but I still see potential to negotiate with Bob for a better price than John's offer.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, I must inform you that $500,000 is significantly below the product's actual value and my minimum acceptable price.

Would you consider this revised offer?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1800000 is still too high for me. I can increase my offer to $750000.  This is a substantial increase, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. If this doesn't work, I may have to explore other options.

I'll sell to John since Bob's offer of $750,000 is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000, and Bob's message suggests he's not likely to increase his offer substantially further. It's more profitable to take John's certain offer of $1,000,000 rather than risk continuing negotiations that may not reach my minimum acceptable price."
