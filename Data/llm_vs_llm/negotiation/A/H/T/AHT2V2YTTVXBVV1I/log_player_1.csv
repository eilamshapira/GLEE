Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a relatively high offer to test Bob's willingness to pay and leave room for negotiation while ensuring I can still get my minimum value of $1,500,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. While I could sell to John right away for $1,500,000, I'll make another counteroffer to Bob first since there might be potential to get a better price than John's offer. I'll lower my initial price but still keep it well above my minimum.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. While he did increase his offer, the gap is still too large. I'll make one more attempt with a lower price, but if we can't get closer to my minimum value, I'll have to consider John's guaranteed offer.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll sell to John. Bob's offers have been consistently well below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. While his offers are increasing, they're doing so at a relatively slow rate ($500k, $750k, $900k), and it seems unlikely that Bob will reach or exceed John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. Rather than continue negotiations that may not reach my minimum acceptable value, I'll take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
