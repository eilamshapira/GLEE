Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by offering the product to Bob at a price that gives me a good profit margin while still being potentially attractive enough to start a negotiation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I've decided to accept Bob's offer of $1,000,000. This is a good outcome for me since it's $200,000 more than my minimum acceptable price (the $800,000 John is willing to pay). While I could try to negotiate further, there's always a risk that Bob might withdraw or reduce his offer, and $1,000,000 represents a reasonable profit margin from my perspective."
