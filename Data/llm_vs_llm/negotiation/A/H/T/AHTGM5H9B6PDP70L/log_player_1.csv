Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth $100 to Bob
2. I have a guaranteed fallback of $80 from John
3. Bob will reject if the price is too high
4. I want to maximize my profit

Since Bob values the product at $100, offering slightly below that would give him an incentive to accept while maximizing my profit. I'll offer $95, which gives Bob a $5 surplus while giving me $15 more than my fallback option.
