"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Let me analyze the options:

1. Accept Alice's offer: $95
2. Reject Alice's offer
3. Buy from John: $100

Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and the product is worth no more than $100 to me:

- Alice's offer ($95) is lower than John's price ($100)
- $95 is below my maximum value ($100)
- I would save $5 by choosing Alice's offer over John's

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most economical choice.
