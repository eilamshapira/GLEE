"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth a premium price due to its high quality and unique features. I'm willing to let it go for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is significantly higher than market value for this product. I've done my research, and similar products are available for much less. I value your product, but I can only offer $60 for it. This is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $60 is too low for me. Considering the product's quality and uniqueness, I'm willing to lower my initial price to $170. I believe this is a more reasonable price, and I'm open to further negotiation.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get good value for your product, but $170 is still far above market value. I can actually get the same product elsewhere for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I can raise my offer to $70, which is a fair price considering the market conditions.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for raising your offer to $70. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering your target price and my initial price, I'm willing to lower my price to $160. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise, and I'm open to further negotiation.",160.0,Alice,5,
