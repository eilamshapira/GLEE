"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I believe it's worth a premium price due to its high quality and unique features. I'm willing to let it go for $180."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $180 is significantly higher than market value for this product. I've done my research, and similar products are available for much less. I value your product, but I can only offer $60 for it. This is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to compromise, but $60 is too low. 

My next offer will be: 
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $60 is too low for me. Considering the product's quality and uniqueness, I'm willing to lower my initial price to $170. I believe this is a more reasonable price, and I'm open to further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 170}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $60 is too low for me. Considering the product's quality and uniqueness, I'm willing to lower my initial price to $170.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get good value for your product, but $170 is still far above market value. I can actually get the same product elsewhere for $80. However, I'd prefer to do business with you. I can raise my offer to $70, which is a fair price considering the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since Bob's offer of $70 is still significantly lower than the product's worth to me, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I appreciate his willingness to raise his offer, but $70 is still too low. I'm starting to get a sense of Bob's target price, and I'll try to meet him halfway while still ensuring I get a good deal.

My next offer will be:
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for raising your offer to $70. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering your target price and my initial price, I'm willing to lower my price to $160. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise, and I'm open to further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 160}"

Round 5
