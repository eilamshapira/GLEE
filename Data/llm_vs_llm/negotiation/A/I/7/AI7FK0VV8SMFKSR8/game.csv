"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1000000? This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. How about we settle on $950000? I believe this is a fair price that takes into account both of our interests.",950000.0,Bob,4,
