"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","Okay, I need to decide whether to accept Alice's offer, reject it and negotiate further, or buy from John.

*   **Alice's offer:** $100
*   **My value:** Up to $150
*   **John's offer:** $150

Since $100 is less than my maximum value of $150, and also less than John's offer of $150, accepting Alice's offer is the best option.
