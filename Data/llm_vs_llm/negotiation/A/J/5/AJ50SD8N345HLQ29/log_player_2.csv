"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Looking at Alice's offer of $1,200,000 compared to John's price of $1,500,000:

- Alice's offer is $300,000 less than John's price
- The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me
- My goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible

Since Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's price, and still within my maximum value threshold, accepting Alice's offer is the financially prudent choice.
