Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm offering the product at $15,000 because:
1. I know it's worth exactly $15,000 to Bob
2. I won't accept less than $15,000 myself
3. I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $15,000

There's no incentive for me to offer a lower price since I can always sell to John at $15,000, and Bob won't pay more than the product's worth to him."
