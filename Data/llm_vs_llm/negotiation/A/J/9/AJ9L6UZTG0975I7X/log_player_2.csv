"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Given the information, Alice is offering to sell the product at $1,500,000, which is exactly the value of the product to her. However, this price is far above the maximum value of $800,000 that the product is worth to me (Bob). Additionally, I have the option to buy the same product from John for $800,000, which is equal to my maximum valuation.

There's no benefit to accepting Alice's current offer since it's significantly higher than my alternative. I should reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can negotiate a better price.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's significantly below Alice's initial price but allows some room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": $600,000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice has only slightly reduced her price from $1,500,000 to $1,400,000, which is still well above the $800,000 maximum value to me and the $800,000 price John is offering. This new offer doesn't provide any advantage over buying from John.

I should reject this offer and make another counteroffer. If Alice doesn't make a substantial concession in subsequent rounds, I'll eventually choose to buy from John.

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice is only making small concessions in her pricing ($100,000 decreases each time), and her current offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly higher than both my maximum valuation ($800,000) and John's alternative price ($800,000).

At this rate, even if Alice continues reducing by $100,000 each round, after 5 more rounds (which would be the end of our 10 round limit), she would still be at $800,000 - the same as John's price.

I should reject this offer and make another counteroffer, but I'll increase my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate while making it clear that we need to be closer to my price point.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's offer has dropped to $1,200,000, which is still $400,000 above John's price of $800,000. At the current pace of $100,000 reductions per round, we would need 4 more rounds to reach John's price, but we only have 3 rounds left after this one.

Since the product is only worth $800,000 to me, and John is offering exactly that price, continuing this negotiation doesn't seem to be leading to a better outcome than simply buying from John. The pattern suggests Alice won't drop below $900,000 within our remaining rounds.

At this point, it makes the most economic sense to buy from John.
