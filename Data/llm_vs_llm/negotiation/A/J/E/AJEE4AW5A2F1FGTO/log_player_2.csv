# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this exclusive product at a special price of $15000. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000 and the guaranteed price from John. You should reject the offer and see if Alice will come down on the price or move on to buying from John."
