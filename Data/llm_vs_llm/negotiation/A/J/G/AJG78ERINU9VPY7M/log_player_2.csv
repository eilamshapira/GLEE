"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $115. It's a fair price, considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Let me think about this strategically:

1. The product is worth $100 to Alice, so she has room to negotiate down
2. John's price is $120, which is my absolute maximum and worst-case scenario
3. Alice's offer of $115 is better than John's price, but still seems high given that it's worth $100 to her
4. I could try to negotiate for a better price since I know she has a $15 margin to work with

Given these factors, I'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate for a better price. Even if negotiations fail, I can still fall back on John's offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's reasonably lower but still gives Alice a decent profit:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $115 seems a bit high. Given market conditions, I'd be willing to pay $105 for the product. This still gives you a fair profit, and I think it's a reasonable price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}"
