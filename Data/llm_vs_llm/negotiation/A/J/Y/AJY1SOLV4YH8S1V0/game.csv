"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I need to be mindful of my budget. The product is worth no more than $15000 to me, which is the price that John is also offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $12000 for the product. This allows you to make a sale today while giving me some value compared to my alternative option.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and offer. I appreciate you sharing your situation. While I understand budget constraints, I need to consider the true value of this product. Since you mentioned the product is worth up to $15000 to you, I'm willing to meet you closer to that value point. I can offer it to you for $14500, which gives you a $500 advantage compared to your alternative option while still reflecting the product's quality and value. This represents a $4000 reduction from my initial offer, showing my commitment to reaching a fair agreement with you.",14500.0,Alice,3,
