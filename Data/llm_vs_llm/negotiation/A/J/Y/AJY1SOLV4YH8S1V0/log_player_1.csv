Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I need to be mindful of my budget. The product is worth no more than $15000 to me, which is the price that John is also offering. However, I'd prefer to do business with you if we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer $12000 for the product. This allows you to make a sale today while giving me some value compared to my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your interest and offer. I appreciate you sharing your situation. While I understand budget constraints, I need to consider the true value of this product. Since you mentioned the product is worth up to $15,000 to you, I'm willing to meet you closer to that value point. I can offer it to you for $14,500, which gives you a $500 advantage compared to your alternative option while still reflecting the product's quality and value. This represents a $4,000 reduction from my initial offer, showing my commitment to reaching a fair agreement with you."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
