"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","Given that the product is worth $120 to me and only $100 to Bob, I know that Bob won't be willing to pay more than $100. However, I have the advantage of having John's guaranteed offer of $120. Therefore, I'll start high but not too aggressive to see if there's any room for negotiation with Bob.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since I have John's guaranteed offer of $120 and the product is worth $120 to me, accepting Bob's offer of $90 would mean a loss of $30 compared to selling to John. Bob's offer is also below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 

Given that Bob is only willing to pay up to $100 (as that's what the product is worth to him), and his current offer is well below that, there's no realistic possibility of reaching a deal that would be better than John's offer.

Therefore, the most rational decision is to end the negotiation with Bob and take John's guaranteed offer.
