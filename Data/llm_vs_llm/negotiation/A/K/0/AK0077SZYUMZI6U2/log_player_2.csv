(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's initial offer of $135 is well above both my maximum value ($100) and John's price ($100), I'll make a reasonable counteroffer that's lower but still gives some room for negotiation.
