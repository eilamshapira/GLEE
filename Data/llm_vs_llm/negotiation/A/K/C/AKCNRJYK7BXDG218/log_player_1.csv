Send your offer to Bob.,"I need to determine a price that maximizes my earnings while ensuring Bob is likely to accept.

The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, meaning he won't pay more than that.
The product is worth at least $12,000 to me, and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John at exactly $12,000.

If I set the price too high, Bob might reject it, and I'll only get $12,000 from John.
If I set the price too low (below $12,000), I'd be losing money compared to my alternative.

Ideally, I want to capture some of the $3,000 difference between Bob's valuation ($15,000) and my guaranteed alternative ($12,000).

I'll offer a price that gives Bob some incentive to accept while maximizing my profit:

{""product_price"": 13500}"
