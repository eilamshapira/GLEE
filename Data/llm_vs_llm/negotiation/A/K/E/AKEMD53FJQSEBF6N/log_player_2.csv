"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Given the situation, Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is $500,000 less than John's price of $1,500,000. Since the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, and Alice's offer is lower than that maximum value, it makes financial sense to accept Alice's offer.
