"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product available that I believe will suit your needs perfectly. I'm offering it to you for $20000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Let me analyze this situation:

1. The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me
2. Alice is offering the product for $20,000
3. John is offering the same product for $12,000
4. If I accept Alice's offer, I'll pay $8,000 more than the product's worth to me
5. If I buy from John, I'll pay exactly what the product is worth to me

It's clear that Alice's offer ($20,000) is significantly higher than both:
- The product's value to me ($12,000)
- John's alternative offer ($12,000)

Therefore, the most rational decision is to buy from John.
