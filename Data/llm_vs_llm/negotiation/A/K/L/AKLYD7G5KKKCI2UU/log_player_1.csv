"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer.

My counteroffer is: $1,800,000

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me at this price or at least increase his offer significantly. If not, I still have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and not significantly closer to my previous counteroffer of $1,800,000, I will reject his offer.

At this point, I don't see Bob's offers increasing substantially towards my target, so I will consider selling to John for $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.
