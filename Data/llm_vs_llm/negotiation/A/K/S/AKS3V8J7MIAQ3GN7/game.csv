"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Given its rarity and high demand, I believe it's worth a premium price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000, which I think is a fair value considering its unique features and benefits.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the unique features of this product, but I need it to be within my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $600000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to make an offer. However, I must say that $600000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and the other offers I have on the table. I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $1000000, which is still a competitive price given its unique features and benefits.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value proposition, but $1000000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $700000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. Considering your offer of $700000 and the value of the product, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $850000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair value for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
