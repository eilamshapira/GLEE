Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the unique features of this product, but I need it to be within my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $600000?

Since Bob's offer of $600,000 is lower than what John is willing to pay ($800,000), and it's also lower than the product's value to me, I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
