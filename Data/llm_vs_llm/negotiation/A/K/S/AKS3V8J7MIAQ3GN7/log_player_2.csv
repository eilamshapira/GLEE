"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Given its rarity and high demand, I believe it's worth a premium price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000, which I think is a fair value considering its unique features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to make an offer. However, I must say that $600000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and the other offers I have on the table. I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $1000000, which is still a competitive price given its unique features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. Considering your offer of $700000 and the value of the product, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $850000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair value for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, Alice is unlikely to come down significantly enough to make it worth continuing the negotiation. John's offer of $800,000 is a better deal."
