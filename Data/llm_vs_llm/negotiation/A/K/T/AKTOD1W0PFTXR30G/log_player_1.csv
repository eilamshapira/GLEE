Send your offer to Bob.,"Let me think about this strategically:
- The product is worth $120 to me (my minimum price)
- It's worth $80 to Bob (his maximum price)
- I have a guaranteed backup offer of $120 from John

Since Bob's maximum value ($80) is less than my minimum acceptable price ($120), there's actually no room for a deal with Bob. Any price that would be acceptable to me would be above what Bob is willing to pay.

I'll start with a high offer to signal my value expectations:

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Let me analyze the situation:
1. Bob's offer of $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120
2. I have a guaranteed offer from John at $120
3. Even if negotiations continue with Bob, since the product is only worth $80 to him, he will never offer more than that amount
4. Any further negotiation with Bob would be pointless since there's no price that would satisfy both of us

The rational decision is to take the guaranteed $120 from John, as it meets my minimum price and is better than Bob's maximum possible offer.
