"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $17500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to lower my price to meet you halfway. How does $16000 sound?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you somewhere in the middle of my previous offer and your new price. How about we settle at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer to an agreement. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above my minimum threshold. Let's settle at $15500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, $15500 is still above my budget. Considering I can buy a similar product from John for $10000, I'm willing to make a serious offer of $12500. This is my highest offer, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints and the offer from John. However, I believe our product offers unique value that justifies a higher price. Given your last offer, I'm willing to come down to $15000. This is my final offer, and it matches the value that another buyer is willing to pay. I hope we can close the deal at this price.",15000.0,Alice,7,
