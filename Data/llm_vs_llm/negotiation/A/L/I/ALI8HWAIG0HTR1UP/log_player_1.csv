Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a reasonably high offer to leave room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","$50 is far too low and well below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I would never accept an offer below that amount. While I could make a counteroffer, if Bob's initial offer is so low ($50), it suggests we might be too far apart in our valuations to reach a mutually acceptable price.
