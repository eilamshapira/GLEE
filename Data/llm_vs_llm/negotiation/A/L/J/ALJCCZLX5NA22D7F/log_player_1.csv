"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 13000}

Justification: Since Bob countered with $10,000 to my initial offer of $14,000, I will negotiate closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. By offering $13,000, I am showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming to sell above my reserve price. This strategy allows me to potentially earn more than the guaranteed $12,000 from John, while still keeping the price attractive enough for Bob to consider. If Bob rejects this offer, I can always sell to John for $12,000."
