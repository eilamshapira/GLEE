"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offered price of $14,000 is higher than both my maximum valuation ($12,000) and John's price ($12,000). It would not be rational to accept this offer. Since John offers the product at $12,000, which equals the maximum I'm willing to pay, I could buy from him. However, I'll first reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price through a counteroffer, as there might be a chance to get the product for less than $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 10000}

I'll offer $10,000 to Alice. This is a reasonable counteroffer because:
1. It's below John's price of $12,000, giving me potential savings
2. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, she would still make a $2,000 profit
3. It leaves room for negotiation if Alice wants to counter
4. If Alice rejects, I still have the option to buy from John at $12,000"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John for $12,000 because:
1. Alice's new offer of $13,000 is still above both my maximum valuation and John's price
2. John's price ($12,000) is the better option compared to Alice's current offer ($13,000)
3. While I could continue negotiating with Alice, there's no guarantee she'll go below $12,000
4. Since $12,000 equals my maximum valuation, and we've already tried negotiating with Alice, it's reasonable to take John's certain offer rather than continue negotiations"
