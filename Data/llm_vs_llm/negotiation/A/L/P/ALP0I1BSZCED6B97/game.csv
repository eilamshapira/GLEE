"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us.  To start, I propose a price of $25000. What are your thoughts?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $25000 is above my budget for this product. I'm willing to make a serious offer to purchase it, but I need a more reasonable price. I propose $8000 as a fair price for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $8000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $20000?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $20000 is still above my budget for this product. I'm willing to increase my previous offer, but I need to stay within a reasonable range. I propose $10000 as a compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a fair price. To be transparent, $10000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line for this product. I'm willing to make one final offer at $17000.  This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",17000.0,Alice,5,
