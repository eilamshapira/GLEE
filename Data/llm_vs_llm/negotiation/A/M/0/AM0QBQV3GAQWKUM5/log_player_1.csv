"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price.  I'm also hoping to gauge Bob's interest level with this initial offer."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is way too low.  While I need to be mindful of the time constraint, I'm not willing to sell for that price. I will counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will get us closer to an agreement."

I'm counteroffering at $1,500,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm hopeful that Bob will see it as a genuine effort to reach an agreement. This is also the price John is willing to pay, so I'm not taking a huge risk by offering this."
