"Alice, your product looks great, but $19500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for it. This is a fair price given my budget and the value of the product to me.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $13000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product's quality and market value justify a higher price. However, I can reduce my initial asking price to $17000, which is a significant reduction and represents excellent value for this product.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14500 for it. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's closer to your acceptable value. What do you think?",14500.0,Bob,4,
