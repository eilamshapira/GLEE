"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be valuable for you. Given its quality and market value, I'm offering it at $19,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 19500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product looks great, but $19500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for it. This is a fair price given my budget and the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer since Bob's offer of $13,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting his offer would result in a loss compared to selling to John. However, there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob than John's $15,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept $13,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. The product's quality and market value justify a higher price. However, I can reduce my initial asking price to $17,000, which is a significant reduction and represents excellent value for this product."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14500 for it. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's closer to your acceptable value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell to John for $15,000. Bob's offer of $14,500 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $15,000, and there's no guarantee that further negotiations with Bob will result in a better price. It's best to take the sure profit with John rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might not exceed $15,000."
