Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate on this product. However, I believe there's room for a more mutually beneficial arrangement. While the product is worth $1500000 to me, I'm aware that its value to you is significantly lower. I'm prepared to offer $1250000 for the product, which would provide you with a $50000 profit while also allowing me to save considerably compared to John's price. This creates a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for lowering your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1400000 is better than John's offer, I believe we can find a price point that's even more beneficial for both of us. Since the product is worth $1200000 to you, I'm proposing $1325000. This gives you a healthy $125000 profit while allowing me to save significantly compared to alternative options. This middle ground represents a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you continuing to work with me on finding a fair price, Alice. Your offer of $1375000 shows good progress in our negotiation.
