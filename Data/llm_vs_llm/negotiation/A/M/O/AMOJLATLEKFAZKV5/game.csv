"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and rarity, I'm pricing it at $17000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth and I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I was thinking of a lower price point. Would you be willing to sell the product for $5000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $5000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $16000, which is the lowest I'm comfortable with at this point.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $16000 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. How about $6000?",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $6000 is still significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to the product's true value. I can offer it to you for $14500, which is the lowest I'm willing to go at this point.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14500 is still too high for me. I can offer $7000, which is closer to what I'm looking to spend.",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $7000 is still not close enough to the product's value. I've compromised significantly already, and I'm not willing to go much lower. I can offer it to you for $14000, which is a serious concession on my part. If we can't meet at this price, I may need to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,7,
