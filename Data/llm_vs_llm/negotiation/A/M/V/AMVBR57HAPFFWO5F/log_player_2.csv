"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll analyze the situation:

Alice offers the product for $10,000, which is $5,000 less than:
1) My maximum value for the product ($15,000)
2) John's alternative price ($15,000)

This is already a good deal that saves me $5,000 compared to buying from John. Since my goal is to buy the product while saving as much money as possible, and there's always risk in negotiation that the price could increase, I should accept this offer.
