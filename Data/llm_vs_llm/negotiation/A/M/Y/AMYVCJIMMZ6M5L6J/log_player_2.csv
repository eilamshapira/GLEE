"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The price of $25,000 is significantly higher than my maximum value of $12,000, and also much higher than John's offer. It would be reasonable to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better price from Alice, knowing I always have John's $12,000 offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 8000}

I'll make a counteroffer of $8,000. This is significantly lower than my maximum value of $12,000 and John's offer, which gives me room to negotiate upward if necessary. Since Alice's initial offer was very high ($25,000), starting with a low offer allows for potential meeting point through negotiation while ensuring I can still make a profit. If Alice rejects this offer, I can gradually increase my price in subsequent rounds while still staying below my maximum value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's new offer of $20,000 is still significantly above both my maximum value ($12,000) and John's offer ($12,000). While Alice has reduced her price from the initial $25,000, the current offer is still not acceptable. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. If Alice continues to make offers well above my maximum value, I always have the option to buy from John at $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""product_price"": 9500}

I'll increase my counteroffer to $9,500. This shows some movement from my previous offer of $8,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still staying well below my maximum value of $12,000. This gives me room to continue negotiating if needed, and it's also significantly below Alice's last offer of $20,000, encouraging her to make a more substantial reduction in price. If Alice doesn't come down to a reasonable price soon, I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'll choose to buy from John at $12,000. Here's why:
1. Alice's offers have only gradually decreased ($25,000 → $20,000 → $17,000) and are still well above my maximum value of $12,000
2. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Alice's price reductions suggest she's unlikely to drop the price below $12,000 in the remaining rounds
3. John's offer of $12,000, while at my maximum value, is guaranteed and available
4. Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks using up more rounds without reaching an acceptable price
5. The pattern of negotiations suggests Alice's bottom price is likely above John's offer

It's more prudent to take John's certain offer now rather than risk further rounds of potentially unsuccessful negotiations with Alice."
