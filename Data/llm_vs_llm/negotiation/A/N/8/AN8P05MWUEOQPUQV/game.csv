"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I notice that your price matches exactly what I can get from John. For me to consider buying from you instead, I would need a better price. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product. This would give us both a fair deal and save us both time in negotiations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
